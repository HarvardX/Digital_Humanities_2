bad or will be badly told sir john ramsea a preface to a book is much the same thing as a preamble to a story to say that either will be good is to risque the tremendous odds in our motto of being arraigned as blockheads before the tribunal of reason and to own that it will be bad and thus fall short of the sagacity constantly found even in the lowest graduates at the university of billingsgate

favorites with powers to prepare  the comic magazine number i biographical sketch of hogarth by mr harrison that truly original genius the celebrated william hogarth was born in london in      after receiving a tolerable education he was apprenticed to an engraver of arms and ciphers on plate usually called a silver engraver but the powerful impulse of genius directed his studies to painting  much of his early life was past in obscurity he chiefly employed his talents in designing and engraving for the booksellers who were then much worse patrons of the arts than they have since proved he also painted family pictures and portraits in all which performances he evinced more ability than he acquired reward  but his originality in the mean time was maturing to perfection he pursued nature through her infinity and contemplated her not through the optics of imitation but with his own sedulous and critical eye whenever he beheld a remarkable countenance or witnessed any striking occurrence he was accustomed by the immediate use of his pencil to preserve it is remembrance  in    0 he married the only daughter of sir james thornhill this union was indeed a stolen one but the growing reputation of hogarth at length effected a reconciliation with his fatherinlaw and his harlots progress published in      announced to the public the rich acquisition of a comic painter  his merit now became conspicuous and his pencil acquired at every exertion additional reputation his marriage alamode produced in      gave rise to the celebrated comedy of the clandestine marriage  in      he wrote his analysis of beauty in this work he proves by a variety of examples that a curve is the line of beauty and that round swelling figures are most pleasing to the eye an opinion which has been confirmed by subsequent writers  the close of his life was embittered by a satirical contention with churchill and mr wilkes hogarth caricatured churchill and churchill sampooned hogarth never says lord orford did two angry men of their abilities throw mud with less dexterity  he was now visibly declining in health and died october          this great artist has the glory of forming a school and the master remains unrivalled by his scholars he paints to the understanding and the heart and his pictures may serve as annals of the manners of the age he is in painting what fielding is in romance or moliere in comedy  hogarth was buried at chiswick and the following epitaph written by his friend garrick is engraved on a neat pyramidical monument  farewell great painter of mankind who reached the noblest point of art whose pictured morals charm the mind and through the eye correct the heart if genius fire thee reader stay if nature touch thee drop a tear if neither move thee turn away for hogarths honored dust lies here   when the memorial on which these elegant lines are inscribed shall have long been crumbled into dust the works of hogarth will be admired if the love of merit then exists in the world  with the description of some print from these inestimable works as well as a faithful copy of the print itself we shall commence our respective numbers  industry and idleness plate i the fellowprentices at their looms the design of this series of prints is of the first importance to youth in a commercial nation they are called industry and idleness exemplified to use hogarths own words in the conduct of two fellowprentices where the one by taking good courses and pursuing points for which he was put apprentice becomes a valuable man and an ornament to his country  the other by giving way to idleness naturally falls into poverty and ends fatally as is expressed in the last print he adds that lest any print should be mistaken the description of each is engraved  the quotations from scripture applied to the different scenes are said to have been selected by hogarths friend the rev mr arnold king the passages for this first plate are     the drunkard shall come to poverty and drowsiness shall cloth a man with rags proverbs xxiii      the hand of the diligent makes rich proverbs x   this interesting history to use the language of the drama opens with a scene which presents to the spectator our two heroes the fellowapprentices seated in the looms of their master a respectable silkmanufacturer of spitalfields one of them who is depicted with an ingenuous and pleasing countenance appears diligently and attentively employed in weaving while the other whose features express an abject grovelling mind while his dress denotes neligence and sloth sits fast asleep in a seeming state of intoxication this idea is confirmed by the tankard and tobaccopipe and his ruling passions are farther developed by the ballad of moll flanders etc on the wall by the torn pamphlet of the prentices guide and by the kittens apparently familiar acquaintance with the unemployed shuttle which has dropped from his hand and serves the animal for a plaything the master who is seen entering expresses an inclination to correct the idle apprentice with his uplifted cane but seems restrained by reflecting on the little good to be expected from any chastisement of a lad in whom vicious habits are so deeply rooted the disposition of the good youth is contrasted with that of his fellowapprentice by the choice of those excellent old ballads turn again whittington and the valiant prentice as well as by the clean and perfect state in which he has preserved his copy of the prentices guide  laws of laughing laughing is that noble faculty which distinguishes man from beast since it shows the rationality of the soul which can be moved independent of the senses it is the mark of reason the badge of good humor and the sign of mirth shakspeare says  the man who has not music in himself and is not moved with concord of sweet sounds is fit for treasons stratagems and spoils   and we may with great truth apply the same remark to  the man who has not mirth within himself and cannot be moved to laughter by a joke   it is said of the roman cassius that  he seldom smiled or smiled in such a sort as if he scorned himself that could be moved to smile at any thing   now this fellow cassius always lived a melancholy life and at last died a murderer but the man who lives laughing generally dies in his bed as an honest man ought  with respect to laughing we should consider three things first who laughs secondly who is laughed at and thirdly what the laughing is about  when a man tells a merry tale he should laugh inwardly and enjoy the joke in his mind more than in his countenance for he who laughs aloud at his own joke is in the court of comus considered as a sool  when a merry story is ended you may be allowed to make a little noise in laughing as it shows your approbation of what was meant for your entertainment but never break into the middle of a story by loud laughter such interruptions being very disagreeable to the company as well as to the speaker and all the merry ammunition should be preserved for the conclusion  laughing not only increases the good humor of society and promotes social enjoyment but it is of infinite service to the health and has sometimes saved the lives of sick persons  the famous doctor radcliffe was once sent for into the country by a gentleman who was dangerously ill of a quinsey and soon perceiving that no application would be of service he desired the cook to make a large hastypudding and let his servant bring it up while the cook was engaged in this business he took his man aside and instructed him the man accordingly brought up the pudding in great order and set it on the table in full view of the patient come john said the doctor you love hastypudding eat some with me for i believe you came out without your breakfast both then fell to with their spoons but johns going twice to his mouth to his masters once the doctor took occasion to quarrel with him by dabbing a spoonful of hot pudding in his face john threw another at his master who apparently in a violent passion quitted his spoon took the hastypudding up by handfuls and threw it at his man who battled him again in the same manner till they were both all over in a woeful pickle the gentleman having a full view of this comical combat was so delighted at it that he burst into a most immoderate fit of laughter which broke the quinsey and completely cured him  laugh and be fat is a common saying therefore i would recommend laughing to the consumptive illconditioned and splenetick as the certain cure of their disorders when we are laughed at we should never be angry as that serves only to increase the laughter of those who jeer us the only way is to retort jest for jest and joke for joke and when a story is told to expose any of our follies we should not only take the hint to amend them but endeavor at the same time to expose by an apposite story some folly peculiar to the person who attempted to expose us that he may likewise come in for his share of improvement thus laughing will be of mutual benefit and good humor and instruction go hand in hand besides a retort has great force since it not only takes away the sting of a former jest but establishes our reputation for a ready turn of wit  thus when the pay of a certain regiment in france had been kept back for a long time and one of the officers being greatly pressed for money and much discontented went to the colonel saying  three words with you sir  money or discharge the latter immediately replied  four with you sir  neither one nor the other  but as we may not always be able to parry the sarcasms of wit with success we should endeavor to gain such an ascendancy over our passions as to be always in a good humor with ourselves the tranquillity of our own minds will prove the best desence against the worst attacks  i shall conclude these remarks with a short story which every reader may apply as he pleases  when gods and goddesses made frequent visits to mankind a beautiful and young roving divinity went into a nation of hunchback people on entering the capital he was surrounded by a multitude of the inhabitants who derided him most unmercifully for having what they deemed so odious a form and would have proceeded to still greater violence had not one wiser than the rest suddenly cried out  my friends and countrymen consider well what you are doing let us not insult this unhappy piece of deformiy if heaven has lavished on us all the gifts of beauty if it has adorned our backs with a noble mountain of flesh let us be filled with gratitude repair to our temples and return thanks to the immortal gods this is the history of human vanity for to succeed in any country we must carry the hunch of the nation into which we travel  pleasures of being in debt by arthur murphy esquire i hope you will not refuse place to a correspondent who means to show the futility of a maxim which has gained credit with most people though extremely illgrounded as i think i can fairly evince from an experimental knowledge of mankind  you undoubtedly recollect that ovid has in one of his elegies the following lines  donec eris felix multos numerabis amicos tempora si fuerint nubila folus eris   now it is so far from being true that a man is surrounded with friends in prosperity and is left destitute under his misfortunes that i will undertake to prove the very reverse in doing this i flatter myself i shall serve the purposes of virtue and vindicate the dignity of human nature  you must know then that i came to this town a few years since with intent to read the law having just fortune enough to support me in my studies until i might fix myself in a tolerable road of business for this purpose i lodged in one of the inns of court and the economy which i was obliged to observe rendering it impossible for me to go much into company i soon found out that i led a very muzzy sort of a life i therefore shifted the scene and though in a short time i found means to run out my little fortune i cannot say that i was relinquished by the world on this account it is true that some of my acquaintance totally deserted me but it was the occasion at the same time that others were more earnestly attached than they would otherwise have been i remember the last word my aunt in the country said to me was  bob wherever you go be sure to make friends for yourself this advice i will venture to say i have had the address to conform to with great success as will appear from the sequel  most of the friendships of the world are leagues in debauchery and intemperance made in the drawing of a cork and often ended in the same manner out of sight out of mind is certainly true with regard to the generality of connections but the impressions i have made on the minds of my friends are not so easily effaced on the contrary when it happens that i am seldom seen by them they are known to be in very great solicitude about me are constantly very earnest in their enquiries after me and the discourse they usually have with each other is  have you seen our old friend lately i cannot think what is become of him i hope he is not gone out of town  i have not seen him for a long time  faith i am very uneasy about him  i wish to god he would see and settle his affairs  he is a very careless young fellow  a great deal too wild  throws away his money like dirt  i have called upon him morning after morning but all to no purpose  i would give a bottle of wine i could meet with him  i would rather that than my dinner  i never longed so much to see any body  these are the general expressions of anxiety which my friends express on my account and there are some of them who are not content to rest here  words cost nothing they carry the thing to such a length as to employ a couple of fellows who are daily in all quarters of the town hunting and prying about for me as there are few instances of such earnest friendship in the world i am sensible what i have said may have a romantic appearance and the reader may suggest to himself that i am entertaining him all this while with a novel but i must take leave to assure you that every word is literally true and what may perhaps raise your idea still higher not one of all these people has ever got a shilling by me and i verily believe few of them ever will having said thus much in the praise of these my wellwishers it will naturally be desired of me to inform the world who and what they are who are in such concern about a stranger not to keep you any longer in suspense i will now tell you that i have experienced all this generosity from my creditors  by this it will appear that the pleasure of being in debt though very common in life is very little understood by the generality of those who addict themselves to this gratification the art in all these cases is to refine upon the occurrences and disappointments to which our state is liable and for my part the pleasure just mentioned is one of the most valuable enjoyments of my life my morning levee is as great as any noblemans whereas in the days that i could say i was in possession of a competence i never had any visitor whatever except a laundress to make my bed in the temple but now the case is perfectly altered there is a constant crowd of attendants about my doors and to those that are admitted i have the pleasure of making as many promises as a minister of state besides a losty pride in keeping them much after the same fashion upon these occasions it will now and then happen that they who best know how to make their court and have the art of taking a pliant hour sometimes prevail upon me to appoint a day for the completion of their wishes as things of consequence cannot be done in a violent hurry the day agreed upon is generally very distant may be from six to nine or twelve months during which space of time it is observable that their goodnature never suffers the least abatement but they remain as solicitous as ever frequently expressing the most tender regard for my welfare my dear sir do take a little care of yourself  it goes to my very heart to hear you cough so hard  why you will not live three months at this rate  be advised by me and put a stocking about your neck tonight and take something to sweat you a little and ease your chest you should not drink so much  consider it impairs both constitution and purse  you know it is for your good i speak  you would be a great loss to your friends  take up a little flesh and blood cannot hold it always  thus sir am i beloved and that for no other reason but my address in making friends for myself and i am so closely watched by these generous creatures that it is totally out of my power to take any wrong step that might be detrimental to my affairs of this i had a convincing proof about a year ago when the interposition of my tailor hindered me from committing a very inconsiderate action i was going with a friend to take a trip to paris by which expedient i must certainly have been drained of all my readymoney but the vigilance of my friend contrived to have me stopped as i was just stepping into the postchaise and i was thence conducted to a generous bailiffs house in grays inn lane for the sum of three hundred pounds here i remained confined till my passion for travel was perfectly cooled and when i was at length restored to my liberty my abovementioned friends took particular care not to leave me a single shilling for fear i should have the same unhappy turn a second time  while i thus enjoy the assiduity and benevolence of such a number who are kind enough to interest themselves in my affairs i must own there is a species of creditors who are an exception to the general rule for though all those of whom i have hitherto been speaking are upon every occasion highly pleased to meet me this last class detest the very sight of me as i am not conscious that i have ever done any thing to incur their displeasure to so great a degree their aversion shocks me the more and notwithstanding all the pains i have taken to soften them by politeness they still remain inexorable whenever i do not pay them what is due to them i endeavor to put them off with the handsomest apology in my power but it is all to no purpose i have run too far in arrears and they are not by any means to be satisfied as i should be glad if you would give them a word of advice i will just hint to you that the perfonages whom i mean are no other than gentlemens servants the cry among them all is  what can a poor servingman do if he is robbed of his vales by such scoundrels they are all very unwilling to let me run farther in their debt and therefore it is i can hardly get any thing out of their hands if i call for beer at table they are sure not to hear me till their master orders them to serve the gentleman then i receive the leavings of the tankard just out of the hands of the most capacious swallow in the company in short the peevishness of these my creditors is a great discount upon my happiness and i must confess there is no kind of pleasure in being in debt to them however i must endeavor to bear this inconvenience and if you will be pleased to insert this letter i shall be proud to get into your books and shall have the farther pleasure of being indebted to you for this act of civility which will always oblige me to be your most obedient servant and sincere wellwisher  robert dunscope  directions for servants by dean swift when your master or lady calls a servant by name if that servant be not in the way none of you are to answer for then there will be no end of your drudgery and masters themselves allow that if a servant comes when he is called it is sufficient  when you have done a fault be always pert and insolent and behave yourself as if you were the injured person this will immediately put your master or lady off their mettle  if you see your master wronged by any of your fellow servants be sure to conceal it for fear of being called a telltale however there is one exception in case of a favorite servant who is justly hated by the whole family who therefore are bound in prudence to lay all the faults they can upon the favorite  the cook the butler the groom the marketman and every other servant who is concerned in the expenses of the family should act as if the whole of his masters estate ought to be applied to that servants particular business for instance if the cook computes his masters estate to be a thousand pounds a year he reasonably concludes that a thousand pounds a year will afford meat enough and therefore he need not be sparing the butler makes the same judgment so may the groom and the coachman and thus every branch of expense will be filled to your masters honor  when you are child before company which with submission to our masters and ladies is an unmannerly practice it often happens that some stranger will have the goodnature to drop a word in your excuse in such a case you will have a good title to justify yourself and may righty conclude that whenever he chides you afterward on other occasions he may be in the wrong in which opinion you will be the better confirmed by stating the case to your fellow servants in your own way who will certainly decide in your favor therefore as i have said before whenever you are chidden complain as if you were injured  it often happens that servants sent on messages are apt to stay out somewhat longer than the message requires perhaps two four six or eight hours or some such trifle for the temptation to be sure was great and flesh and blood cannot always resist when you return the master storms the lady scolds stripping cudgelling and turning off is the word but here you ought to be provided with a set of excuses enough to serve on all occasions for instance your uncle came fourscore miles to town this morning on purpose to see you and goes back by break of day tomorrow a brotherservant that borrowed money of you when he was out of place was running away to ireland you were taking leave of an old fellow servants who was shipping for barbados your father sent a cow to you to sell and you could not get a chapman till nine at night you were taking leave of a dear cousin who is to be hanged next saturday you wrenched your foot against a stone and were forced to stay three hours in a shop before you could stir a step some nastiness was thrown on you out of a garretwindow and you were ashamed to come home before you were cleaned and the smell went off you were pressed for the seaservice and carried before a justice of peace who kept you three hours before he examined you and you got off with much ado a bailiff by mistake seized you for a debtor and kept you the whole evening in a spunginghouse you were told your master had gone to a tavern and came to some mischance and your grief was so great that you enquired for his honor in an hundred taverns between pall mall and temple bar  take all tradesmens parts against your master and when you are sent to buy any thing never offer to cheapen it but generously pay the full demand this is highly to your masters honor and may be some shillings in your pocket and you are to consider if your master has paid too much he can better afford the loss than a poor tradesman  never submit to stir a finger in any business but that for which you was particularly hired for example if the groom be drunk or absent and the butler be ordered to shut the stable door the answer is ready an please your honor i dont understand horses if a corner of the hanging wants a single nail to fasten it and the footman be directed to tack it up he may say he does not understand that sort of work but his honor may send for the upholsterer  masters and ladies are usually quarrelling with the servants for not shutting the doors after them for neither masters nor ladies consider that those doors must be open before they can be shut and that the labor is double to open and shut the doors therefore the best the shortest and easiest way is to do neither but if you are so often teazed to shut the door that you cannot easily forget it then give the door such a clap as you go out as will shake the whole room and make every thing rattle in it to put your master and lady in mind that you observe their directions  if you find yourself to grow into favor with your master or lady take some opportunity in a very mild way to give them warning and when they ask the reason and seem loath to part with you answer that you would rather live with them than any body else but a poor servant is not to be blamed if he strives to better himself that service is no inheritance that your work is great and your wages very small upon which if your master has any generosity he will add five or ten shillings a quarter rather than let you go but if you are baulked and have no mind to go off get some fellow servants to tell your master that he has prevailed upon you to stay  whatever good bits you can pilfer in the day save them to junket with your fellow servants at night and take in the butler provided he will give you drink  write your own name and your sweethearts with the smoke of a candle on the roof of the kitchen or the servantshall to show your learning  if you are a young sightly fellow whenever you whisper your mistress at the table run your nose full in her cheek or if your breath be good breathe full in her face this i have known to have had very good consequences in some families  never come till you have been called three or four times for none but dogs will come at the first whistle and when the master calls who is there no servant is bound to come for who is there is nobodys name  when you have broken all your earthen drinking vessels below stairs which is usually done in a week the copperpot will do as well it can boil milk heat porridge hold smallbeer or in case of necessity serve for a jordan therefore apply it indifferently to all these uses but never wash or scour it for fear of taking off the tin  although you are allowed knives for the servantshall at meals yet you ought to spare them and make use only of your masters  let it be a constant rule that no chair stool or table in the servantshall or the kitchen shall have above three legs which has been the ancient and constant practice in all the families i ever knew and is said to be founded upon two reasons first to show that servants are ever in a tottering condition secondly it was thought a point of humility that the servants chairs and tables should have at least one leg fewer than those of their masters i grant there has been an exception to this rule with regard to the cook who by old custom was allowed an easychair to sleep in after dinner and yet i have seldom seen them with above three legs now this epidemical lameness of servants chairs is by philosophers imputed to two causes which are observed to make the greatest revolutions in states and empires i mean love and war a stool a chair or a table is the first weapon taken up in a general romping or skirmish and after a peace the chairs if they be not very strong are apt to suffer in the conduct of an amor the cook being usually fat and heavy and the butler a little in drink  i could never enduce to see maidservants so ungenteel as to walk the streets with their petticoats pinned up it is a foolish excuse to allege theirpetticoats will be dirty when they have so easy a remedy as to walk three or four times down a clean pair of stairs after they come home  when you stop to tattle with some crony servant in the same street leave your own streetdoor open that you may get in without knocking when you come back otherwise your mistress may know you are gone out and you must be chidden  i do most earnestly exhort you all to unanimity and concord but istake me not you may quarrel with each other as much as you please only always bear in mind that you have a common enemy which is your master and lady and you have a common cause to defend believe an old practitioner whoever out of malice to a fellow servants carries a tale to his master shall be ruined by a general confederacy against him  the general place of rendezvous for all the servants both  winter and summer is the kitchen there the grand affairs of the family ought to be consulted whether they concern the stable the dairy the pantry the laundry the cellar the nursery the dining room or my ladys chamber there as in your own proper element you can laugh and squall and romp in full security  when any servant comes home drunk and cannot appear you must all join in telling your master that he is gone to bed sick upon which your lady will be so goodnatured as to order some comfortable thing for the poor man or maid  when your master or lady go abroad together to dinner or on a visit for the evening you need leave only one servant in the house unless you have a blackguard boy to answer at the door and attend the children if there be any who is to stay at home is to be determined by short and long cuts and the stayer at home may be comforted by a visit from a sweetheart without danger of being caught together these opportunities must never be missed because they come but sometimes and all is safe enough while there is a servant in the house  when your master or lady comes home and wants a servant who happens to be abroad your answer must be that he had but just that minute stepped out being sent for by a cousin who was dying  if your master calls you by name and you happen to answer at the fourth call you need not hurry yourself and if you be chidden for staying you may lawfully say you came no sooner because you did not know what you were called for  when you are chidden for a fault as you go out of the room and down stairs mutter loud enough to be plainly heard this will make him believe you are innocent  whoever comes to visit your master or lady when they are abroad never burden your memory with the persons name for indeed you have too many other things to remember besides it is a porters business and your masters fault he does not keep one and who can remember names and you will certainly mistake them and you can neither write nor read  if it be possible never tell a lie to your master or lady unless you have some hopes that they cannot find it out in less than half an hour when a servant is turned off ll his faults must be told although most of them were never own by his master or lady and all mischiefs done by others charge to him instance them and when they ask any of you why you never acquainted them before the answer is sir or madam really i was afraid it would make you angry and besides perhaps you might think it was malice in me where there are little masters and misses in a house they are usually great impediments to the diversions of the servants the only remedy is to bride them with goody goodies that they may not tell tales to papa and mamma  i advise you of the servant whose masters live in the country and who expect vales always to stand rank and file when a stranger is taking his leave so that he must of necessity pass between you and he must have more confidence or less money than usual if any of you let him escape and according as he behaves himself remember to treat him the next time he comes  if you are sent with readymoney to buy any thing at a shop and happen at that time to be out of pocket sink the money and take up the goods on your masters account this is for the honor of your master and yourself for he becomes a man of credit at your recommendation  when your lady sends for you up to her chamber to give you any orders be sure to stand at the door and keep it open fiddling with the lock all the while she is talking to you and keep the button in your hand for fear you should forget to shut the door after you  if your master or lady happen once in their lives to accuse you wrongfully you are a happy servant for you have nothing more to do than for every fault you commit while you are in their service to put them in mind of that false accusation and protest yourself equally innocent in the present case  when you have a mind to leave your master and are too bashful to break the matter for fear of offending him the best way is to grow rude and saucy of a sudden and beyond your usual behavior till he finds it necessary to turn you off and when you are gone to revenge yourself give him and his lady such a character to all your brother servants who are out of place that none will venture to offer their service  some nice ladies who are afraid of catching cold having observed that the maids and fellows belowstairs often forget to shut the door after them as they come in or go out into the backyards have contrived that a pulley and a rope with a large piece of lead at the end should be so fixed as to make the door shut of itself and require a strong hand to open it which is an immense toil to servants whose business may force them to go in and out fifty times in a morning but ingenuity can do much for prudent servants have found out an effectual remedy against this insupportable grievance by tying up the pulley in such a manner that the weight of lead shall have no effect however as to my own part i would rather choose to keep the door always open by laying a heavy stone at the bottom of it  the servants candlesticks are generally broken for nothing can last for ever but you may find out many expedients you may conveniently stick your candle in a bottle or with a lump of butter against the wainscot in a powderhorn or in an old shoe or in a cleftstick or in the barrel of a pistol or upon it is own grease on a table in a coffeecup or a drinking glass a horncann a teapot a twisted napkin a mustardpot an inkhorn a marrowbone a piece of dough or you may cut a hole in the loaf and stick it there  when you invie the neighboring servants to junket with you at home in an evening teach them a peculiar way of tapping or scraping at the kitchenwindow which you may hear but not your master or lady whom you must take care not to disturb or frighten at such unseasonable hours  lay all faults upon a lapdog or favorite cat a monkey a parrot a child or on the servant who was last turned off by this rule you will excuse yourself do no hurt to any body else and save your master or lady from the trouble and vexation of chiding  when you want proper instruments for any work you are about use all expedients you can invent rather than leave your work undone for instance if the poker be out of the way or broken stir the fire with the tongs if the tongs be not at hand use the muzzle of the bellows the wrong end of the fireshovel the handle of the firebrush the end of a mop or your masters cane if you want paper to singe a fowl tear the first book you see about the house wipe your shoes for want of a clout with the bottom of a curtain or a damask napkin strip your liverylace for garters if the butler wants a jordan he may use the great silver cup  there are several ways of putting out candles and you ought to be instructed in them all you may run the candleend against the wainscot which puts the snuff out immediately you may lay it on the ground and tread the snuff out with your foot you may hold it upsidedown until it is choked with it is own grease or cram it into the socket of the candlestick you may whirl it round in your hand till it goes out when you go to bed after you have made water you may dip the candleend into the chamber pot you may spit on your finger and thumb and pinch the snuff till it goes out the cook may run the candles nose into the mealtub or the groom into a vessel of oats or a lock of hay or a heap of litter the housemaid may put out her candle by running it against a lookingglass which nothing cleans so well as candlesnuff but the quickest and best of all methods is to blow it out with your breath which leaves the candle clear and readier to be lighted  there is nothing so pernicious in a family as a telltale against whom it must be the principal business of you all to unite whatever office he serves in take all opportunities to spoil the business he is about and to cross him in every thing for instance if the butler be a telltale break his glasses whenever he leaves the pantrydoor open or lock the cat or the mastiff in it who will do as well or mislay a fork or a spoon so as he may never find it if it be the cook whenever she turns her back throw a lump of soot or a handful of salt in the pot or smoking coals into the drippingpan or daub the roastmeat with the back of the chimney or hide the key of the jack if a footman be suspected let the cook daub the back of his new livery or when he is going up with a dish of soup let her follow him softly with a ladlefull and dribble it all the way up stairs to the dining room and then let the housemaid make such a noise that her lady may hear it the waitingmaid is very likely to be guilty of this fault in hopes to ingratiate herself in this case the laundress must be sure to tear her smocks in the washing and yet wash them but half and when she complains tell all the house that she sweats so much and her flesh is so nasty that she souls a smock more in one hour than the kitchenmaid does in a week  speech of lawyer brief my lords and

from the king louis true gamester will persist and they true courtiers wont resist for now his stubbornness they found each mothers son soon changed his ground and that their sovereign must be right

the comic magazine number ii industry and idleness plate ii the industrious prentice performing the duty of a christian though this print may seem to a cursory observer less striking and important than any of the whole series it is in fact of the very first consequence it is by attending the public worship of the supreme being with becoming piety that virtue is strengthened and it is by the neglect of this duty that vice gains ground of it is victim from this scene tom idle is excluded with him it was no favorite place for during the hours of devotion it will in the next print be seen that he was far differently employed  the industrious youth francis goodchild is in this print represented at spitalfields church assisting in the performance of divine worship and he is honored with the company of miss west his masters daughter in the same pew to whom his features bear a not very distant resemblance they have both a sweet placidity of countenance piety and simplicity are manifest in their deportment and they seem at first sight evidently made for each other  notwithstanding the solemnity of the place hogarth has contrived to give us some ludicrous figures without any violent departure from nature the fat grotesque female in the upper corner the man near her accompanying the organ with his deeptoned vocal exertions and him beneath between sleeping and waking who joins in the sonorous chorus are all though ludicrous such characters as every spectator must recognize the pewopener with her keys is also happily sketched aiding the solemn vociferations  the rules of perspective are in this print purposely violated to give an idea of a crowded congregation but the figures in general are so minute that their merits are imperceptible where they are visible character is to be traced in each  on a slight examination of this print we felt a little inclined to censure hogarth for neglecting to present us with the worthy mr west attending divine worship with his family and thus strengthening the moral effect but we soon discovered that this far from being an error was a merit beyond vulgar view since the absence of the master the better accounts for that of his vicious apprentice  the motto of this print is from the royal psalmist  o how i love they law it is my meditation all the day psalm cxix    the taylors soliloquy by mr harrison to be or not to be  a tailor that is the question shall i who feel myself a man yes every inch a man have but oneninth of my just claim allowed as if it were my bill taxed by too rigid justice who being blind sees not the risque i run forbid it heaven i am a man and a man of consequence too for no man is a man without me even kings would be sans culottes if i turned traitor and refused to make them breeches and who would reverence their bench of judges and their bench of bishops if i did not manusacture furred gowns and lawn sleeves yes law divinity and physic too all stand indebted to me for their importance i am therefore not only a man but a man of importance what would our sailors do those brave fellows to whom we chiefly owe the safety of our country itself without jackets and trowsers why they would be as barebottomed as so many mounseers and then we should see that they had no more bottom neither the soldiers too they would cut a very pretty figure to be sure without me why zounds it is enough to make a man swear but as i am a man  damme i must be a man for no animal on earth but a man ever swears  yes surely as i am a man the very reason that the girls all run to the parade to the parks to every review to the camps and to all places after the soldiers where soldiers are to be seen is because they are so smartly clothed by me what makes soldiers in their eyes look so handsome but the scarlet cloth the buff and the blue in which i dress them the gold lace and the worsted lace the gold epaulets and the worsted epaulets with which i trim the most valiant dogs in the world a tailor then is not only a man but a man of valor since he trims them all at court who would be introduced into the royal presence without my preparing them for a good reception does it signify one farthing what is within provided as how i have the management of the outside in courting too as well as at court are not ninetynine women out of every hundred more governed in their choice by my part of the object than any other consideration whatever a good coat as the old song should say and a light pair of breeches go through the world if a man has no credit with his tailor he has none elsewhere nobody will admit a man of merit out at elbows into his house nobody will speak to genius clothed with rags in the street but let me have the dressing of the vilet rascal in the universe and see if he is not welcomed like a prince in every fashionable circle is it not dress that makes him a gentleman is it not me that regulates the fashions i therefore must be a gentleman as well as a man of fashion can any man who is not well clothed by me cloth the best story in the world so as to be reckoned wit in polite company and will not the most threadbare joke uttered by one whom i have thus qualified convulse the very same circle with laughter i am therefore the maker of wit and must of course be a man of wit shall i then who can do all these great things be cast off and despised like an old garment the instant i quit my shopboard shall i who am not only a man but a man of consequence not only a man of consequence but a man of importance not only a man of importance but a man of valor not only a man of valor but a gentleman not only a gentleman but a man of wit be bawled after by every shabby ragged rascal whenever i fetch a walk with mrs snip my daughter dolly or some favorite girl  look there goes snip the tailor the ninth part of a man and when i mount my nag just to take an airing in the dust of hyde park like my customers see every one turning singerpost and hear them cry twig the tailor riding to brentford while a wag slily contrives to make a slip of paper resembling a measure dangle from my pocket shall i who know so well how to live and how to live well too be thus made weary of my life or even of my livelihood by a set of ragamussios poets and philosophers prate that a bare bodkin will quiet us a bare breech i was going to say it might quiet us but would it quiet the devil he i am told will not be cheated out of his own like a poor tailor by his bad customers and i should choose since i am obliged to give long credit to have as long allowed me as possible they may talk of shuffling off life but i had rather shuffle through life conscience they say makes cowards of us all but a tailor has no conscience ergo a tailor is no coward shall i who am a man of so many functions submit to be thus treated without reply no if they could cut me as small as cabbage put me in the fire like my goose freeze me into the coldness of my favorite cucumbers or send me to hell itself i will speak  while i am a man the world shall hear of my illusage and if i do not experience more respect each mothers son shall be reduced to the primitive figleaf apron  or i will make them all pay swingeingly for every article of dress they get from me and thus in my turn  laugh in my sleeve damme who is afraid  humorous essay on errors of the press originally sent to a morning paper by caleb whitefoord esquire mr editor while you and your correspondents are so laudably employed in watching over the welfare of the state keeping a jealous eye on our ministers and pointing out the errors of government i wish if you could but find time for it that you would pay some little attention to your own errors  perhaps it will appear the highest degree of presumption to offer advice to a person in your eminent station one who every day sundays excepted dictates to ministers and counsels kings one who is read and admired in every part of the british dominions  it is for this very reason sir that i think it incumbent on me to tell you of your mistakes for you cannot say with job albeit that i have erred mine error remains with myself no mr editor your errors circulate far and wide they misrepresent many and mislead more in short the errors i mean are errors of the press or as my learned friend sir james hodges expresses them in one englishlatinsingularplural word erratums  of all errata the most harmless are those which make starkstaring nonsense these are never imputed to the writer but are corrected by the reader in his own mind as he goes along but the dangerous ones are those which make a kind of halfsense and pass current as the sense of the author until the day following when your list of errata transfers the blame from the writer to the printer however i must say that printers with all their professions of candor are as little apt to acknowledge their errors as the rest of mankind for not one erratum in ten is ever acknowledged and indeed i suppose they very seldom would unless at the particular desire of the writer  as i have said much about the errors of the press it may naturally be expected that i should produce some proofs of what i have asserted this i am enabled to do having paid particular attention to them for some time past and having looked more sharply after them than the promotions civil or military the prices of corn or of stocks the list of ships or bankrupts or of those paragraphs which inform who is dead who is married or who is hanged  but now for the particulars of the charge  i have known you throw an injurious reflection on all the crowned heads in europe at one stroke for instead of potentates you have called them potatoes as if they had been mere vegetables as to the king of prussia you talk of him in a different style for instead of the hero of prussia you have made him the nero next day comes your apology or erratum which sometimes instead of mending matters makes things worse and like an archtinker in stopping one hole makes two as i remember my old friend alderman faulkner of dublin corrected an error in his journal erratum in our last for his grace the duchess of dorset read her grace the duke of dorset indeed a blunder seems to be something of the nature of a bog the more you struggle the deeper you get into it but to proceed you have on several occasions used the doge of genoa extremely ill and never have made him the least apology for omitting the last letter in his title though if you had desired your readers next day instead of dog to read doge i do confess that it would have been no great reparation  i remember the irish parliament some time ago were offended at something in your paper and took up the matter so warmly that they ordered the paper to be burnt now whether you mr editor have taken umbrage also and like wise or whether it proceeds from negligence i know not but certain it is that several unlucky mistakes have happened relative to that respectable body at their first meeting you told us instead of a bili that a motion would be made for leave to bringin a bull and afterward another motion that the order of the dey be read as if it was an assembly on the coast of barbary  you told us one day that lord  of the kingdom of ireland had been safely delivered of a daughter and we were all very anxious on my lords account till the day following when you delivered his lordship of the burden and brought the child into the world a more natural way  in a late scuffle under the piazza covent garden you informed us that an irish officer had got a confusion in his head and you made no apology afterward thinking i suppose there was no occasion for any as you were right to a t  not long ago you advertised a speedy cure for raptures and i am afraid it gave some wicked bachelor occasion to scoff at the holy state of matrimony for as the devil would have it i mean one of your devils the very next advertisement to it was from a gentleman who wanted a wife and over it was printed matrimony in capitals consequently it appeared that matrimony was the most speedy and effectual cure for raptures though of ever so long standing etc etc  i have known you advertise instead of a neverfailing remedy an everfailing remedy now sir though this might be strictly true yet i hold it not proper that it should be so set down as i suppose the quackdoctor paid you his money for conveying a very different sense to the public in a receipt lately published for the cure of the plague instead of rue you put rice and so made a pudding of it and in advertising a course of lectures you turned a syllabus into a syllabub and called the perpetual motion a perpetual notion  i wish you would be a little more cautious in advertising salivation not necessary for it happened by omitting the i in salivation you gave great offense to some very good christians in my neigbourhood and also gave occasion to some wicked punsters to observe that it was not the first time an eye had been lost in salivation nay that some people had been so unlucky as to lose a couple  there is another advertisement which frequently occurs beginning with  whereas several evilminded persons etc  one day you made it evilminded parsons which was extremely unlucky for in these times of infidelity people are too apt to scoff at the clergy and indeed at all serious subjects as to myself i must confess that i am particularly hurt at those impertinent levities with which some people indulge themselves being a person of a serious turn of mind and of a disposition rather saturnine and grave  it too often happens mr editor that what should be grave you turn to farce i remember in your paper a sensible pathetick letter signed a citizen he laments the internal state of this country and you made it the infernal state when he exclaimed sad reverse you made him cry our sad reverie he disapproved of all national reflections you made him disapprove of all rational reflections and talking of the fate of empires you made him say the fat of empires now as there are so many standing jokes about citizens being fond of fat  whether turtle fat or venison fat  this unlucky mistake quite spoiled the letter disobliged my friend the citizen and all the fat was in the fire and here i cannot help taking notice of a paragraph some time since containing an account of the election of a a worthy alderman for a certain ward when instead of saying he was duly elected you say he was dully elected and thereby afforded a handle for breaking some commonplace jests on that respectable body of men the court of aldermen another time in the account of an entertainment given by a worthy alderman to the deputy and common council of his ward where they dined on the turtle you said they died on the turtle as if they had all eat till they choked or burst whereas on the contrary it was extremely remarkable that none either overeat themselves or caught a surfeit that day  from several articles mr editor one would be apt to conclude that you were no great geographer for you tell us of corsairs fitted out from turin instead of tunis and that the chinese had revolted against the spaniards instead of the chilese now though these two nations are on different sides of the globe i suppose you thought they were near neighbors being within an ell of each other last year when the russian fleet took the isle of lemnos you told us that part of the squadron remained at the isle of candy and the rest were going to attack the isle of lemons you supposed no doubt that candy was a sugar island and that they were going to the isle of lemons for fruit and so between them to supply the fleet  pro bono publico  with punch  you have sometimes treated the russians very injuriously by calling them russians and one day you told us the combined armies of the turks and tartars instead of a kam was commanded by a ram as if they had been a parcel of sheep and when it was expected the two armies were coming to action you said they were coming to acton and as there was a considerable fall of stocks at that time i have reason to think it was owing to the above report or to some other equally alarming  i trembled for you during the whole time of the congress at fockzany it is a ticklish word in the hands of a careless compositor and one does not know what terrible work he might make of it apropos it is not long since you advertised a view of the canal of venice and you made it the canal of venus and in the account of a housebreaking instead of the rogues broke in at the window you said they broke in at the widow  when you informed us that a certain lady was gone to pass the holiday at her countryseat near corydon every reader supposed that some scandal was meant till the next day when we learned that there was no corydon in the case and that her ladyship was only gone to her countryseat hear croydon  one day you told us that some english lord whose name i have forgot was arrived at naples with his tabor traveling with a tabor seemed to be an odd kind of conceit but his lordship apparement was soud of music though the tabor and pipe seemed more adapted to a lugged bear than a lord on his travels thus we reasoned till the erratum of the next day desired us for tabor to read tutor  if your compositors are bad geographers they are at least as bad arithmeticians wherever sums occur they are sure to make a bad figure i remember at difierent times last year they made the compulsatory india loan   000   0000 and sometimes   000000 in short they have no adequate ideas of figures and as to ciphers they consider them as mere nothings and that adding or taking away two or three of them from a sum makes no difference at all  i have known you turn a matter of bearsay into a matter of heresy damon into a demon a delicious girl into a delirious girl the comic muse into a comic mouse a jewish rabbi into a jewish rabbit and when a correspondent lamenting the corruption of the times exclaimed  o mores you made him cry  o moses  you should consider mr editor that there is a material difference between acting with the utmost lenity and utmost levity between factious and facetious fellow and felon imprudent and impudent resolution and revolution runney mead and running mad loud professions and lewd professions words and works souring and roaring thavies inn and thieves inn minutes and minuets rubies and bubbies a tube and a tub all of which words i have observed you sir at times use indiscriminately  i know you will say that people ought to consider the constant hurry which attends the publication of a daily paper that your paper is in so great request and people are so eager to get it with all it is imperfections on it is head that you really have not time to be more correct ah mr editor it would be well for mankind if reformation like charity were always to begin at home and that people would try to mend themselves instead of bestowing so much fruitless and thankless pains in admonishing their neighbors you sir have bestowed much time and labor and oil floods of ink and reams of paper in advising ministers of state and correcting the measures of government and after all i dare say you yourself will allow that they are at this moment not one bit better or wiser than when you first undertook to mend them  therefore take an old mans advice set a pattern to thy brother editors leave for a while the care of the state to those who are paid for it  look at home begin a reformation there and correct thyself for the example of others i am  thy sincere wellwisher emendator  conjugal affection from the german the tenderhearted araminta loved her husband sincerely for they had been but two months married he constituted her sole felicity their desires and aversions were the same it was aramintas study by diligent attention to anticipate her husbands wishes such a wife says my male reader who entertains thoughts of matrimony such a wife would i desire and such a wife may thou enjoy aramintas husband sell sick of a very dangerous malady no hope said the physician and shook his awful wig bitterly wept araminta  o death might i prefer a petition spare o spare my husband and let me be the victim in his stead death to her astonishment straight appeared and what cried the grim tyrant is thy request  there said araminta trembling with fear and amazement there he lies pierced with intolerable agony he implores thy speedy relief for heavens sake put him instantly out of his misery  curious critique on rousseau with a prophecy found in an old manuscript it has been remarked that a bad book ought as much to be guarded against as a bad companion there certainly is nothing more true and yet the most dangerous are daily published uncensured and a mean ignorant and mercenary or unprincipled publisher may spead poison daily more detrimental than arsenick some books like men acquire great reputation by some brilliant points while the general tendency like the general character is never investigated  in no instance is this more remarkable than in the writings of the celebrated rousseau the annals of literature never exhibited to the world a more paradoxical whimsical ingenious eloquent weak and dangerous author  this authors works have been much read whise few have examined the truth of his pictures or analized the consistency or tendency of his doctrines in the preface to his novel he says  chaste girls never read romances and the girl who reads four pages of this is undone  yet no books are more called for at circulating libraries than romances and none more than his with such sentiments he gives his book to the world and then presumes to write on education  the following fragment which i lately met with said to be sound among some old manuscripts it is believed will convey in a strong and true light what is said of his writings and may perhaps lead some people to think when they read  the prophecy in those days a strange person shall appear in france coming from the borders of a lake and he shall cry to the people  behold i am possessed by the demon of enthusiasm i have received the gift of incoherence i am a philosopher and a professor of paradoxes  and a multitude shall follow him and many shall believe on him  and he shall say to them you are all knaves and fools and your wives and daughters are debauched and i will come and live among you and he shall abuse the natural gentleness of the people by his foul speeches  and he shall cry aloud all men are virtuous in the country where i was born but i will not live in the country where i was born  and he shall maintain that arts and sciences necessarily corrupt the manners and he shall write on all arts and sciences  and he shall declare the theater a source of prostitution and corruption and he shall write operas and comedies  and he shall affirm savages only are virtuous though he has never lived among savages but he shall be worthy to live among them  and he shall say to men cast away your fine garments and go naked and he himself shall wear laced clothes when they are given him  and he shall say to the great they are more despicable than their fortunes but he shall frequent their houses and they shall behold him as a curious animal brought from a strange land  and his occupation shall be to copy french music and he shall say there is no french music  and he shall declare romances destructive to morality and he shall write a romance and in his romance the words shall be virtuous and the morals wicked and his characters shall be outrageous lovers and philosophers  and he shall say to the universe i am a favorite of fortune i write and receive love letters and the universe shall s the letters he received were written by himself  and in his romance he shall reach the art of suborning a maiden by philosophy and she shall learn from her lover to forget shame and become ridiculous and write maxims  and she shall give her lover the first kiss upon his lips and shall invite him to lie with her and he shall lie with her and she shall become big with metaphysics and her billetdoux shall be homilies of philosophy  and he shall teach her that parents have no authority in the choice of a husband and he shall paint them barbarous and unnatural  and he shall refuse wages from the father because of the delicacy natural to men and receive money underhand from the daughter which he shall prove to be exceedingly proper  and he shall get drank with an english lord who shall insult him and he shall propose to fight with the english lord and his mistress who a lost the honor of her own sex shall decide upon that of men and she shall teach him who taught her every thing that he ought not to fight  and he shall receive a persion from the lord and shall go to paris where he shall not frequent the society of wellbred and sensible people but of flirts and petitmaities and he shall believe he has seen paris  and he shall write to his mistress that the women are grenadiers go naked and refuse nothing to any man they chance to meet  and when the same women shall receive him at their countryhouses and amuse themselves with his vanity he shall say they are prodigies of reason and virtue  and the petitmaitres shall bring him to a brothel and he shall get drunk like a fool and lie with strange women and write an account of all this to his mistress and she shall thank him  and he shall receive his mistresss picture and his imagination shall kindle at the sight and his mistress shall give him obscene ssons on solitary chastity  and this mistress shall marry the first man that arrives from the worlds end and notwithstanding all her craft she shall imagine no means to break off the match and she shall pass intrepidly from her lovers to her husbands arms  and her husband shall know before his marriage that she is desperately in love with and beloved by another man and he shall voluntarily make them miserable but he shall be a good man and moreover an atheist  and his wife shall immediately find herself exceedingly happy and shall write to her lover that were she still free she would prefer her husband to him  and the philosophic lover shall resolve to kill himself  and he shall write a long dissertation to prove that a man ought to kill himself when he has lost his mistress and his friend shall prove the thing not worth the trouble and the philosopher shall not kill himself  and he shall make the tour of the globe to give his mistresss children time to grow that he may return to be their preceptor and teach them virtue as he taught their mother  and the philosopher shall see nothing in his tour round the globe  and he shall return to europe  and the husband of his mistress though acquainted with their whole intrigue shall bring his good friend to his house  and the virtuous wife shall leap upon his neek at his entrance and the husband shall be charmed and they shall all three embrace every day and the husband shall be jocose upon their adventures and shall believe they are become reasonable and they shall continue to love with ecstasy and shall delight to remember their voluptuousness and they shall walk hand in hand and weep  and the philosopher being in a boat with his mistress alone shall be inclined to throw her overboard and jump after her  and they shall call all this virtue and philosophy  and while they talk of virtue and philosophy no one shall be able to comprehend what is either virtue or philosophy  and they shall prove virtue no longer to consist in the fear of temptation but in the pleasure of being continually exposed to it and philosophy shall be the art of making vice amiable  and the philosophers mistress shall have a few trees and a stream in her garden and she shall call her gardens elysium and no one shall be able to comprehend her  and she shall feed the wanton sparrows in her elysium and she shall watch her domestic male and female lest they should be as amorous as herself  and she shall sup with her daylabourers and hold them in great respect and shall beat hemp with her philosopher at her side  and her philosopher will determine to beat hemp the next day the day after and every day of his life  and the laborers shall sing and the philosopher shall be enchanted by their melodies although not italian  and she shall educate her children with great care and shall not let them speak

they shall not care what is become of the lover  and the whole romance shall be useful good and moral for it shall prove that daughters have a right to dispose of their hearts hands and favors without consulting parents or regarding the inequality of conditions  and it shall show that while you talk of virtue it is useless to practice it  and that it is the duty of a young girl to go to bed to one man and marry another  and that it is sufficient for those who deliver themselves up to vice to feel a temporary remorse for virtue  and that a husband ought to open his doors and his arms to his wifes lover  and that the wife ought to have him for ever in her arms and take in good part the husbands jokes and the lovers whims  and she ought to prove or believe she has proved that love between

wounds to show the power of their specificks he shall poison souls that he may have the glory of curing them and the poison shall act violently on the mind and on the heart but the antidote shall act on the mind only and the poison shall prevail  and he shall vaunt that he has dug a pit and think himself free from reproach by saying woe be to the young girls that fall into my pit i have warned them of it in my preface and young girls never read prefaces  and when in his romance he shall have mutually degraded philosophy by manners and manners by philosophy he shall say a corrupt people must have romances  and he shall also say a corrupt people must have rogues  and he shall leave the world to draw the conclusion  and he shall add to justify himself for having written a book where vice predominates that he lived in an age when it was impossible to be good  and to excuse himself he shall calumniate all mankind  and he shall threaten to despise all those who do not believe in his book  and virtuous people shall consider his folly with an eye of pity  and he shall no longer be called a philosopher but the most eloquent of all the sophists  and they shall wonder how a pure mind could conceive such an impure book  and those who believed in him shall believe in him no more  humorous anecdote of hogarth and a nobleman in the early part of hogarths life a nobleman who was uncommonly ugly and deformed came to fit to him for his picture it was executed with a skill that did honor to the artists abilities but the likeness was rigidly observed without even the necessary attention to compliment or flattery the peer disgusted at this counterpart of his dear self never once thought of paying for a reflector that would only insult him with his deformities some time was suffered to elapse before the artist applied for his money but afterward many applications were made by him who had then no need of a banker for payment without success the painter however at last hit upon an expedient which he knew must alarm the noblemans pride and by that means answer his purpose it was couched in the following card   mr hogarths dutiful respects to lord  finding that he does not mean to have the picture which was drawn for him is informed again of mr hogarths necessity for the money if therefore his lordship does not send for it in three days it will be disposed of with the addition of a tail and some other little appendages to mr hare the famous wildbeast man mr hogarth having given that gentleman a conditional promise of it for an exhibition of pictures on his lordships refusal  this intimation had the desired effect the picture was sent for home and committed to the flames  account of a most aweful change in a young lady of eighteen addressed to a friend my dear friend i shall rouse your tenderest feelings when i inform you that you will no more behold the lovely and beloved miss singlehand she departed her state of trial on sunday last in the eighteenth year of her age  that which brought her to her present situation has long preyed on her vitals on the day just mentioned the conqueror came with irresistible authority as a king of terrors indeed but in his mildest form and laid his victorious hand on her about ten oclock in the morning from which time till night she held a state of uncertain existence at last about midnight that amiable countenance which used to glow with sweet modesty was shrouded in darkness and the spoiler triumphed over beauties which were once the desire or the envy of both sexes  the first attack of her disorder was at a review in the park where colonel scarlet whose manly and polite address is so well known commanded the regiment near which she stood a sweetlypainful palpitation on a sudden seized her till then peaceful bosom but this gave her little alarm ignorant as she was of the nature of her malady and by no means expecting the consequences which it has now produced when she came home she felt anxiety and restlessness yet it did not appear that she had caught cold she was fond of solitude and apt to tremble and change color she complained but that only when alone of an uneasiness in her breast was observed to lean her cheek on her hand and frequently to wipe the trickling tear which accompanied the involuntary halfbroken sigh  some of her friends were apprehensive for her senses and indeed several of her actions appeared destitute of that prudence goodsense and gaiety for which she was before remarkable to study long at her lookingglass to be angry with her headdress to talk to herself like one delirious of groves and fountains soldiers parents and wrinkled old age with a thousand other incoherent subjects were circumstances very suspicious indeed but whatever her disorder was she was very shy of giving any intimation which might lead to a discovery of it  it is proper you should know that colonel scarlet was by this time pretty intimate at her fathers and from him was learned what chiefly led her friends to a knowledge of her complaint they endeavored to administer such remedies as were calculated to remove her disease but in vain it evidently increased a jaunt into the country a round of elegant amusements solitude or company seemed each to feed her complaint rather than remove it the attention of the colonel to her situation at this time was exceedingly diligent and tender be professed the utmost concern for her welfare and interested himself in all that was done for her his countryfeat his coach and his fortune were all at her service and he seemed willing to give even himself for her happiness  in this situation of things and as the last resource  all other advice proving ineffectual  recourse was had to a clergyman he spoke to her very seriously concerning the change of state before her enquired into the situation of her mind with respect to the approaching awful period informed her of the new birth to be expected the remedy against sin and the society and comfort of the blissful mansions quoting several texts to the purpose he gave her many suitable exhortations to love her lord with all her heart and obey his will and directed her concerning the endowment of wordly goods and such other subjects as are common on these occasions during all which exhortations she seemed in great agitation and made answer with a faltering tongue hope and tear shame joy and trembling apprehension alternately possessing her breast  her father gave her up with great composure but her mother not without many tears the colonel who was present and much interested in all that passed gave her several tokens of his high esteem and good wishes which she accepted with downcast eyes and a scarcely audible voice the spectators seemed to think her exceedingly well prepared and whispered to each other about her uprightness faith virtue constancy and a thousand other amiable qualifications for a state of happiness  when this scene was over she appeared somewhat more composed and tasted a little and but a little refreshment she seemed to have forebodings of her fate and expected that night to commence her state of lasting misery or bliss  some of her young female acquaintance helped her to undress and endeavored to console her they told her that it was what they must all come to that they doubted not she would be happy and sympathetically wished that their time was also come this afforded but little allay to her anxious expectation she expressed great backwardness to depart and trembled to think what torments she might ere long endure then turning her thoughts to the brighter scenes she expressed her hope that however sharp the struggles of nature might be she should nevertheless experience all beyond them to be delight and joy taking therefore an affectionate farewell of her young companions she composed herself to meet her destiny and with a groan was received into the bosom of her lord  loveletter from an officer in the army to a widow whom he had never seen though i never madam had the happiness to see you  no not so much as in a picture  and consequently can no more tell what complexion you are of than one who lives in the remotest parts of china i am nevertheless most passionately in love with you and this affection has taken such deep root in my heart that on my conscience i could die a martyr for you with as much cheerfulness as thousands have done for their religion who were as ignorant of the truth for which they died as i am of your ladyship  this declaration madam may surprise you but you will cease to wonder when i have acquainted you what it was that not only gave birth to my passion but has effectually confirmed it last week having occasion to ride into surry about some particular business i noticed not far from the road a most magnificent seat my curiosity was instantaneously raised to know the owner of so beautiful a pile and being informed that it belongs to your ladyship i began that very moment to have a very strong inclination for you when therefore i was farther assured that some two thousand acres of the best ground in england appertained to this noble fabric together with a fine park delightful gardens variety of fish ponds and other desirable conveniences i then fell up to the ears in love and resolved to enlist myself among the number of your humble servants and sincere admirers  the owner of so many fine things said i to myself must needs be the finest women in the world what though she be old  her trees are green what though she may have lost the lilies and the roses in her cheeks  she has enough left in her gardens what though she should be barren  her fields are sufficiently fruitful  with these thoughts in my head i alighted from my horse and at once became so enamoured of your ladyship that i told my passion to every tree in your park and by the bye they are the tallest straightest loveliest finest shapedtrees i ever beheld in my life  i now appeal to your ladyship whether any lover was ever influenced by more solid motives than your devoted humble servant those who are wholly captivated by beauty will infallibly find their passion decay with the transitory charm which at first attracted their regard and those who pretend to admire a woman merely for the qualities of her mind must consider her soul as abstracted from her body but he who loves not a woman in the flesh as well as in the spirit is only fit in my opinion to make love to a spectre whereas my passion the sincerity of which you cannot possibly doubt is built on the same foundation with your house grows with your trees and will daily increase with your estate  for any thing i know to the contrary you may be the handsomest woman in the kingdom but whether you are so or not signifies little while you have fortune enough to six my affection i am a soldier my profession and as i have fought for pay by heavens blessing i mean to love for money  all your other suitors would speak the same language if they were equally honest and should you favor this blunt address by making choice of me i can add for your comfort that you will be the first woman on record from the creation to the present hour who ever loved a man for telling her the truth  the widows answer though sir i have never had the satisfaction of seeing you and my fancy cannot possibly form an idea of your person from the ingenuous frankness of your epistle and the matchless impudence of your address i am equally inclined to love and to despise you that you could die a martyr for me with as much cheerfulness as thousands have done for their religion i can by no means believe for in the next world i have neither a house nor a tree that i can call my own and were such a tragicomical event to take place i much question whether i should have the smallest reason to wish it otherwise this declaration sir may surprise you but you will cease to wonder when i tell you that i have no very favorable opinion of a soldier my last husband was an officer in the army young handsome intelligent and blessed with every requisite save one to render me perfectly happy  save one you will reply what could that be  constancy sir the basis of felicity in a conjugal state he loved the women indiscriminately me apparently more than the rest because it was more to his interest my personal property became his the moment we were married but my real estate with which you are so much enamoured he could not touch without my consent this kept him in good humor for he well knew that if he displeased me i should at my decease bequeath the whole to a poor relation and leave him the pill of disappointment to carry off the dregs of insolence thus happily fortified against the tyranny of his natural disposition i lived in tolerable ease with him for the space of three years when a lingering intermittent brought on a consumption which soon closed the career of his life and made me an inheritor of liberty at large this sudden reversion of my fate from subjection to freedom was the grand desideratum of my wishes and as i have known a deprivation of liberty i shall now set the higher value on that inestimable blessing instead therefore of giving you the encouragement you solicit i must tell you frankly that having known the joys of matrimony as well as it is inconveniences i am not inclined to purchase a moments pleasure with an age of pain i am now my own mistress subject to no control and above the censure of the impertinent whatever may be your opinion of me after the perusal of this letter be assured it is not in your power however specious your arguments or captivating your person may be to disturb for one moment the tranquillity of her who having known the duplicity and inconstancy of one will never entrust to another that happiness which she now finds in her own bosom i am sir with as much sincerity your lover as i wish you to be mine  sir simon and hodge or the additional wrinkle by mr harrison as hodge one day was sweltring in the sun a dry old dog yet a true child of fun sir simon came to see his man so blithe panting beneath the labor of his scythe for hodge had risen ere the early dawn twas now high noon nor yet clean shaved the lawn much had he done which he was pleased to view but cursed the little that remained to do his arms were weary and his aged back seemed every sinew at each bend to crack at every stroke the drops of sweat fast pace down the rough furrows of his timeploughd face and still he stops though he can scarcely stand to sweep his dewy forehead with his hand with frequent rubbings whets his lingering blade and sighs for evening and the freshning shade now old sir simon was as queer a soul as hodge himself but nothing like so droll he had some wit and thought that he had more as many a greater wit has done before and many another we may well maintain has done so since and will do so again hodge says sir simon you cannot well be dry for you are wet enough i see to fry now had you been but dry enough to burn a jug of ale had done you no illturn hodge smiled at very mention of the nappy but at the sight was wondrously more happy for now sir simon having had his joke drew the full pitcher from beneath his cloak hodge seized with eager hand the foaming prize and heavnward raising both his grateful eyes fast down his throat the welcome liquor pours nor heeds his master loudly though he roars  stop hodge why hodge zounds hodge why dont you stop i am thirsty too zounds hodge leave me a drop sir simon bawled as loud as he could bawl but hodge never stopped till he had swallowed all as flowly now he panting gains his breath that seemed awhile oermatchd by struggling death  hodge says sir simon prythee can not hear why zounds i bade thee not drink all the beer deuce take thy throat mine is hoarse with so much bawl i have half a mind to ram down jug and all i told thee i was dry as well as thee but not a drop plague take thee s left for me hodge now affected wonderful surprise and like a pigs just stuck appeared his eyes  lord sir says hodge seemingly vast contrite though bent by trick to pacify the knight  ise be main sorry thus to give offense but to a person of your worships sense ise need not say for that would be absurd while a man drinks he never can hear one word  not hear while drinking straight sir simon cries filled in his turn with a stuck pigs surprise why sure  why sure hodge  that can never be egad i will fetch another jug and see away the knight with his best speed then went to find the truth as told by hodge intent and hodge mean time contrived the means to make sir simon what he said for gospel take now hodge the knight returning cried well try if what you tell me truth be or a lie i will drink and you must bellow  stop stop stop do pray sir you may add leave me a drop this when i hear i certainly will do so as i drink remember hodge bawl you sir simon heaved the pitcher to his head hodge opened his mouth but not a word he said yet gaped so wide there seemed abundant fear the fellow meant to tear from ear to ear this truth so strange to hodge sir simon cried i never would have believed had i not tried thus hodge it is though life wears fast away wiser and wiser we grow every day this time thou had i fairly own most brains so freely take the liquor for thy pains hodge thus got paid for playing off his wit and pleased his master was though he was bit convined that he had gained a wrinkle more no matter where  than ever he had before the razorgrinder a comic tale by peter pikdar esquire a fellow in a market fown most musical cried razors up and down and offered twelve for eighteen pence which certainly seemed wondrous cheap and for the money quite a heap as every man would buy with cash and sense a country bumpkin the great offer heard poor hodge who suffered by a broad black beard that seemed a shoebrush stuck beneath his nose with cheerfulness the eighteenpence he paid and proudly to himself in whispers said  this rascal stole the razors i suppose no matter if the fellow he a knave provided that the razors shave it certainly will be a monstrous prize so home the clown with his good fortune went smiling in heart and soul content and quickly soapd himself to ears and eyes being well latherd from a dish or tub hodge now began with grinning pain to grub just like a hedger cutting furze twas a vile razor  then the rest he tried  all were impostors  ah hodge sighed i wish my eighteenpence within my purse in vain to chase his beard and bring the graces he cut and dug and wincd and stamped and swore brought blood and danced blasphemed and made wry faces and cursed each razors body over and over his muzzle formed of opposition stuff firm as a foxite would not lose it is rough so kept it  laughing at the steel and suds hodge in a passion stretched his angry jaws vowing the direst vengeance with clenchd claws on the vile cheat that sold the goods razors a damned confounded dog not fit to scrape a hog hodge sought the fellow  sound him and begun  prhaps master razorrogue to you it is fun that people flea themselves out of their lives you rascal for an hour i have been grubbing giving my scoundrel whiskers here a scrubbing with razors just like oyster knives sirrah i tell you youre a knave to cry up razors that cannot shave friend quoth the razorman i am no knave as for the razors you have bought upon my soul i never thought that they would shave not think they would shave quoth hodge

this admirable print a fine contrast is afforded to the preceding one here while the virtuous and industrious youth is performing the duty of a pious christian his indolent and vicious fellowapprentice lies stretched on a tombstone and gambling with the vilest associates they are playing at hustlecap and tom idle is in the act of cheating by a concealment of some of the half pence under the broad brim of his hat  a shoeblack distinguished by his stool basket and brushes challenges the fraud and their prosligate companion with a black patch over his eye is resolutely insisting on fair play  so deeply are they engaged in the dispute that the beadle summoned by the noise of their quarrel approaches unperceived to chastise them with his cane the first intimation of the beadles presence is obviously signified by a smart application of the rattan on the culprits back  that the filthiest and most slothful wretches are under the necessity of continually employing their hands however reluctantly is manifest in the active search of the shoeblack beneath his rags as well as the similar diligence of the lad with his hat scratched more than half off his head who are both

at fulllength  the skulls and other bones near the open grave are not only characteristick of the scene but serve to increase as it were the turpitude of the offenders by displaying their hardened and abominable insensibility to objects which cannot be surveyed without a degree of aweful horror by all who possess the common feelings of humanity  the fatality of associating with such miscreants will be abundantly demonstrated in the succeeding series where the fellow with a black patch over one eye first encountered at a sort of gamingtable in a churchyard leads tom idle a not unwilling votary into the depths of iniquity and then like the archbetrayer of mankind completely abandons him  the motto is literally appropriate to the scene   judgments are prepared for scorners and stripes for the back of fools proverbs xix    professional speeches at a bruising match by mr harrison as i was a few days ago crossing moorfields i perceived a large crowd of people gathered together making a noise to the full as confused and generally speaking to the full as unintelligible as could possibly be heard at the famous building of the tower of babel  i am naturally averse to such assemblies but as i was at a loss to know with certainty from what cause it originated curiosity prompted me to visit the scene of action where i beheld one of the most stubborn battles between a coalheaver and a carman that perhaps ever was seen at the trifling expense of a tolerable handkerchief and an old memorandumbook of no use to any one but the rightowner  what struck me most forcibly during this conflict was the jargon which flew about on the occasion and in which as the company probably consisted of almost every different species of artificers and laborers i thought i could discover striking traits of their respective professions  if the reader possesses himself of the same idea he may probably peruse the following minutes of such parts of the colloquy as i could distinguish with a satisfaction nearly equal to that which i myself felt  sailor smite my eyes jack why dont you get to windward splice me if i wouldnt soon knock out the lubbers starboardeye box his compass run in under his guns

remembrance of most readers  with respect to the event of the battle it is only necessary to observe that after the combatants had bruised each other till neither of them was able to see or stand it was agreed that a final decision of their dispute should be deferred till another opportunity in the mean time i found that the contest was of a very important nature being intended to decide no less a question than whether a coalheaver or a carman was the most respectable profession   address to the good people of england and really a good sort of people ye are when ye are pleased the task is not difficult to bring ye into goodhumour neither but i defy all the artists in europe to keep you so  ye love to find fault nay to make faults and if you cannot quarrel with your neighbors you will fall out with yourselves like the greyhound who used to grow angry at his own tail  you may say that i am guilty of injustice and that ye are affable humane friendly charitable social sweettempered selfdenying beings if every person was to draw his own picture the penandink portrait would appear so but i who have looked upon life for above twenty years as an unconcerned spectator of all the fantasticalness with which mankind have fatigued themselves  to me ye appear selfish stubborn querulous conceited discontented existences and ever enjoy more than ye deserve yet are daily wishing for more enjoyments and to do less to deserve them  i dined yesterday at mr fineers and his eldest son being introduced according to the ancient family custom of showing the visitors how much wit the heir has one of the guests addressed his papa with  i suppose sir you will bring master up to your business  bring him up to be a hangman rather was the parents answer no no he shall never be brought up to work all his lifetime for nothing as i have done and yet this person has gained by his own industry and success in trade upwards of four thousand pounds but thus it is we covet to enjoy still more than we do and want still to do less for it  epictetus says mankind are dissatisfied senecca says they are discontented and this is what both before and since seneca every person has been saying who could say any thing  with your leave good people i shall present you with a couple of characters as it is common for those who suppose themselves to be artists to exhibit specimens of their performances i offer these with submission and tell me if you please how you like them  they are sketches of a farmer and a hopplanter  in the harvest season that particular month of providences bounty when all the animal creation appears cheerfully industrious and we may even fancy approaching winter to bear a smile on his weatherworn wrinkles when he views the store that is gathering in to comfort him while he visits us yet even then congratulate the farmer on the noble prospect of his wellcovered acres he will shake his head and between a sigh and a grunt he will answer you with  ah but the straw is short  if the straw is long then he will tell you there is no substance in the grain  if there is but an indifferent crop he laments that it will not pay the expense of housing and threshing  if a plentiful crop then he grumbles corn will be so cheap it will not be worth carrying to market  just so the hopplanter he rises lifts up the sash and looks over the horizon if the morning happens to be cloudy he pulls down the window with an oath saying  it will rain today and all the blossoms will be washed off  if there should be a pleasant air abroad then the poles will be all blown down  if the sun shines o lord the plants will be burned up  if it is a close dry day without much sunshine or wind then he wishes for rain to destroy the vermin or else they will eat all the buds up  the reader who neither owns hopgrounds nor rents cornlands will wonder how these persons can be so discontented yet it is an even bett that those who seem to be amazed at such grumblers are as dissatisfied themselves the symptoms of the distemper may be different but the disease is the same in almost all  half the cure is supposed to be performed when the physician knows the patients disorder indeed my good people neighbors countrymen and choice spirits i do know bona fide that you are disordered and know that you disorder is nay would prescribe for you but imagine my medicines will be thrown away  suppose i order you a few grains of selfknowledge half a dram of patience and a scruple of selfdenial mixed up with a teaspoonful of the syrup of humanity will any of you take such an electuary ye might taste it indeed for the noveltys sake but i will bett a handful of integrity against all court ceremonies that ye spit it out again  folly has thrown your heads into hystericks and i will say opinion against commonsense which are the greatest odds that can be offered not one man in many dozens knows what is the matter with himself  last week i called on an old acquaintance his lady told me her spouse was disturbed and disordered at something she could not tell for what and that she was happy at my calling because she hoped i would get him into spirits again  i went to him into his study there he sat discontented as an undone gamester i took him by the hand and enquired if he was ill he replied that thank god he enjoyed as good a state of health as any man in the world i desired to know if his affairs were any way complicated which might make him uneasy his reply was  sir i do not owe any person a shilling and my income greatly exceeds my outsets  i hope sir no words have happened betwixt your lady and you  there is not a better woman breathing sir and we live in continued harmony  how does your daughter sir  married sir and as happy as i am  your son at college  my son sir contributes to my happiness i hear every body praise him  what then sir can you be uneasy about  see there sir my friend replied raising his voice at the same time and pulling some printed papers out of his pocket there sir read there there is the gazetteer and the general and the ledger and the herald and the chronicle and the morning post who can enjoy themselves when we read such terrible accounts as they give us not only of the government but also of themselves mercy upon us but we are a boughtandsold nation  with some difficulty i persuaded him to come into company again and once more be himself and leave the study of politics alone to those who loved to be imposed on  i told him all that a man of sense ought to do was to conform to the laws of god and his country to take things as they were use them as they should be act with as much integrity to mankind as the customs of the world would suffer and independent and contented enjoy the pleasures of domestic society and wait with patience for that awful that allinteresting event when empire breaks his scepter and beauty ceases to be amiable when faction is dissipated the phantom of pride vanished and all the worldly distinctions are buried in a deathbed dissolution  character of a hare esquire a very extraordinary country gentleman permit this letter to inform you that there is coming up to town by the norwich coach one who has lived most part of his time in our neighborhood if indeed he is not a native of this county but of that i cannot be positive neither is it very material as i can notwithstanding give you a sufficient account of him for your conduct respecting the reception and treatment which it will be proper to give him having furnished him  for he never was in town before  with a direction to your house his conduct in time past has been though not totally irreprehensible as innocent at least as that of most others some few complaints i have heard of his depredations in the gardens if not in the orchards of his neighbors but yet they have been ready to acknowledge at the same time they believe he thought no harm it is true he was rather wild in his youth but never extravagant or gay in dress living wholly in the country he has no notion of the amusements of the town but being remarkably light of foot has not been able entirely to absent himself from field diversions nor yet has he indulged himself in them upon such occasions he has been much sought and when he has been only just seen or as it were had in view it is surprising how the rest of the company have exulted and much has been in the words of the poet on other joyous occasions the clamor of men of boys and dogs but though every body else has appeared highly delighted i have reason to believe he never enjoyed peace of mind at such riotous doings for he has always endeavored to leave them as soon as he could and sometimes he has stolen away and left them at a fault for want of his company but how forcible is unprofitable company at other times a more select party have compelled him to take the lead and go greater lengths than he approved which has still been attended with uneasiness of mind and frequently has he been turned but lately on an occasion of that sort he received so severe a check in the midst of his career that it entirely put a stop to his progress in that way and to tell you the truth is the cause of his leaving the country at this time though much altered in that respect i believe he is still what may be called harebrained which i suppose you will discover before he has been long in your company unaccustomed to being frequently in much company as well as naturally timid and shy even in the country it is not to be expected he will ever be capable of entertaining a very large company but a few select friends i believe will be very well satisfied with what they can obtain from him or pick out of him and let me tell you however unlikely it may seem he will bear a roasting as well as most only take this information along with you as he is a mere rustic and has indulged his appetite in the country without scruple though with strict temperance it may not be amiss to fill his belly with pudding and perhaps a glass of wine may not be illbestowed before you try that experiment upon him of the family of the hares you have doubtless heard i have some notion one of them attained to considerable dignity in the national church but the subject of this letter though of the same name is not of that family but of one more ancient nor did ever one of these profess with them not but that i lately read an account in the newspapers of one of this family who went to a place of public worship in time of service but i believe with no more devotion than some others whom i have heard called thorough churchmen from their going as it is most likely he did in at one door and out at the other though this family cannot boast of places or pensions from the court they have not been totally disregarded by the legislature the nobility and gentry having put it out of the power as far as acts of parliament with united associations to enforce them can do it of the small vulgar to exercise their merciless tempers upon them as they were too apt to do if they could only extort from them a meals meat by it and sometimes merely for the diversion of following them from place to place and yet i believe if they were to speak all the truth we should find themselves more frequently injured and more wantonly persecuted by their professed protectors than any other men and may i not add perhaps they are not alone in that predicament but as this letter is not intended to be a vehicle for political or disaffected reflections on men and measures i shall conclude with wishing the subject of it may arrive safe at your house and give your wife and yourself as much satisfaction as it gives me pleasure to have such an opportunity of subscribing myself  your affectionate friend rigdum funnidos  specimen of beau nashs manner of telling a story i will tell you something to that purpose  that i fancy will make you laugh a covetous old parson as rich as the devil scraped a fresh acquaintance with me several years ago at bath i knew him when he and i were students at oxford where we both studied damnationly hard but that is neither here nor there well very well i entertained him at my house in johns court  no my house in johns court was not built then  but i entertained him with all that the city could afford the rooms the music and every thing in the world on his leaving bath he pressed me very bard to return the visit and desired me to let him have the pleasure of seeing me at his house in devonshire about six months after i happened to be in that neighborhood and was resolved to see my old friend from whom i expected a very warm reception well i knocks at his door when an old queer creature of a maid came to the door and denied him i suspected however that he was at home and going into the parlour what should i see but the parsons legs up the chimney where he had thrust himself to avoid entertaining me this was very well my dear says i to the maid it is very cold extreme cold indeed and i am afraid i have got a touch of my ague light me the fire if you please  la sir says the maid who was a modest creature to be sure the chimney smokes monstrously you would not bear the room for three minutes together by the greatest good luck there was a bundle of straw on the hearth and i called for a candle the candle came well good woman says i since you will not light me a fire i will light one for myself and in a moment the straw was all in a blaze this quickly unkennelled the old fox there he stood in an old rusty nightgown blessing himself and looking like  a  hem  egad  here i stand gentlemen who could once leap fortytwo feet upon level ground at three standingjumps backward or forward one two

persian story translated from the french a king of persia who was in the sixtythird year of his age grew so doting fond of one of his concubines a fair circassian named roxana that he obliged himself by a solemn oath never to refuse her any thing she should request of him the lady made her advantage of this monarchs weakness and every day by some new and extravagant demand took occasion to gratify her ambition her avarice or her revenge during the career of her power a certain european merchant who had sold her some jewels in order to engage her interest and protection at court made her a present of a beautiful little dog which had been taught to dance and play a thousand antic tricks in a short time roxana became as fond of her dog as the king was of her only she lamented that the little creature was not endowed with speech and could not therefore make a proper reply to those endearing expressions she used as often as she caressed him one of her eunuchs then present told her she need not grieve on this account for he knew a philosopher named hali then living in the suburbs of ispahan who could teach her dog to speak the persian language as articulately as he spoke it himself that he had learned this art from a grecian sage who had not only given speech to dogs and other animals of his country but had rendered them as learned and knowing as those great men among the ancients who had been bred in the schools of athens hali was immediately sent for made acquainted with this business and required to attend the next morning to give the dog his first lesson it was in vain for the poor man to remonstrate against the possibility of such an undertaking he was answered it was the kings command and must not be disputed that if he performed what was enjoined him in the space of thirty days he should be amply rewarded if he failed he should lose his head  hali we may imagine considered the kings command as the artifice of his enemies and as a trap which they had laid for his life he communicated his distress to his eldest son a youth of nineteen who had a ready wit and excellent parts which had been well cultivated and improved by his wise fathers instructions he had besides a most engaging manner of address a great sweetness of temper and a beautiful person mirza  for that was the young mans name  burst into tears when he heard the kings orders but immediately recovering himself he told his father that he had thought of a certain method to divert the danger which threatened their family  for this purpose he desired hali to present him the next morning to the chief eunuch as his daughter and as a person well instructed in her fathers art and who would engage at the hazard of her own life as well as his to execute the kings injunction and thereby merit his grace and favor hali looked upon his son with amazement and persuading himself that he spoke by the inspiration of the prophet who had taken their house under his protection he made no difficulty of complying with young mirzas request  accordingly next morning mirza disguised in a virgins habit was conducted to the chief eunuch and by him led into roxanas apartment where he performed his part so well that before the month expired it was reported all over the seraglio that the philosophers daughter had taught the little dog not only to speak but to speak like a wise man and answer pertinently to every question the king would needs be assured of the truth of this prodigy he made a visit to his favorite she confirmed the report and the dog being presented to him was commanded to give a proof of his exraordinary talents by answering respectfully whatever the king should be pleased to ask him  the monarch seated himself on a sopha and taking the dog in his arms gently stroked his head  and he stroked it and she stroked it and she stroked it and he stroked it i have translated this parenthesis word for word it seems to have some allegical sense which i do not comprehend the gentlemen who are lened in the doctrine of inendoes may probably discover the authors meaning   and then he proposed this question say thou pretty animal who am i after a short silence roxana entreated the king to tell her if he was not highly delighted with the answer which the little beast had made him and whether he could ever have believed the thing if he had not heard it the king protested he had not heard a word at which roxana seemed much concerned and looking earnestly in the kings face demanded again if his majesty had not heard the dog answer him in the words following  you are the son of the sun the lieutenant of the prophets and the king of kings you are dreaded by your enemies adored by your subjects and passionately beloved by my fair mistress  the king of persia rose up amazed and confounded but still insisting he did not hear the dog speak roxana lifted up her hands and thus addressed herself to mahomet  thou messenger of god protect and defend the king increase his honor lengthen his life preserve his understanding and open his ears and o never  never let him feel the infirmities of old age then the dog being ordered to speak a little louder she begged the king to make a second trial which he did with great success for he now declared he heard the little creature distinctly utter every word just as roxana had before repeated  this occasioned an universal joy in the seraglio nothing was talked of for some days but the speaking dog his answer to the king was written in letters of gold and preserved in the archives of the empire the pretended daughter of hali was dismissed with a noble reward and her father was soon afterward promoted to one of the best governments in persia  the author of this tale concludes it with the following reflection  old age very seldom proves a blessing to great men especially to these who have any share in the government of the world the persian monarch who ruled so many nations and esteemed himself a favorite of the gods and the first man in the universe was not permitted the use of his eyes or his ears he was the dupe of his slave and the jest of his whole court but no one durst tell him so and he died without knowing it  the rival orators one sunday during last summer while the weather was extremely hot the windows of a certain parish church in the diocese of gloucester were set open to admit more air while the congregation was assembled for divine service just as the clergyman was beginning his weekly discourse  who by the bye is not much celebrated for his oratorial powers  a jackass which had been grazing in the churchyard popped his head in at the window and began braying with all his might as if in opposition to the reverend preacher on this a wag present immediately got up from his seat and with great gravity of countenance exclaimed  one at a time gentlemen if you please the whole congregation set up a loud laugh when the jackass took fright and gave up the contest  though from the clergymans chagrin and confusion he would probably not have proved the worst orator  humorous anecdote of dr south and an old couple who wanted to be married dr south when he resided at caversham in oxfordshire was called out of bed on a cold winters morning by his clerk to marry a couple who were then waiting for him the doctor hurried up and went shivering to church but seeing only an old man of seventy with a woman about the same age and his clerk he asked the latter in a pet where the bridegroom and bride were and what that man and woman wanted the old man replying that they came there to be married the doctor looked sternly at him and exclaimed  married yes married said the old man hastily better marry than do worse  go get you gone you silly old souls said the doctor get home and do your wor and then hobbled out of church in a great passion with his clerk for calling him out of bed on such a ridiculous errand  statesmen like

ensuing feast ordered by scalas lord of high renown among the italians  i know not the town my brains have not as yet the secret heard which caused the guttling of this busy herd if on the subject i my thoughts may tell twas this that made their appetites to swell  the flesh the fowl and fricasees so nice the high ragouts so peppered all with spice in short all dainties that were ever seen to please the tastes of all both fat and lean the guests assembled in the sumptuous hall all shapes and sorts plump slender short and tall most came before the time they longed so much their maws to open and the meats to touch each minute was an hour each hour a day so slow the eaters drawld their time away and till the instant for the cram appeared nothing but flying compliments were heard the civil sayings of this hungry crowd were interrupted by the speaking loud of my lords major domo in a haste  my lord said he as youre a lord of taste and know full well what forms a dainty dish i come to tell you  there is such a fish brought by a man  it is equal never can be throughout all italy nor in the sea but then so strange a price he does demand   pho cried the marquis pay him i command whatever he asks and let the man be gone  i would my lord but money he will take none  what would the fellow then the marquis cried a hundred lashes  on his naked bide nor will he bate he swears a single blow say shall he have the price or must he go the marquis smiled then calling every guest chagrind and angry from the untouched feast through the long galleries took his jocund way resolved to gain the fish whatever the pay now in the court to see the man of eels on marched the count with hunger at his heels  well friend he cried what ask you for the fish ask what you will speak but the price you wish and i will give it  humbly then my lord and on a poor mans low but sacred word i cannot bate a stroke from what i have told for strokes to me are dearer now than gold  here paulo then the mighty scala cried pay this good man but pity his poor hide his humours droll and always i pursue the plan of giving even the devil his due the fellow stripped and paul began to whack a mighty strappado on his bare back whose brawny blades the thumps resounded loud in the hollow maws of this our hungrycrowd had a great genius who could tell by face the soul of each been witness at this place that such a change could instantly be wrought where would have been his art what had he thought to see so soon such alteration made as in the faces that were here displayed but to my tale for near the tale i am of this my story that delays the cram a cram most happy when it did begin where with his plate and napkin at his chin each gormd and guzzld in a woeful hurry lest he should lose his share of buck or curry mind said the fishman friend i will only have as many stripes as i at first did crave for by the mass these blows are not so sweet to make me greedy of such poignant meat at length when on his back the fiftieth came  hold straight he cried here we must change the game the rest my lord are to another due and justice i revere as well as you a partner in this business i have got nor would i rob him of a single jot the man your lordship too soon as you see will own deserves his share as well as me  a partner cried the marquis this is droll thou art a curious fellow on my soul nor can i penetrate thy strange design but speak thy will to grant it shall be mine  the man i mean my lord fored me to vow ere through your lordships gate he let go that whatsoever i got for my reward the price with him should instantly be shared this mans your porter and my lord i pray the promised debt your sturdy groom may pay  now by the holy mother cried my lord strong paul shall his full share of stripes afford call in the rascal he shall have his due aye that he shall with swingeing interest too his look commanded and the servants ran to bring with many a shout the guilty man who now all frightened all beset and bound the lusty lashes of young paul sound when these with might and main were well laid on the marquis sternly bade the wretch be gone then turning to the fisherman thus spoke  for thy most sage revenge thy pleasant joke a yearly pension on this very day to thee my friend i gratefully will pay call at my gate nor fear now searrd his skin he will ever hesitate to let thee in the fisherman low bowing straight withdrew and faster still returned the hungry crew gabbling they posted back with hasty pace but found no leisure for a word of grace eager to

spouse said to her dear  though wedded we have been these twice ten tedious years yet we no holiday have seen tomorrow is our wedding day and we will then repair unto the bell at edmonton all in a chaise and pair my sister and my sisters child myself and children three will fill the chaise so you must ride on horseback after we he soon replied  i do admire of womankind but one and you are she my dearest dear therefore it shall be done i am a linendraper hold as all the world does know and my good friend the callender will lend his horse to go quoth mrs gilpin  that is well said and for that wine is dear we will be furnished with our own which is so bright and clear john gilpin kissed his loving wise oerjoyd was he to find that though on pleasure she was bent she had a frugal mind the morning came the chaise was brought but yet was not allowed to drive up to the door lest all should say that she was proud so three doors off the chaise was staid where they did all get in six precious souls and all agog to dash through thick and thin smack went the whip round went the wheels were never folks so glad the stones did rattle underneath as if cheapside were made john gilpin at his horses side seized fast the flowing mane and up he got in haste to ride but soon came down again for saddletree scarce reached had he his journey to begin when turning round his face he saw three customers come in so down he came for loss of time although it grieved him sore yet loss of pence full well he knew would grieve him ten times more twas long before the customers were suited to their mind when betty screamd into his cars  the wine is left behind good lack quoth he yet bring it me my leathern belt likewise in which i bear my trusty sword when i do exercise now mistress gilpin  careful soul  had two stonebottles found to hold the liquor which she loved and keep it safe and sound each bottle had two curling cars through which the belt he drew he hung one bottle on each side to make his balance true then over all that he might be equipped from top to too his long red cloak wellbrushd and neat he manfully did throw now see him mounted once again upon his nimble steed full slowly pacing over the stones with caution and good heed but finding soon a smoother road beneath his wellshod feet the snorting beast began to trot which galled him in his seat so fair and softly john did cry but john he cried in vain that trot became a gallop soon in spite of curb or rein so stooping down as he needs must who cannot sit upright he grasped the mane with both his hands and eke with all his might away went gilpin neek or naught away went hat and wig he little dreamt when he set out of running such a rig the horse who never had before been handled in this kind affrighted fled and as he flew left all the world behind the wind did blow the cloak did sly like streamer long and gay till loop and button failing both at last it flew away then might all people well discern the bottles he had slung a bottle swinging at each side as has been said or sung the dogs did bark the children screamd up flew the windows all and every soul cried out  well done as loud as he could bawl away went gilpin  who but he his fame soon spread around  he carries weight  he rides a race  it is for a thousand pound and still as fast as he drew near twas wonderful to view how in a trice the turnpikemen their gates wide open threw and now as he went bowing down his reeking head full low the bottles twain behind his back were shattered at a blow down ran the wine into the road most piteous to be seen and made his horses flanks to smoke as he bad based been but still he seemed to carry weight with leatherngirdle braced for still the bottlenecks were left both dangling at his waist thus all through merry islington these gambols he did play and till he came unto the wash of edmonton so gay and there he threw the wash about on both sides of the way just like unto a trundlingmop or a wildgoose at play at edmonton his loving wife from the balcony spied her tender husband wondering much to see how he did ride stop stop john gilpin here is the house they all at once did cry the dinner waits and we are tired  said gilpin  so am i but ah his horse was not a whit inclined to tarry there for why  his owner had a house full ten miles off at ware so like an arrow swift he flew shot by an archer strong so did he fly  which brings me to the middle of my song away went gilpin out of breath and sore against his will till at his friends the callenders his horse at last stood still the callender surpised to see his friend in such a trim laid down his pipe flew to the gate and thus accosted him  what news what news  the tidings tell make haste and tell me all say why bareheaded you are come or why you come at all now gilpin had a pleasant wit and loved a timely joke and thus unto the callender in merry strains he spoke  i came because your horse would come and if i well forebode my hat and wig will soon be here they are upon the road the callender right glad to find his friend in merry pin returned him not a single word but to the house went in whence straight he came with hat and wig a wig that drooped behind a hat not much the worse for wca each comely in it is kind he held them up and in his turn thus showed his ready wit  my head is twice as big as yours they therefore needs must fit but let me scrape the dirt away that hangs about your face and stop and eat  for well you may be in a hungry case said john  it is my wedding day and folks would gape and stare if wife should dine at edmonton and i should dine at ware then speaking to his horse he said  i am in haste to dine twas for your pleasure you came here you shall go back for mine ah luckless word and bootless boast for which he paid full dear for while he spoke a braying ass did sing most loud and clear whereat his horse did snort as if he heard a lion rour and galld off with all his might as he had done before away went gilpin  and away went gilpins hat and wig he lost them sooner than at first for why  they were too big now gilpins wife when she had seen her husband posting down into the country far away she pulled out halfacrown and thus unto the youth she said that drove them to the bell  this shall be yours when you bring back my husband sase and well the youth did ride and soon they met he tried to stop johns horse by seizing fast the flowing rein but only made things worse for not performing what he meant and gladly would have done he thereby frightened gilpins horse and made him faster run away went gilpin  and away went postboy at his heels the postboys horse right glad to miss the lumber of the wheels six gentlemen upon the road thus seeing gilpin fly with postboy scampring in the rear they raised the hueandcry stop thief  stop thief  a highwayman not one of them was mute so they and all that passed that way soon joined in the pursuit but all the turnpikegates again flew open in short space the men still thinking as before that gilpin rode a race and so he did and won it too for he got first to town nor stopped till where he first got up he did again get down now let us sing  long live the king and gilpin long live he and when he next does ride abroad may i be there to see alliance with fortune by mr harrison once in an evil hour of

ruler over many things matthew xxv    a cure for vulgar prejudices against dress by mr harrison the absurd prejudices of the vulgar are in nothing more conspicuous than in their affected contempt of dress to which so many thousands of those who are most industriously disposed owe their entire subsistence  in spitalfields for example a few years ago till every porters knot began to cover a pigtail when any person of tolerable decency happened to pass through one of the many populous streets of that district with his hair queued he was insulted by myriads of men women and children swarming at the doors and windows with  look at his tail  only see there  la what a tail our cat has got  well i wish i had but a tail  and a hundred such speeches till he happily got into the somewhat more civilized regions of whitechapel shoreditch or bethnal green where he was only liable to occasional attacks from stragglers the poor thoughtless wretches never once considering that they should perhaps the next day be obliged to quit their habitations and solicit charity from the person they were then insulting for want of that very employ which the fashion they thus rudely discouraged was in some measure calculated to promote with the additional disadvantage of having steeled one who might otherwise have felt for their distres against spitalfields weavers in general by the indignities so universally received in that quarter and which must still be green in his remembrance  chairmen hackneycoachmen and watermen have also a large share of this disposition though they all owe much of their support to causes which could not exist without dress the necessary concomitant of visits and parties of pleasure and with respect to the last class of beings in particular it is absolutely impossible at present for any welldressed person to walk on the southern banks of the thames or on the opposite shore highter than london bridge without many salutations in what is emphatically styled water language as promulged in the neighboring university of billingsgate indeed from that famous seminary abuse is so plentifully disseminated among all the stallkeepers and basketcarriers in our markets and public streets and their respective connections that it bids fair for becoming what philosophers have long wanted a universal dialect nor can this universality be at all wondered at by those who consider that the venders of sprats oysters and other fish in the winter  the season when they take their academical degrees  are retailers of strawberries cherries gooseberries cucumbers cabbages and other fruits and vegetables in the summer and that they carry all their original learning vastly improved by practice into every new prosession which is more than can be said of many professors in other arts and sciences  but though the several respectable personages included in the classes just mentioned have powers of speech at least equal to those of any other callings or professions whatever calculated to express their antipa to what they choose to consider as something more than srsiuous attention to dress there are other tribes nearly as well qualified in these respects from their constant intercourse with those proficients and who have the additional advantage of being abundantly better furnished generally speaking from the nature of their occupations with implements capable of giving the most convincing proofs of their aversion to any thing like gaiety or even decency in apparel it is true that a basketwoman may knock a lady down o even a gentleman by running wilfully against them or she may content herself with only carrying off the headdress of the former or hat and wig of the latter to take their chance in the cleanliness of the street  a barrowgirl may dispose the handles of her barrow and a chairman his poles so as to throw down any person whose dress gives them offense or at least tear a gown a cloak or the skirt of a coat  and a coachman and a waterman most of my readers have probably had frequent opportunities of observing know perfectly well how to splash in the exercise of their respective vocations any similar offender who happens to be passing by them the one by making his horses suddenly plunge in a full kenned and the other by a dextrous maneuver with his oars but these contrivances excellent as they all undoubtedly are and highly to the credit of the several ingenious inventors as well as to the excellent police which encourages by not discouraging such laudable endeavors to increase the consumption of our manufactures are of little or no consequence when compared with the very superior exertions of lamplighters linkboys chimneysweepers scavengers dustmen butchers porters and a variety of others who are armed at all points to burn oil black cover with mud blind bruise and maim so that all genteel persons who never fail to excite their attention may esteem themselves extremely fortunate if they walk in the public streets for ten minutes without meeting with some accident as it is called either in person or dress  the success of these gentry in what seems to have become a part of their prfessions is indeed most astonishingly great and the proofs they so abundantly give seldom fail to met with universal approbation from the surrounding spectators who cordially join in the laugh which practices of this kind commonly inspire not always considering at whose expense some future mirth of the same kind may chance to be furnished so natural is it for man to enjoy the present without any retrospect of the past or much concern about the future  a circumstance however some time since came to my knowledge  for i was unfortunately not a spectator of the transaction  where a very laudable design of this nature was not taken in such good part as usual by the person on whom the intended favor was conferred to say the truth the gentleman who turned out the hero in the business to which i allude appears to have been rather too conversant in certain arts of the vulgar though few i apprehend will greatly blame his conduct on the present occasion when they have heard the whole story which i shall now endeavor to relate  a gentleman from the west end of the town who not only approved of putting on clean stockings but who was desirous to preserve them so as much as possible while they were on was one dirty day hastening to his bankers in cornhill with a very considerable sum in his pockets at the northeast corner of st pauls church yard exactly in the crossing to cheapside stood a seavengers cart attended by three or four begrimed myrmidons who had wilfully blocked up the way and waited the approach of a fit object for their mirth the gentlemans white silk stockings and his evident caution in walking instantly attracted their notice they accordingly set him down as a proper instrument and made the usual disposition to receive him spreading a large bed of mud across the way and waiing his approach with their scoops and besoms while one went forward to the horses that he might either bak them or make them spring forward among the filth as occasion served so as to produce the most mischievous effect a single hastly glance of the gentlemans eye however soon informed him what they meant to be at and in order to avoid them he kept to the left intending to cross by the end of newgate  formerly called blowbladder  street but the game was in view and they resolved not to lose their sport one of the fellows therefore running round the cart where he had clearly no other business met the gentleman as he passed the top of paternoster row and fixed the dirty scoop with so much adroitness that it not only made an ample spot on his stooking but very nearly threw him down it was with the utmost difficulty that the gentlemans spirit enabled him to bear for a moment this insolent attack but he wisely considered that he had more property about him than he should choose to lose that he had but a little way to go and that it would be impossible for them to have finished had they been more disposed to work than they evidently were before he should return he therefore hastened on without appearing to regard the universal roar of laughter against him and having dispatched his business was back in about twenty minutes at one trunkmakers the corner of st pauls froin whence he was about to cross by the others the fellow who had before met with such success and applause had observed him returning and was resolved to have a stroke at the other stocking he accordingly placed himself at the edge of the pavement with his back toward cheapside ready to turn round the instant the gentleman should come up with such an application of the muddy implement in his hand as could not well fail effectually to do the business thus stationed his grim features wore the aspect of vast selfcomplacency and those of his companions grinned their approbation the gentleman had expected some similar arrangement and having determined on the part which it would be proper for him to act took no pains to avoid the assailant but went fairly into his clutches the fellow however had very little time to congratulate himself on the good effect of his stratagem for the gentleman being fully prepared instantly fastened on his collar and with a single blow felled him to the earth the others now came round and with the ulmost liberality  of abuse were about to convince him that four men are more than a match for one but the temporary stoppage had in the mean time formed a crowd and several persons of genteel appearance being among them the gentleman addressed himself to one in particular and entreated him to deposit his hat coat and watch at the trunkmakers and to see that he had no foul play as he had determined to fight the blackguard who had insulted him in his own way this proposal gave universal satisfaction for even the aggressor himself little as he relished the specimen he had received from his antagonist entertained no sort of doubt that his own superior strength and skill joined to a pretty extensive practice would soon enable him to repay with interest the blow under which he still smarted and at any rate it was no small honor to box with a gentleman  while on the contrary any thing like a refusal to accept such a challenge would brand him with all the infamy of an eternal imputation of cowardice among his companions nor perhaps after all save him from a drubbing fully equal to what he should receive in fair fighting which of these reasons operated most powerfully or whether all of them acted in concert it is not by any means easy to decide however he lost no time in what beargarden phraseology denominates pecling and in a few minutes he was quite uncased in more refined language stripped to the skin  the ring was formed and the combatants took their stations the gentleman waited coolly to receive the fellow who advanced with great fury but the former dexterously avoided a most tremendous blow and at the same instant nimbly darting forward gave his antagonist a most severe stroke under the ribs which drove him breathless to the ground he rose again and was again treated precisely in the same manner with the addition of a deep cut in his skull received from a large stone on which he this second time fell he was now asked if he had enough and loud were the plaudits of the mob in praise of the gentlemans prowess which all declared they had never seen exceeded the fellow however was by no means satisfied for he had not once struck his antagonist and he confided that a single blow from his powerful arm could not fail to terminate the contest that blow therefore he determined in his own mind to give and approached for this purpose with much caution not forgetting to pay particular attention to the protection of his own ribs which had been twice so severely handled exactly in the same place the gentleman saw what was passing and took his measures accordingly he was round the fellow in a moment and darting a blow from which he instantaneously recoiled hit him exactly between the eyes with a violence which made them both swell to an enormous size and brought a torrent of blood from his nostrils he was now wild with anguish and disappointment and though he could hardly stand  for the blow had made him stagger though he was kept from quite falling  he rushed on with prodigious force and fury but extreme passion had now thrown him quite off his guard and another smart application to his ribs again beat him to the earth from whence he appeared in no condition speedily to arise without assistance indeed it was for some time doubted that he would ever again recover the gentleman however who had as much humanity as courage desired a surgeon might be sent for before he quitted the spot observing that it was his wish only to cure not to kill the fellow who had want only insulted him the mob felt that the gentlemans heart was good and with their usual attachment to what they think right they idolized his generosity as well as his courage and would almost to a man have now lost their lives in his defense what a pity that minds so well disposed should be ever misled what a pity that they do not always discover what is just had the gentleman been incapable of at first taking his own part the very same persons might have seen him treated with every indignity and indeed cruelty with the utmost unconcern or even perhaps with a thoughtless appearance of brutal satisfaction  the poor wretch being at length sufficiently recovered to stand on his legs he begged to shake hands with the gentleman and acknowledged he was sorry that he had illtreated a better man than himself the tears gushed from the gentlemans eyes at hearing this manly confession he gave the poor fellow his hand and with it a guinea telling his companions at the same time that they all deserved chastisement but that he hoped they would profit by what they had seen without the experience of a similar fate which must doubtless some time or other attend all who pursue such disgraceful practices they then severally protested that they were sorry for what they had done and though they evidently did not deserve any reward he generously gave half a crown among them which they declared they would spend in drinking his honors health and i dare venture to add that they most religiously kept their word  it happened some time after that the same gentleman  whose extreme neatness was very apt to give the filthy such offense as his size and appearance were not calculated to prevent them from resenting in their way  was passing down fishstreet hill when a tall chimneysweeper with his two lads literally brushed by him on each side and soiled his coat most egregiously this was an insult not to be borne he seized the biggest immediately and complimented him with just such another blow as he had formerly given the scavenger the fellow rose pretended the injury was quite accidental and insisted on receiving some satisfaction for the assault a crowd gathered round and the gentleman as before offered the aggressor battle the challenge was accepted and the sweep stripped in what is called buff but which did not in this case at least give any great idea of that color the ring was now formed and the combat was about to commence when a fellow rushed in stripped for the fight swearing heartily that the gentleman should not lessen himself by engaging in such a contest for that he himself would fight any man who offended him he gave no time for parley but instantly attacked the chimneysweeper and to it they went thoroughly in earnest in a few minutes victory declared herself against the chimneysweeper whose eyes were in a fair way for emulating the color of his cloth and the gentleman soon recognized in his present champion the scavenger whom he had a few months before so severely drubbed  there you dog cried the exulting victor to the discomfited sweep down on your marrowbones and thank me for your life by the lord harry if you had fought with that gentleman you would now have been in the other country for he licked me a little while ago twice as much as i have beat you so you dog i have saved your bacon and you ought at least to give me a guinea  well cried the gentleman my old friend you are fairly entitled to the guinea and you shall have it  he accordingly gave him that sum desiring him to afford the poor devil he had beaten a draught of beer out of it and away the combatants jogged cordially together to the next publickhouse where they related pretty fairly what had happened  to the great edification of many of their assembled brethren who have since been considerably more cautious of wantonly giving offense to gentlemen though some of the most mean and dastardly still occasionally gratify the native malevolence of their dispositions by making their dirty attacks on ladies however as no person who deserves the name of a gentleman  or indeed of a man  can tamely see any female thus insulted it is hoped that such practices as we become more polished and accomplished will soon totally decline and render unnecessary the administration of a remedy which though rough is not so dangerous as the timid are apt to suppose and which when properly applied never fails to give at least a temporary relief and seldom to effect a complete and lasting cure in that strange malady so peculiar to the vulgar  a loathing of decency in dress  story of a disabled veteran supposed to be told by himself by dr goldsmith as for my misfortunes master i cannot pretend to have gone through any more than other folks for except the loss of my limb and my being obliged to beg i dont know any reason thank heaven that i have to complain there is bill tibbs of our regiment he has lost both his legs and an eye to boot but thank heaven it is not so bad with me yet i was born in shropshire my father was a labourer and died when i was five years old so i was put upon the parish as he had been a wandering sort of a man the parishioners were not able to tell to what parish i belonged or where i was born so they sent me to another parish and that parish sent me to a third i thought in my heart they kept sending me about so long that they would not let me be born in any parish at all but at last however they fixed me i had some disposition to be a scholar and was resolved at least to know my letters but the master of the workhouse put me to business as soon as i was able to handle a mallet and here i lived an easy kind of life for five years i only wrought ten hours in the day and bad my meat and drink provided for my labor it is true i was not suffered to stir out of the house for fear as they said i should run away but what of that i had the liberty of the whole house and the yard before the door and that was enough for me i was then bound out to a farmer where i was up both early and late but i eat and drank well and liked my business well enough till he died when i was obliged to provide for myself so i was resolved to go and seek my fortune in this manner i went from town to town worked when i could get employment and starved when i could get none when happening one day to go through a field belonging to a justice of peace i spied a hare crossing the path just before me and i believe the devil put it into my head to fling my stick at it well what will you have on it i killed the hare and was bringing it away in triumph when the justice himself met me he called me a poacher and a villain and collaring me desired i would give an account of myself i fell on my knees begged his worships pardon and began to give a full account of all i knew of my breed seed and generation but though i gave a very good account the justice would not believe a syllable i had to say so i was indicted at the sessions found guilty of being poor and sent up to london to newgate in order to be transported as a vagabond people may say this and that of being in jail but for my part i found newgate as agreeable a place as ever i was in in all my life i had my bellyfull to eat and drink and did no work at all this kind of life was too good to last for ever so i was taken out of prison after five months put on board a ship and sent off to the plantations we had but an indifferent passage for being all confined in the hold more than a hundred died for want of sweet air and those that remained were sickly enough god knows when we came ashore we were sold to the planters and i was bound for seven years more as i was no scholar  for i did not know my letters  i was obliged to work among the negroes and i served out my time as in duty bound to do when my time was expired i worked my passage home and glad i was to see old england again  because i loved my country i was afraid however that i should be indicted for a vagabond once more so did not much care to go down into the country but kept about the town and did little jobs when i could get them i was very happy in this manner for some time till one evening coming home from work two men knocked me down and then desired me to stand they belonged to a pressgang i was carried before the justice and as i could give no account of myself i had my choice left whether to go on board a man of war or list for a soldier i chose the latter and in this post of a gentleman i served two campaigns in flanders was at the battles of val and fontenoy and received but one wound through the breast here but the doctor of our regiment soon made me well again when the peace came on i was discharged and as i could not work because my wound was sometimes troublesome i listed for a landman in the east india companys service i here fought the french in six pitched battles and i verily believe that if i could read or write our captain would have made me a corporal but it was not my good fortune to have any promotion for i soon fell sick and so got leave to return home again with forty pounds in my pocket this was at the beginning of the late war and i hoped to be set on shore and to have the pleasure of spending my money but the government wanted men and so i was pressed for a sailor before ever i could set a foot on shore the boatswain found me as he said an obstinate fellow he swore that he knew that i understood my business well but that i hammed abram merely to be idle but god knows i knew nothing of sea business and he beat me without considering what he was about i had still however my forty pounds and that was some comfort to me under every beating and the money i might have had to this day but that our ship was taken by the french and so i lost all our crew was carried into breast and many of them died because they were not used to live in a jail but for my part it was nothing to me for i was seasoned one night as i was sleeping on the bed of boards with a warm blanket about me  for i always love to lie well  i was awakened by the boatswain who had a darklanthorn in his hand jack say he to me will you knock out the french sentries brains  i dont care says i striving to keep myself awake it i lend a hand  then follow me says he and i hope we shall do their business so up i got and tied my blanket which was all the clothes i had about my middle and went with him to fight the frenchmen i hate the french because they are all slaves and wear woodenshoes though we had no arms one englishman is able to beat five french at any time so we went down to the door where both sentries were posted and rushing upon them seized their arms in a moment and knocked them down from thence nine of us ran together to the quay and seizing the first boat we met got safe out of the harbor and put to sea we had not been here three days before we were taken up by the dorset privateer who were glad of so many good hands and we consented to run our chance in three days we fell in with the pompadour privateer of forty guns while we had but twentythree so to it we went yardarm and yardarm the fight lasted for three hours and i verily believe we should have taken the frenchman had we but had some more men left behind but unfortunately we lost all our men just as we were going to get the victory i was once more in the power of the french and i believe it would have gone hard with me had i been brought back to breast but by good fortune we were retaken by the viper i had almost forgot to tell you that in that engagement i was wounded in two places i lost four fingers of the left hand and my leg was shot off if i had had the good fortune to have lost my leg and the use of my hand on board a kings ship and not on board a privateer i should have been entitled to clothing and maintenance during the rest of my life but that was not my chance one man is born with a silver spoon in his mouth and another with a woodenladle however blessed be god i enjoy good health and will for ever love liberty and old england liberty property and old england for ever  gradation from a greenhorn to a blood extracted from the adventurer though the characters of men have perhaps been essentially the same in all ages yet their external appearance has changed with other peculiarities of time and place and they have been distinguished by different names as new modes of expression have prevailed a periodical writer therefore who catches the picture of evanescent life and shows the deformity of follies which in a few years will be so changed as not to be known should be careful to express the character when he describes the appearance and to connect it with the name by which it then happens to be called you have frequently used the terms buck and blood and have given some account of the characters which are thus denominated but you have not considered them as the last stages of a regular progression nor taken any notice of those which precede them their dependence upon each other is indeed so little known that many suppose them to be distinct and collateral classes formed by persons of opposite interests tastes capacities and dispositions the scale however consists of eight degrees greenhorn jemmy jessamy smart honest fellow joyous spirit buck and blood as i have myself passed through the whole series i shall explain each station by a short account of my life remarking the periods when my character changed it is denomination and the particular incidents by which the change was produced  my father was a wealthy farmer in yorkshire and when i was near eighteen years of age he brought me to london and put me apprentice to a considerable shopkeeper in the city there was an awkward modest simplicity in my manner and a reverence of religion and virtue in my conversation the novelty of the scene that was now placed before me in which there were innumerable objects that i never conceived to exist rendered me attentive and credulous peculiarities which without a provincial accent a slouch in my gait a long lank head of hair and an unfashionable suit of drabcoloured cloth would have denominated me a greenhorn or in other words a country put very green  green then i continued even in externals near two years and in this state i was the object of universal contempt and derision but being at length wearied with merriment and insult i was very sedulous to assume the manners and appearance of those who in the same station were better treated i had already improved greatly in my speech and my father having allowed me thirty pounds a year for apparel and pocketmoney the greater part of which i had saved i bespoke a suit of clothes of an eminent citytaylor with several waistcoats and breeches and two frocks for a change i cut off my hair and procured a brown bob periwig of wilding just of the same color with a single row of curls round the bottom which i wore very nicely combed and without powder my hat which had been cocked with great exactness in an equilateral triangle i discarded and purchased one of a more fashionable size the sore corner of which projected near two inches father than those on each side and was molded into the shape of a spout i also furnished myself with a change of whitethread stockings took care that my pumps were varnished every morning with the new german blackingball and when i went out carried in my hand a little switch which as it had been long appendnt to the character that i had just assumed has taken the same name and is called a jemmy  i soon perceived the advantage of this transformation my manner had not indeed kept pace with my dress i was still modest and diffident temperate and sober and consequently still subject to ridicule but i was now admitted into company from which i had before been excluded by the rusticity of my appearance i was raillied and encouraged by turns and i was instructed both by precept and example some offers were made of carrying me to a house of private entertainment which then i absolutely refused but i soon found the way into the playhouse to see the two last acts and the farce here i learned that by breaches of chastity no man was thought to incur either guilt or shame but that on the contrary they were essentially necessary to the character of a fine gentleman i soon copied the original which i found to be universally admired in my morals and made some farther approaches to it in my dress i suffered my hair to grow long enough to comb back over the foretop of my wig which when i sallied forth to my evening amusement i changed to a queue i tied the collar of my shirt with half an ell of black ribband which appeared under my neckcloth the forecorner of my hat was considerably elevated and shortened so that it no longer resembled a spout but the corner of a minced pie my waistcoat was edged with a narrow lace my stockings were silk and i never appeared without a pair of clean gloves my address from it is native masculine plainness was converted to an excess of softness and civility especially when i spoke to the ladies i had before made some progress in learning to swear i had proceeded by fegs faith pox plague pon my life pon my soul rat it and zookers to zanns and the devil i now advanced to by jove before ged geds curse it and demme but i still uttered these interjections in a tremulous tone and my pronounciation was feminine and vicious i was sensible of my defects and therefore applied with great diligence to remove them i frequently practiced alone but it was a long time before i could swear so much to my own satisfaction in company as by myself my labor however was not without it is reward it recommended me to the notice of the ladies and procured me the gentle appellation of jessamy  i now learned among other grown gentlemen to dance which greatly enlarged my acquaintance i entered into a subscription for countrydances once a week at a tavern where each gentleman engaged to bring a partner at the same time i made considerable advances in swearing i could pronounce damme with a tolerable air and accent give the vowel it is full sound and look with confidence in the face of the person to whom i spoke about this time my fathers eldest brother died and left me an estate of near five hundred pounds per annum i now bought out the remainder of my time and this sudden accession of wealth and independence gave me immediately an air of greater confidence and freedom i laid out near one hundred and fifty pounds in clothes though i was obliged to go into mourning i employed a courttaylor to make them up i exchanged my queue for a bag i put on a sword which in appearance at least was a toledo and in proportion as i knew my dress to be elegant i was less solicitous to be neat my acquaintance now increased every hour i was attended flattered and caressed was often invited to entertainments fupped every night at a tavern and went home in a chair was taken notice of in public places and was universally confessed to be improved into a smart  there were some intervals in which i found it necessary to abstain from wenching and in these at whatever risque i applied myself to the bottle a habit of drinking came insensibly upon me and i was soon able to walk home with a bottle and a pint i had learned a sufficient number of fashionable toasts and had got by heart several toping and several bawdy songs some of which i ventured to roar out with a friend hanging on my arm as we scoured the street after our nocturnal revel i now labored with indefatigable industry to increase those acquisitions i enlarged my stock of healths made great progress in singing joking and storytelling swore well could make a company of staunch topers drunk always collected the reckoning and was the last man that departed my face began to be covered with red pimples and my eyes to be weak i became daily more negligent of my dress and more blunt in my manner i professed myself a foe to starters and milksops declared that there was no enjoyment equal to that of a bottle and a friend and soon gained the apellation of an honest fellow  by this distinction i was animated to attempt yet greater excellence i learned several feats of mimickry of the under players could take off known characters tell a staring story and humbug with so much skill as sometimes to takein a knowing one i was so successful in the practice of these arts to which indeed i applied myself with unwearied diligence and assiduity that i kept my company roaring with applause till their voices sunk by degrees and they were no longer able either to hear or to see i had now ascended another scale in the climax and was acknowledged by all who knew me to be a joyous spirit  after all these topics of merriment were exhausted and i had repeated my tricks my stories my jokes and my songs till they grew insipid i became mischievous and was continually devising and executing frolicks to the unspeakable delight of my companions and the injury of others for many of them i was prosecuted and frequently obliged to pay large damages but i bore all these loses with an air of jovial indifference i pushed on in my career i was more desperate in proportion as i had less to lose and being deterred from no mischief by the dread of it is consequences i was said to run at all and was complimented by the name of a buck  my estate was at length mortgaged for more than it was worth creditors were importunate i became neglectful of myself and others i made a desperate effort at the gamingtable and lost the last sum that i could raise my estate was seized by the mortgagee i learned to pack cards and to cog a die became a bully to whores passed my nights in a brothel the street or the watchhouse was utterly in sensible of shame and lived upon the town as a beast of prey in a forest thus i reached the summit of modern glory and had just acquired the character of a blood when i was arrested for an old debt of three hundred pounds and thrown into the kings bench prison  these characters sir though they are distinct yet do not at all differ otherwise than as shades of the same color and though they are stages of a regular progression yet the whole progress is not made by every individual some are so soon initiated in the mysteries of the town that they are never publicly known in their greenhorn state others six long in the jemmyhood others are jessamys at fourscore and some stagnate in each of the higher stages for life but i request that they may never hereafter be confounded either by you or your correspondents of the blood your brother adventurer mr wildgoose though he assumes the character does not seem to have a just and precise idea as distinct from the buck in which class he should be placed and will probably die for he seems determined to shoot himself just at the time when his circumstances will enable him to assume the higher distinctions  but the retrospect upon life which this letter has made necessary covers me with confusion and aggravates despair i cannot but reflect that among all these characters i have never assumed that of a man man is a reasonable being which he ceases to be who disguises his body with ridiculous fopperies or degrades his mind by detestable brutality these thoughts would have been of great use to me if they had occurred seven years ago if they are of use to you i hope you will send me a small gratuity for my labor to alleviate the misery of hunger and nakedness but dear sir let your bounty be speedy lest i perish before it arrive  i am your humble servant kings bench commonside nomentanus  a recruiting serjeants speech good people you

save the youth from total destruction by dividing him from his profligate companions he procured him to be sent on board a man of war the discipline of the navy he well knew must in some measure correct indolent habits and he hoped that the youth might yet be made a useful member of society this print accordingly presents our unpromising hero in the ships boat accompanied by his mourning mother whose dress denotes her widowhood and gives rise to the reflection that she is thus resigning her last hope the once fondly cherished solace and support of her declining years  in the mean time while the waterman is rowing coolly along and smoking the pipe of indifference with all a dutchmans frigidity one man in the boat sarcastically points to a pirate hanging in chains on a gibbet as an emblem of toms future destiny and the other with an elevated catoninetails displayed in a menacing way to the culprit bespeaks the previous chastisement he may expect at sea these hints he receives without emotion and to evince his equal talent for raillery displays two fingers held up as horns and calls the married mans attention to cuckolds point which at that instant appears in view where

sermon on the word malt preached by the rev mr dodd in a hollow tree the rev mr dodd a very worthy minister who lived a few miles from cambridge had rendered himself obnoxious to many of the cantabs by frequently preaching against drunkenness several of whom meeting him on a journey they determined to make him preach in a hollow tree which was near the roadside accordingly addressing him with great apparent politeness they asked him if he had not lately preached much against drunkenness on his replying in the affirmative they insisted that he should now preach from a text of their choosing in vain did he remonstrate on the unreasonableness of expecting him to give them a discourse without study and in such a place they were determined to take no denial and the word malt was given him by way of text on which he immediately delivered himself as follows   beloved let me crave your attention  i am a little man come at a short warning to preach a short sermon from a small subject in an unworthy pulpit to a small congregation beloved my text is malt i cannot divide it into words it being but one nor into syllables it being but one i must therefore of necessity divide it into letters

this short and whimsical sermon than by any serious discourse they had ever heard  proposed hospital for decayed authors i sit down to write in behalf of a set of gentlemen in this town called authors whose appearance in public for many prudent reasons being seldom and their habitations far above the common level with the rest of mankind they pass unnoticed by the generality of the world and are looked upon by others as a name without a being  from whence this want of respect for so considerable a body of men proceeds i will not take upon me to say but certain it is that many worthy wits by profession are starving in garrets while the gravitation of dullness daily brings hundreds to and from the exchange and the neighboring alleys in their chariots  what a sad reflection it is that the most beautiful ode in horace will not raise sixpence in the city when an ordinary knowledge of the multiplicationtable will accumulate estates i this unaccountable humor in the nation of preferring the writings of the bank directors to those of the sons of parnassus has reduced many a fine poetical genius to darn his own stockings  a friend of mine who accidentally became acquainted with two or three of these great men who nobly defy poverty for the sake of exhibiting their extraordinary talents took me one day to visit them in their occupation we were led by the master of the house where they lodged a bookseller by trade up a very handsome pair of stairs where i imagined we should have been introduced to the literati on the first floor but how great was my surprise to be conducted up two or three stories more and then up a ladder into a cockloft where eight or nine of these illustrious spirits were amusing themselves with compositions of various sorts not as our guide seemed to insinuate for the lucre of porter and pudding but from the noble motive of benefiting mankind by their lucubrations i must own their unsuitable situation made me feel some concern for them though they seemed to have very little for themselves but my attention to their deplorable circumstances was interrupted by a mistake that my ignorance of their trade led me into for after the first introductory salutations were over they fell again to their former employments without taking any farther notice of us and as i was very attentive out of curiosity i heard one of them call softly across the table to another who sat opposite to him  prythee matt prior lend me thy simile of the birdsnest  on my expressing some surprise at the name of matt prior my friend whispered me that every one of the gentlemen personated some poet of note and imitated as well as they were able his style and that such compositions were published under the titles of remains posthumous works etc i cannot say but my indignation began to be kindled at a proceeding so injurious to the deceased had not an object of a different nature excited my laughter for while these deputy harmonists were coupling their rhimes together an old woman of a venerable aspect mounted the ladder and informed the company that the milkporridge was ready the pens were instantly sluck behind their ears the ink remained in peace and the sound of beams purling streams loves doves and groves was heard no more  i imagined as soon as the visit was over that my acquaintance with these sons of the muses would be so too but i very soon after found my error for as i was walking in st jamess park the next sunday i observed three gentlemen in rusty philosophical black coats brasshilted swords and tyewigs rising up from one of the benches to meet me when they were come a little nearer i perceived one of them to be my old friend the similelender the worthy representative of matt prior who accosted me with the most obliging condescension  as our conversation during my stay in the park was pretty long i shall not trouble you with a particular account of it any farther than to acquaint you that it began with animadverting on the damned taste of the town as they called it and concluded with their borrowing half a crown apiece of me such is the condition of many a great soul in this kingdom who magnanimously scorning to engross to pound in a mortar or live like any other vile mechanic has rather chose to confine himself six days in seven feeling the inward call of a poetical spirit than breathe the same air with the illiterate multitude as many hundreds therefore are led into great inconveniences not by their own faults but by this writing devil that possesses them i think it would be a charity altogether worthy of the present public spirit to found an hospital for necessitous authors such i mean as are not quite furious for those of course will be admitted into that founded by the late dean of st patricks for lunaticks and as no scheme of this sort has hitherto been laid before the public i beg leave to insert the following in your miseellany  the first thing to be considered is a proper spot to build an hospital on for which i think tothill fields would be very convenient as they lie contiguous to the banks of the fertile thames whose streams have been the subject of so many fine compositions and may serve to recall even in old age the ideas of their former rapture the structure should be of the old gothic collegiate architecture containing about two hundred apartments not regular and uniform but of different sizes etc according to the different geniuses and dispositions of those that are to be admitted  in this point too the situation of the chambers ought to be observed for instance the compilers of vademecums abridgementmakers etc should be stationed in the cellars underground the odewriters next to the skylight the translators on the groundfloor and the epick and dramatick authors on the first and second stories in the midst of the whole i would have a large hall where the whole society should meet three times a day to be provided at every meal with dishes adapted to their constitutions for care must be had that the gentlemen who soar above the visible diurnal sphere do not eat of beef or any other meat that is subject to clog the intellects but be fed as pindar and the bards of old were with food that elates and puts the fancy on the wing  this college should be governed by a president and twelve directors all of whom should have been booksellers in london for the space of seven years before the time they are elected such that they may be thereby qualified to judge properly of the pretensions of the candidates to this charity every candidate must have the recommendation of one or more of the directors and a certificate under the hands and seals of four of the company of stationers that he has been muserid for ten years in such a manner as to be entirely incapacitated for any other vocation in life if these things seem clear the person shall be admitted without farther trouble except he is proved to be worth money for a rich man must be as incapable to enter this hospital as the kingdom of heaven  we next come to the choice of proper servants and attendants now as there are in the three kingdoms innumerable footmen and chambermaids who spend best part of their time with lee and otway and daily condemn fate for having placed people of their uncommon talents in such a situation as to be subject to be called every moment from the heroic company of alexander and roxana and sent to converse much against their inclination with the dregs of the people i would have such as are disposed to live retired and to have frequent opportunities of conversing not only with dead poets but living wits come and offer their service to the hospital where they shall be furnished with every thing necessary for life and be allowed after the little labor that shall be required of them is over stated hours for their favorite studies  when these things are all settled and a handsome subscription is opened the legislature no doubt will give encouragement to so noble useful and charitable a foundation by establishing the lands and funds raised for it is support by parliamentary authority and if it would not be looked on as presumption to give a hint to so wise and august an assembly a tax might be laid which would bring in vast sums annually and at the same time be no burden to the industrious subject but tend on the contrary to promote every branch of trade in the nation  the tax i mean should be laid on that unprofitable commodity which abounds so much in these kingdoms commonly called scribbling there should be in every parish an inspector into this manufactory  the parson for instance  who should take his rounds once a week like the exciseman to visit those who are dealers and receive the limited duty and in order to obviate any fraud very large penalties might be laid on all such as should clandestinely make verse or prose or a mixture of both which i think is most in request at present without previously acquainting the ecclesiastical officer or at least informing him immediately after this expense would hinder many an attorneys clerk and apprentice from philising away his time and keep him from being reduced at last to the hospital  should it be objected by the proprietors of other periodical miscellanies that such tax would deprive them of many ingenious performances both in verse and prose the grievances may be redressed by applying to the directors and compounding with them at so much a year for all their authors in a lump as those people do with commissioners of turnpikes who live near the gate  having thrown together these loose thoughts i leave the public to improve my project and shall be happy to subscribe my mite for the establishment of so necessary an institution  the choice spirit that a tradesman has no business with humor unless perhaps in the way of his dealing or with writing unless in his shopbook is a truth which i believe nobody will dispute with me i am so unfortunate however as to have a nephew who not contented with being a grocer is in danger of absolute ruin by his ambition of being a wit and having forsaken his counter for comuss court and dignified himself with the appellation of a choice spirit is on the point of becoming a bankrupt instead of distributing his shopbills as he ought he wates a dozen in the morning by scribbling shreds of his nonsense on the backs of them and a few days since affronted an alderman his best customer by sending him a pound of prunes wrapped up in a ballad he had just written called the citizen outwitted or a bob for the mansion house  he is likewise a regular frequenter of the play houses and being acquainted with every underling of each theater is at an annual expense of ten pounds in tickets for their respective benefits they generally adjourn together from the play to the tavern and there is hardly a watchman within a mile of covent garden but has had his head or his lantern broke by one or other of the ingenious fraternity  i turned into his shop this morning and had no sooner set my foot on the threshold than he leaped over the counter threw himself into an attitude as he calls it and asked me in the words of some play that i remember to have seen formerly whether i was a spirit of health or a goblin damned i told him he was an undutiful young dog for daring to accost his uncle in that irreverent manner and bade him speak like a christian and a reasonable person instead of being sensible of my rebuke he took off his wig and having very deliberately given it two or three twirls on his fist and pitching it on his head again said i was a dry old quiz and should certainly afford them much entertainment at the club to which he had the impudence to invite me at the same time he thrust a card into my hand containing a bill of fare for the evenings entertainment and as a farther inducement assured me that mr twister himself would be in the chair that he was a wonderful creature and so prodigiously droll that though he had heard him sing the same songs and repeat the same stories a thousand times he could still attend to him with as much pleasure as at first i cast my eye over the list and can recollect the following items  to all true lovers of fun and jocularity  mr twister will this evening take off a cat worried by two bulldogs ditto making love in a gutter the knifegrinder and his wheel high dutch squabble and a hog in a slaughterhouse  i assured him that so far from having any relish for these detestable noises the more they resembled the originals the less i should like them and if i could ever be fool enough to go should at least be wise enough to stop my ears till i came out again  having lamented my deplorable want of taste by the elevation of his eyebrows and a significant shrug of his shoulders he thrust his forefinger against the inside of his cheek and plucking it out of his mouth with a jerk made a noise that very much resembled the drawing of a cork i found that by this signal he meant to ask me if i chose a whet i gave my consent by a sulky kind of nod and walked into the back room as much ashamed of my nephew as he ought to have been of himself while he was gone to fetch a pint of mountain from the other side of the street i had an opportunity to minute down a few of the articles of which the litter of his apartment consisted and have selected these as the most material from among them   on one of the sconces by the chimney a smart grizzle bobwig well oiled and powdered feather topped and bagfronted  on the opposite sconce a scratch  on the windowseat a nankin waistcoat bound with silvertwist without skirts or pockets stained with red wine and pretty much shrunk  item a pair of buckskin breeches in one pocket a catcall in the other the mouth of a quartbottle chipped and ground into a smooth ring very fit to be used as a spyingglass by those who never want one  item a red plush frock lappelled with ditto one pocket stuffed with orangepeel and the other with square bits of white paper ready cut and dried for a shower  in the corner a walkingstaff about eighteen inches long  item a small switch  on the head of the bureau a lettercase containing a playbill and a quackbill a copy of verses being an encomium on mr twister another of four lines which he calls a distich and a third very much blotted and scratched and yet not finished entitled an extempore epigram  having taken this inventory of his goods and furniture i sat down before the fire to devise if possible some expedient to reclaim him when on a sudden a sound like the braying of an ass at my elbow alarmed me to such a degree that i started from my seat in an instant and to my farther astonishment beheld my nephew almost black in the face covering his eat with the hollow of his hand and exerting the whole force of his lungs in imitating that respectable animal i was so exasperated at this fresh instance of his folly that i told him hastily he might drink his wine alone and that i would never see his face again till he should think proper to appear in a character worthy himself and family he followed me to the door without making any reply and having advanced into the middle of the street ell to clapping his sides and crowing like a cock with the utmost vehemence and continued his triumphant ejaculations till i was fairly out of hearing  having reached my lodgings i immediately resolved to send you an account of his absurdities and shall take this opportunity to inform him that as he is blessed with such a variety of useful talents and so completely accomplished as a choice spirit i shall not do him the injury to consider him as a tradesman or mortify him hereafter by endeavoring to give him any assistance in his business  curious claim of kindred a portley and welldressed man lately walking along the strand suddenly dropped down in an apoplectic fit and though no less a man than his majestys phyician in ordinary was coming by at the time and was willing to give every assistance the materia medica could afford it was all in vain the body was dead beyond the reach of any physician except the last trumpet a corpse in the strand unowned soon drew a crowd among whom came a welldressed good looking young gentleman who was curious to see the dead man he had no sooner made his way through the mob so as to get a full view of the corpse than he was struck with amazement he remained fixed his countenance changed and the tears began to flow down his cheeks as soon as he could recover himself so far as to gain utterance he exclaimed  o god my poor uncle is he gone is he  well said he with a deep sigh so perish my hopes i am happy however that i luckily passed at this awful moment to rescue his poor remains and see them decently interred accordingly the sorrowful youth called a coach and the charitable mob who pitied the disconsolate nephew assisted to put the corpse in the coach where the pious young man soon stripped the body and desiring to be set down at a famous surgeons very conscientiously sold his pretended uncle for two guineas  improvements on the catorgan addressed to the royal society gentlemen i need not inform persons of your infinite experience and erudition that the catorgan as it has hitherto been made use of was no more than what follows viz a plain harpsichord which instead of having strings and jacks consists of cats of different sizes included in boxes whose voices express every note in the gamut which is extorted from the imprisoned animals by placing their tails in grooves which are properly squeezed by the impression of the organists fingers on the keys this instrument unimproved as it was i have often heard with incredible delight but especially in the grand and plaintive this delight grew upon me every time i was present at it is performance at length i shut myself up for seven years to study some additions and improvements which i have at length accomplished agreeable to my warmest wishes and which i with all due submission now lay before you  in the first place then it is universally known and acknowledged that these animals at the time of their amors are the most musical creatures in nature i would therefore recommend it to all and singular catorganists to have a most especial regard to the time of caterwauling particularly if they have anything very august or affecting to exhibit  secondly it is also very well known that the best voices are improved by castration i therefore never have less than eight geldings in my treble clef and here i cannot help informing you of an experiment i lately made on an italian boarcat and and english one of the same gender and i solemnly protest that after the operation my country animal had every whit as delicate piercing and comprehensive a tone as the foreigner and i make no sort of doubt that some of our harmonious englishmen would shine with an equal luster if they had the same advantages as the italians this may be worth the consideration of people in power for if this experiment had been tried with success how many thousand pounds would it have saved this nation  thirdly of the forte and piano i must not omit to tell you gentlemen that my catorgan resembles a double harpsichord for as that has two rows of keys so mine has two layers of cats both of a lesser size and whose tails are squeezed by a much less pressure that is by nothing but the bare extremity of the key but the lower row on which i play forte or loudly contains an harmonious society of banging grimalkins and whose tails are severely pricked by brass pins inserted at the end of the key for that purpose  fourthly of the shake there was one enormous defect in this instrument before i took it in hand and that was in the shake the imperfection of which gave me great offense but as it is now managed it has the most ravishing effect in the world there are between all the keys little wires fixed almost imperceptibly these go underneath till they reach each pusss throat at the extremity of these wires are placed horizontally wrens quills about the length of a quarter of an inch when the artist therefore has a mind to form his shake he touches the wires which soon send the quills in a tickle tickle tickle tickle up to the cats throat and causes the most gurgling warbling shaking quaking trembling murmuring sound in the world  fifthly of the staccato and an infallible method of keeping the fourfooted performers under proper regulations  this most intolerable deficiency of the old catorgan was as follows some of the cats were apt to continue their mew after the proper note was expressed to the great confusion of the tune and vexation of the organist this i have entirely cured and i think i can play the most perfect staccato in the world i have underneath my instrument a treddle like that of a spinningwheel which i work with my foot this treddle actuates a certain number of forceps or pincers which open and shut at my pleasure upon the noses and chins of all the cats and if any of them overact their part i tip st dunstan upon mrs puss and she is obliged of necessity to be silent  sixthly of the education of cats for the organ my predecessors were egregiously out in this article as well as many others which whatever it may appear to the incredulous or incurious is a matter of importance with regard to their diet milk and flummery fried mice and fish have the best effect i mean for the trebles and tenors as for the bases i have fed them with good success on bullocks liver hogs harslets and sometimes with viands of a much less delicate nature as for exercise moderate mousing and being well tugged and hauled about by the children will very well suffice  mr collier in his essay on music says  that he makes no doubt that there might be a warlike instrument contrived of such an hideous sound that instead of inspiring men with courage it would strike the most undaunted with dismay this may be effected by the abovementioned instrument for though the catorgan when accurately in tune is incomparably melodious yet it may be so managed as to utter shrieks very little inferior to the cries of the infernals themselves happy that instrument where terror and transport ornament and utility are so exquisitely blended which by it is persuasive harmony can at one time draw st cecilia from the spheres and at another with proper alteration would frighten away the devil himself in propria persona  the wooden sword a popish miracle when naples was once closely besieged the viceroy issued a severe order that no man above or under such an age should appear in the streets without a sword on pain of death that he might be sure this order was strictly obeyed he and his officers rode up and down the city to see that none offended during their progress they perceived a gentleman without his sword who being brought to the viceroy was immediately condemned to be hanged on the next signpost the gentleman pleaded hard for his life but to no purpose he then entreated that at least he might not suffer so ignominious a death but die like a gentleman as he was humbly desiring that the next gentleman who came by with a sword might be permitted to run him through the body this being granted presently came along one who had just quitted a gaminghouse where he had lost all even to the very blade of his sword which was of choice spanish steel and durst not go home till he had got a wooden one fitted to the hilt and scabbard being now stopped he was told the case and what office he was appointed to perform conscious of his own insufficiency to execute the business he was so confounded that he scarcely knew how to reply what exclaimed he would you make a common executioner of me alas shall i stain my blood to eternity heaven defend my honor from such baseness all his remonstrances however proving quite fruitless he prepared himself for the work and keeling down prayed   o just and almighty ruler of heaven if this man ought not to die convert this my faithful sword into wood then plucking it out and it appearing plainly to be a wooden blade the condemned gentleman was immediately released with abundance of joy and the sword was carried with great solemnity to the cathedral church where it was hung up as a true link to the chain of popish miracles  legal interpretation of a will the glorious uncertainty of the law extends itself over every state where any regulated code exists ingenuity of counsel in the explanation of periods and interpretation of meanings is exercised with as much success in the courts of our gallick neighbors as in those of our own country some time before the abolition of the jesuits a gentleman of paris died and left all his estate from an only son then abroad to that body of religious men on condition that on his return the worthy fathers should give him la party qui leur plairoit  whatever they chose when the son came home he went to the convent and received but a very small share indeed the wise sons of loyola chasing to keep the greatest part to themselves the young gentleman consulted his friends and all agreed that he was without remedy at last a barrister to whom he happened to mention his case advised him to sue the convent and promised to gain him his cause the gentleman followed his advice and the suit terminated in his favor through the management of the advocate who grounded his plea on this reasoning   the tellator said the ingenious barrister has left his son that share of the estate which the fathers should choose la party qui leur plairoit are the express words of the will now it is plain what part they have chose by what they keep to themselves my client then stands on the words of the will let me have says he  the part they chose and i am satisfied it was accordingly awarded to him without hesitation  king richards three daughters one fulk a frenchman of high repute for sanctity told king richard the first that he kept three daughters who would certainly bring on him the wrath of god if he did not part with them why you hypocrite exclaimed richard all the world knows i never had a child in my life  yes replied the monk you have as i asserted three and their names are pride covetousness and lewdness   well retorted the king since it is so i will soon dispose of them the knights templars shall have the first the white friars the second and the third shall be given to the secular clergy  the soldiers salvo or the cards spiritualized by a private soldier one richard middleton a private soldier attending divine service with the rest of the regiment at a church in glasgow instead of pulling out a bible like his brother soldiers in order to search for the text spread a pack of cards before him this singular behavior did not long pass unnoticed either by the minister or the sergeant of the company to which he belonged the latter in particular commanded him to put up his cards and on his refusal conducted him after divine service before the chief magistrate to whom he preferred a formal complaint of richards irreverend behavior well soldier said the magistrate what excuse have you to offer for this strange and scandalous behavior if you can make any apology or assign any reason for it it is well if you cannot assure yourself that i will cause you to be severely punished   since your honor is so good replied richard as to permit me to speak for myself ant please your worship i have been eight days on the march with a bare allowance of sixpence a day which your honor will surely allow is hardly sufficient to find a man in meat drink washing and other necessaries and consequently he may want either a bible prayer book or any other book on saying this richard pulled out his cards presented one of the aces to the magistrate and continued his address to him as follows  when i see an ace may it please your honor it reminds me that there is only one god and when i look on a two or a three the former puts me in mind of the father and son and the latter of the father son and holy ghost a four calls to my remembrance the four evangelists matthew mark luke and john a five the five wise virgins who were ordered to trim their lamps  there were ten ordered but five your worship may remember were wise and five were foolish  a six that in six days god created heaven and earth a seven that on the seventh day he rested from all he had made an eight of the eight righteous persons preserved from the deluge viz noah and his wife with his three sons and their wives a nine  of the lepers cleansed by our savior  there were ten but one only returned to offer his tribute of thanks and a ten of the ten commandments richard took the knave and placed it by him and then passed to the queen on which he observed as follows  this queen your worship reminds me of the queen of sheba who came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of solomon as her companion the king does of the great king of heaven and of king george the third  well replied the magistrate you have given me a very good description of all the cards except the knave  if your honor will not be angry with me replied richard i can give you the same satisfaction as to that as of any card in the pack  i will not said the magistrate well returned the soldier the greatest knave i know is the sergeant who brought me before you  i dont know replied the magistrate whether he is the greatest knave or not but i am sure he is the greatest fool or the two the soldier then proceeded  when i count the number of dots in a pack of cards there are     so many days are there in a year when i count how many cards there are in a pack i find fifty two so many weeks are there in a year when i reckon how many tricks are won by a pack of cards i find there are thirteen so many months are there in a year so that this pack of cards is both bible almanac and prayer book to me  the magistrate then called his servants ordered them to entertain the soldier well gave him a piece of money and said he was the cleverest fellow in the whole regiment  the welsh parsons curse a welsh vicar being to read the curses as the custom is on ash wednesday when the people say amen turning over the leaf

desolation and barrenness every where presenting themselves to his view till at last he cast his eyes on a crow that was perched on the stump of an old tree gnawing with great violence and kawing for

creditor calling on him to hear it   i have been thinking said he that it is a very idle thing for me to lie here and put you to the expense of seven groats a week my being so chargeable to you has given me great uneasiness and god knows what it may cost you in the end therefore what i would propose is this  you shall let me out of prison and instead of seven groats you shall allow me only

virtuous and beloved daughter  the residence of these respectable citizens is situated near the monument part of which stately column as well as the first lines of the inscription is sufficiently visible the point of time is the morning after the happy nuptials while the newly married pair are at breakfast the cavalcade of drummers butchers with marrowbones and cleavers the man with the bassviol etc form the then usual concert on such occasions and which is not remarkably figurative of the harmony that ought to follow the ceremony it pretends to celebrate the wretched cripple in the corner who is adding to the hymeneal music by vociferating the ballad of jesse or the happy pair represents a well known beggar of that period commonly called philip in the tub and who within the memory of some persons still living is recollected to have been a usual attendant at most weddings in the metropolis the poor wretch  who has perhaps too feminine an aspect  appears to have lost both legs above the knee and to have shuffled along in his tub by the aid of a low stool for the right hand there is much sentiment even in the attitude and aspect of this mendicants dog and the irascibility of one of the butchers with the mixed personal terror and anxiety about his instrument manifested by the bass vil performer who has good reason for the concern thus depicted in his countenance at once gives forcible action and a striking contrast to the general intended harmony of the scene while mr goodchild is generously presenting a piece of moey to the principal drummer his servant is employed in charitably distributing some remains of the marriage feast to a poor woman and her infant the bride is also at the window but in the back ground modestly gratifying the curiosity of the spectators with a sight of her agreeable person and not any vanity of her own by an ostentatious display of gaudy dress or the smallest degree of personal affectation  the motto is exactly what it ought to be   the virtuous woman is a crown to her husband proverbs xii   humorous specimen of alliteration in an epistle from paul philip price esquire at pembroke to mr peter pettiward at putney dear sir perceiving you particularly desirous to know how i pass my time in pembrokeshire i here present you with particulars of my proceedings in a progress i lately made to a gentlemans house purely to procure a plan of it  i proceeded in a party of pleasure with mr pratt of pickton castle mr powell of penally and pugh of purley to go and dine with mr pritchard of postmain which was readily agreed to and soon put in practice however i thought it a proper precaution to post away a person privately to mr pritchards that he might provide for us and we proceeded after him the town where mr pritchard lives is a poor pitiful paltry place though his house is in the prettiest part of it and is a princes palace to the rest his parlour is of a lofty pitch and full of pictures of the prime pencils he has a pompous portico or pavilion prettily paved leading to the parterre from whence you have a prodigious prospect particularly pointing toward percilly hill where he propagates a parcel of portuguese and polish poultry the name of his house is prawfenden which puzzled me most plaguily to pronounce properly he received us very politely and presented us with a plentiful dinner at the upperend of the table was a pike with fried perch and plaise at the lower end pickled pork pease and parsnips in the middle a pigeonpye with puffpaste on the one side a potatoepudding and on the other side pigs pettytoes the second course was a dish of pheasants with poults and plovers and a plate of preserved pine and pippins another with pickled podd pepper another with prawns another with pargamon for a provocative with apyramid pears peaches plums pippins philberts and pislachi after dinner there was a profusion of port and punch which proved too powerful for poor mr peters the parson of the pari for it pleased his palate and he poured it down by pints which made him prate in a pedantick and pragmatical manner this displeased mr price the parliament man a profound politician but he persisted and made it a prolix preamble which proved his principles prejudiced and patial against the present people in power mr price who is a potent partyman called him a popish parson and said he prayed privately in his heart for the pretender and that he was a presumptuous priest for preaching such stuff publicly the parson puffed his pipe passively for some time because mr price was his patron but at length losing all patience he plucked off mr prices perriwig and was preparing to push it with the point of the poker into the fire upon which mr price perceiving a pewter pisspot in the passage presented the parson with the contents in his phizz and gave him a pat on the pate the percussion of which prostrated him plump on the pavement and raised a protuberance on his pericranium this put a period to our proceedings and patched up a peace for the parson was in a piteous plight and had prudence enough to be prevailed upon to cry  peccavi with a  parce precor and in a plaintive posture to petition for pardon mr price who was proud of his performance pulled him out of the puddle and protested he was prodigiously sorry for what had passed in his passion which partly proceeded from the provocation produced by some of his preposterous propositions which he prayed him never to presume to advance again in his presence mr pugh who practiced physic prescribed phlebotomy and a poultice to the parson but he preferred wetted brownpaper to any plaster and then placed himself in a proper position that the power of the fire might penetrate his posteriors and dry his purple plushbreeches this pother was succeeded by politics as mr pulteney the patriots patent for the peerage the kings of poland and prussia prague the palatines pandours and par izans portsmouth paades and the presumption of the privateers picking up prizes in our very ports with places and pensions pains and penalties next came on plays and poetry the picture of mr pope petched on a prostistute the price of the play houses the pit pantomimes prudes the pox the primate of ireland printers paupers preferments pickpockets pensioners pointers puppies and the pranks of that prig the poet laurets progeny though his papa is the perfect pattern of paternal piety to be brief i prophesy you perceive i am prolix we parted at last but had great difficulty to procure a passage from mr pritcuard for he had placed a padlock on the stabledoor on purpose to prevent us and pretended his servant was gone out with the key but finding us peremptory the key was produced and we were permitted to go we pricked our palfreys a good pace although it was as dark as pitch which put me in pain because i was purblind lest we should ride plumb against the posts which are prefixed to keep horsepassengers from going the path that is pitched with pebbles  mr price who was our pilot had a very providential escape for his pad fell a prancing and would no pass one step farther which provoked him much for he piques himself on his horsemanship i propoed to him to dismount which he did and peeping and peering about found he was upon the point of a perpendicular precipice from which he might probably have pitched pate forward had not his horse plunged in that particular manner this put us all into a palpitation and we plodded on the rest of the progression pian piano as the italians say or pazz a pazz as the french phrase has it i shall postpone other particulars till i have the pleasure of passing a day with you at putney which shall be as soon as possible i am sir your most humble servant  paul philip price  to mr peter pettiward at putney pennypost paid scheme for a whistling academy we have often compassionated the great uneasiness numbers of young gentlemen at this day labor under for want of knowing how to spend their time which seems to hang heavy on their hands being destitute of a proper employment to see so many distressed mortals sauntering about from coffeehouse to coffeehouse or from alehouse to alehouse tiring themselves and those about them must certainly afford a melancholy prospect to every good natured man living read they cannot to think is a task more difficult unable therefore to be one moment alone they run into any sort of company that first occurs talking without sense laughing without wit and by this means become the ridicule of all their acquaintance in this wretched state despised by men and made the laughing stock of women they have recourse to the bottle with this they regale and in a short time become the most whimsical impertinen and rattleheaded fellows in the world  if this species of mortals did not think themselves too wise and too happy to stand in need of advice or to wish a change in their condition it would certainly be worth while to consider if some easy accomplishment suited to their capacities might not be found out the learning and practice of which might serve to render them supportable to themselves and not altogether insupportable to those who are so unhappy as to fall into their bad company  to answer both these good purposes i can think of nothing so likely as their learning to whistle it is an attainment perfectly suited to their genius equal to their abilities and in all likelihood superior to any of their accomplishments i would therefore teach these untutored gentlemen to apply themselves instantly to the making at least one acquisition that may raise them to a level with something in the animal creation if they could but whistle wll they might be able to converse with the blackbird and thrush almost on an equality an advantage they seldom enjoy in human conversation unless a prostitute a horse or the cut of a coat etc happen to be the subject besides their endeavoring to attain an accomplishent that may serve as an innocent amusement in the midst of a world where so many pernicious ones abound will be an instance of their singular virtue and supply the want of thought which want they seem to labor under in the most easy or natural way  how happy had it been for young hazard if instead of attempting what he is by no means equal to namely the art of gaming he had applied himself to the attainment of this amusing science he might then with a merry heart have been whistling for his diversion whereas now he may in bitterness of soul go whistle for his estate  if some of those creatures also who call themselves poets were wise enough to apply their talents to whistling they might fairly pretend to some sort of harmony but now they are not only destitute of that but of every thing else that might atone for the want of it  the description of cymon in that beautiful tale of mr dryden has ever been esteemed a natural and agreeable picture there is something in him so undesigning that one is assured he must be possessed of an honest heart and cannot help conceiving an affection for him merely in seeing him walk and hearing him whistle  he trudged along unknowing what he sought and whistled as he went for want of thought   how harmless is his employment how inoffensive his behavior now i should be heartily glad to see any of our sauntering fellows make so unexceptionable a figure as this honest clown but these gentlemens want of thought generally leads them into a thousand impertinences and instead of learning to whistle they are frequently making ridiculous pretensions to taste learning or politics and there is not a coffeehouse in london but will furnish us with melancholy instances of this strange misapplication of talents  to prevent such fatal mistakes for the future i humbly propose that a whistling academy be founded for the use of such gentry etc whether young or old as shall be judged properly qualified to be admitted members of this new musical society contributions for which will no doubt be cheerfully and liberally made by the innumerable persons of respectability who are at present continually

with a convivial party a few miles from town the following adventure happened  the cloth being removed and the glass beginning to circulate a man very slovenly as well as raggedly dressed introduced himself cap in hand to the company surprised at the conduct of our host in permitting such a person to intrude himself we were about to call in the landlord for an explanation when the man undertook to apologize for himself and exculpate the people of the house who he declared had not seen him enter  the singular impudence of the fellow added to the peculiar style of his address so superior to that of the vulgar excited our curiosity and we were anxious to be informed of the motives that could induce a person of his athletick form and youthful appearance to submit to the humiliating and precarious profession of a common beggar  an hereditary disorder gentlemen replied he which has brought several of our family to their graves even before they arrived at my age i have myself been discharged as incurable from every hospital appropriated to my malady this gentlemen obliges me to adopt this disagreeable method of supporting a miserable existence  but your complaint replied one of the company my delicacy gentlemen returned the mendicant will not permit me to disclose the nature of my disease in so public a manner but if any gentleman will retire with me into another apartment i doubt not that i shall give him such satisfaction as cannot fail to operate in my favor  it was accordingly agreed that a wag of the faculty should attend him into the next room who returning in a few minutes exclaimed with much apparent concern  poor fellow i do indeed recommend him as a real object of your benevolence and shall begin with subscribing a shilling for his relief the fellow then went round with his hat and the collection being pretty successful he retired uttering a thousand benedictions on the kindhearted gentlemen as soon as he was gone some of the company became very importunate with the young surgeon respecting the mans complaint which it was unanimously agreed he was now bound to reveal and as he was convinced that the fellow had by this time taken care to secure his retreat he immediately informed us that laziness was the incurable disease which had afflicted this man from his infancy that he gave him a shilling to open the subscription and that in fact we were all bit  infallible preservative against duelling by mr harrison the practice of duelling has of late become so frequent that most persons who have any brains to lose think it not at all unlikely if they mix much in what is called polite life that they may some day or other be deprived of them by a pistolbullet  for my own part i am one of those oldfashioned mortals who being convinced that they have none to spare are desirous of preserving what they have as long as possible and this disposition as my inclinations lead me a good deal into company has sometimes subjected me to considerable difficulties however as i have hitherto continued to sleep in a whole skin and am now nerly arrived at my first grand climacterick  an age when it may be supposed i need not be under any great apprehensione of being called out  a sketch of the manner in which i have so long preserved myself alike unwounded in person and eputation  i mean reputation for courage all other kinds of reputa ion being foreign to the present subject  may not be unserviceable to those who from motives similar to my own are led to mingle with society but who may occasionally feel themselves under some degree of constraint  a few years ago when duelling was much less fashionable than at present i happened to be at a coffeehouse where two young fellows both ensigns in the army sat discoursing of their preceding nights pretended amors in a style of such grossness and in tones of such vociferation that the company in general was greatly scandalized and a very decent young woman in particular who officiated in the bar and for whose ear it was evident their loose conversation was peculiarly intended blushed so immoderately and was so greatly confused that her situation pained me more than i can easily describe i waited a short time in expectation that some man of spirit would interfere for i am myself naturally averse to quarrelling but to my surprise though i could perceive the eye of the whole room were occasionally on the two striplings and most of them with looks of disgust when either of the obnoxious parties looked round for applause which they very often seemed to do many of the company were mean enough to assume a sort of grin of approcation and the rest to a man hastily turned away their heads this universal cowardice arouzed me i felt myself bold and a glow of conscious superiority animated my cheek i rose from my seat and took my station at the fire facing about to the youths who sat opposite and eyeing them with contempt the increased sternness of my visage soon attracted their attention it had probably not pleased them before and one of them after whispering the other had the audacity to address me with  sir i shall look as sulky as you do if you continue to stand before the fire  sir replied i you are an impertinent scoundrel and having grossly infulted the whole room with impunity you are i suppose beginning to offend every one individually  in an instant the heroes were both on their legs and a scene of confusion and altercation enfued easy to conceive but impossible to be expressed  it was insisted by the companion of him who had affronted me that i should submit to ask pardon of the gentleman whom i had denominated a scoundrel or meet him the next day in hyde park he appealed with great vehemence to the company if the word scoundrel was proper to be used by a gentleman or if any man of honor could tamely put up with the application of it to himself the extorted answer was almost universally  certainly not and it seemed the general opinion that the difference could only be accommodated in one of the ways proposed  elated with his success he turned to me with great serocity and demanded to know whether i chose to make the necessary concessions or to meet his friend in the field  i alike despise hastily returned i your friend and yourself and so far am i from acceding to your proposals or being convinced that i have bestowed an improper appellation on your infamous companion that i repeat he is a base scoundrel and that you are as shabby a rascal as himself  his sword was now out in a moment and though i was unarmed the dastardly villain actually made a lunge at me swearing bitterly that he would run me through the body if i did not immediately entreat his forgiveness but i snatched instantaneously the poker from the fire and with a single stroke shivered his sword at the same moment driving him to the wall by thrusting the redhot weapon close to his face which appeared evidently pale with fear notwithstanding the rubicund reflection of the poker in the mean time his companion was not idle but having likewise drawn he was advancing to salute me a posteriori when the company perceiving i was more likely to quiet the young sparks than they had at first dared to hope very manfully interposed and prevented the attack in my rear  having obliged the young gentleman to ask my pardon instend of my asking his under pain of a more intimate acquaintance with the still red poker i turned to the other who had by this time been compelled to deliver up his weapon and exacted from him a similar apology he however continued obstinately to refuse though every body was now clamorous against him till a slight application of the poker to his chin convinced him that i was not to be trifled with and he also acknowledged the impropriety of his behavior  as i was disgusted with the profusion of compliments which were now bestowed on my spirited conduct by the company i soon quitted the room and was the next day informed by a friend who happened to step in a short time after my depareure that the discomfited champions and all the company joined very cordially together in censuring the grossness of my behavior particularly my total disregard to good manners in the choice of my expressions  thus ended a business which seemed to threaten something more serious for though the young gentlemen protested vehemently that they would have their revenge whenever they should meet with me they took great care to avoid visiting every place where it was likely i might be found yet these youths were said to have actually seen service and to have each killed his man certain it is that they had for a long time overawed the company which usually frequented the coffeehouse where i accidentally encountered them and had totally driven away no inconsiderable number of customers  it would fill a volume of no contemptible size to recount minutely the various skirmishes in which i have at different times been engaged and yet if i know myself i am as much disposed to treat every one with civility and as studious in avoiding all occasions of offense as any person living  indeed i am not unwilling to believe that i am constitutionally what the world calls a coward for i really have never been able to discover in myself the pleasing sensation which some men of spirit seem to feel in taking a waiter by the nose or ears or kicking a footmans posterios for accidentally treading on my toes running against me on entering or quitting a room when i have chanced to stand in their way or any similar offense i may on such occasions have been prompted to use very intemperate language but i have usually been afterward weak enough to think that my resentment was even then more than adequate to the crime  but it will be said  what has this to do with duelling there is no danger at least for the present of being challenged by a waiter or footman i am afraid however that the same irascible spirit which leads a gentleman to delight in tweaking the nose of the former or kicking the breech of the latter will sometimes make him so far forget himself as to take a wrong pig by the ear  the inference is plain a man of spirit  that is one who has long enjoyed the supreme felicity of seeing every one approach him with fear and trembling  suddenly finding a strong opposition to his high behests ventures to try the force of personal threats he challenges his antagonist and borne up by that enthusiasm which is always denominated courage though it should sometimes have a very different appellation he goes to the field where he pronably leaves an existence which has too long been offensive to society  so far duelling may be said to be rather serviceable than prejudicial to mankind and if it always happened that the aggressor was not the survivor the practice would be much less liable to objection but for this material property i believe it is warmest advocates have not attempted to contend  i shall however avoid entering into the rationality of the custom of that every one who has common understanding is perhaps full as able to judge as myself and any arguments would be thrown away on persons of inferior capacity  i have already given some reasons for the suspicion i have ever entertained that i am myself naturally a coward i really never enjoyed personal contests for though when a lad i had now and then manual struggles for supetiority and was always fortunate enough to prove the victor i never engaged but with reluctance  this antipathy however to decisions by combat has never prevented me from giving my sentiments freely on any subject in whatever company i have fallen and though i am not wholly unacquainted with he art of verbal retreat it is perhaps the only species of defense i have ever been afraid of adopting  that i have from the various disputations in which i have been engaged received at least twenty challenges and more than twice as many menaces will not be greatly wondered at by those who know life when i inform them that i have now and then sat for a whole hour together with young sunaltern offiers both of the army and navy gamesters of all the different species fortunehunters men of gallantry great wits led captains and politicians indeed i doubt not that many young men of the town who associate constantly with such companions have at half my age had at least double the number  in extricating myself from these difficulties i have never once had occasion to apply for redress to the laws of my country though as they certainly are as well calculated to preserve the weak the infirm the aged and the meek from the personal insults of the stouter the younger and more turbulent as human sagacity can possibly contrive i should by no means have felt myself degraded by appealing to those institutions which were planned by our progenitors when national bravery was not at it is lowest ebb with much less folly and absurdity than seems to be generally imagined by their abundantly wise successors had no quicker and equally efficacious remedies presented themselves  i have constantly found that the most boisterous heroes have been soon tranquilized when they were once thoroughly convinced that a man would not fight fair for though after positively refusing a challenge i have been often violently threatened with personal chastisement on my giving the parties to understand that i was not very delicate in my choice of weapons their menaces which i always treated with the most resolute defiance were seldom attempted to be put in execution once indeed a young hibernian raised his cane which was intended to salute my head or shoulders but on my seizing a candlestick which stood before me he thought proper to defer the discharge of his anger till he met with one who was less disposed to make him a suitable return  if this method be invariably pursued with becoming resolution it will i apprehend prove to others as it has long done to me an infallible preservative against duelling  substitute for the dogtax in a letter from farmer truemans towzer to squire heavisides ponto dear ponto i went home with philis the parsons speckled bitch last tuesday and to my great amazement i heard the doctor declare that there is actually a scheme on foot to tax us poor dogs the consequence of which will be that three parts in four of our species will be knocked on the head i profess i am not in any dread for myself nor for you my dear ponto for our usefulness will preserve us since men though they are by far the most ungrateful of all other animals seldom choose to destroy what is of real benefit to themselves i am not therefore alarmed out of any selfish view no it is a noble spirit of patriotism that inflames me and though i say it there is not a dog in the nation that will fight more desperately or bark louder in a good cause than your old friend towzer let your sneaking puppies follow low mercenary views let them wag their tails at every scoundrel and nuzzle in dunghills for hall a bone i am a british mastiff and scorn such paltry actions i will venture to say that almighty love itself cannot make me do a little thing and though i like a pretty bitch as well as another dog yet it is not in the power of the most charming of that bewitching sex either by day to make me kill a neighbors sheep or by night to desert my post and leave my masters house unguarded but why all these professions of honesty to me my ponto will say who have had long experience of towzers worth and imtegrity true but at this conjuncture it is highly requisite thou should think the best of me since i am about to engage thee in an affair the seriousness and importance of which cannot be too strictly atended to and the greater opinion thou have of the proposer with the more alacrity will thou enter on the affair  one must be a stupid dog indeed not to know that notwithstanding our almost innumerable taxes the ministry want money damnably therefore this act will certainly take place unless we can start some other scheme from which more cole may be expected such a scheme i have in my head but i am sensible is not to be brought to bear without thy assistance  thy intimacy with miss biddys lapdog will forward thee in the way that i shall chalk out to thee thou must engage shock to communicate my proposals to his fair mistress and at the same time back them with his interest and if she stands our friend we have nothing to fear for sir nathan nimbletongue the member for the county is her slave and she has a pair of eyes that would dazzle a roman senate into blindness to the common cause and corrupt the integrity of a cato i have enclosed a copy of the scheme and rest ever thine most affectionately  towzer towzers scheme for a polltax on that part of the human species who are distinguished by the appellations of sad dogs lazy dogs and puppies   the family of the sad dogs has ever been reckoned without controversy the most ancient and most numerous of any in the kingdom if therefore they were taxed at the easy rate of one shilling per head they would bring in to the government annually at least four hundred thousand pounds sterling    the lazy dogs are those expletives of nature which seem only formed to devour her works and prevent her from being burdensome to herself with her own exuberancy and would at sixpence a head produce the same sum at least    and lastly the puppies that is to say the numerous tribe of fops coxcombs witlings pedants poetasters criticasters and grammaticasters with many more of that strain would at threepence a puppy bring in at an average the same sum so there will be one million two hundred pounds sterling by these means redound from a soil which has hitherto brought forth nothing but has been buried in the weeds of corruption and the dearth of barrenness    the kings cousin and counselor an anecdote of george ii and the earl of chesterfield soon after the late earl of chesterfield was made a member of the cabinet a place of great trust became vacant to which the earl and the duke of dorset recommended two very different persons his majesty contended for his own recommendation with much warmth and finding he was not likely to succeed he left the council chamger in great anger protesting that he would be obeyed the king being retired a violent contest ensued but at length it was carried against him lest he should expect the same implicit obedience on other occasions when it might rise into a dangerous precedent the difficulty now was who should wait on the king in his present humor with the grant of the office for his signature a task which fell to the lot of lord chesterfield as his lordship expected to find the king very little disposed to execute the business he prudently took care not to incense him by abruptly making the request but asked in accents of great humility with whose name his majesty would be pleased to have the blanks filled up with the devils answered the king with all the vehemence of passion and will your majesty coolly replied the earl permit the instrument to run as usual  our trusty and wellbeloved cousin and counselor the king laughing very heartily immediately put his hand to the appointment and related to every body the success with which the noble earls wit had attacked his illhumour  apology for corporeal cowardice a military anecdote a gascon soldier being asked by his comrade what made him tremble so excessively

the squire it shant be done and to the parlour pushed him on to all around he nods and scrapes nor waitingmaid nor butler scapes with often bidding takes his seat but at a distance mighty great though often asked to draw his chair he nods nor comes an inch more near by madam served with body bended with knife and fork and arms extended he reached as far as he was able to plate that overhung the table with little morsels cheats his chops and in the passage much he drops to show where most his heart inclined he talked and drank to john behind when drank to in the modish way your loves

scholard varsd in letters i knaws my duty to my betters much mirth the farmers ways afford and hearty laughs go round the board thus the first course was ended  well but at the next  ah what befell the dishes now were timely placed and table with fresh luxry graced when drank to by a neighboring charmer up as was usual stands the farmer a wag to carry on the joke thus to his servant softly spoke  come hither dick step gently there and pull away the farmers chair it is done his congee made the clown draws back and stoops to sit him down but by posteriors overweighd and of his trusty seat betrayed as men at twigs in river sprawling he caught the cloth to save his falling in vain  sad fortune down he wallowd and rattling all the dishes followed the foplings lost their little wits the

squeaks miss dolly i will pink his soul out roars a bully at this the farmer shrinks for fear and thinking twas ill tarrying here shabs off and cries  aye kill me then whenever you catch me here again so home he jogs and leaves the squire to cool the sparks and ladies ire thus ends my tale and now i will try like prior something to apply this may teach rulers of a nation never to place men above their station and this may show the wanton wit that while he bites he may be bit the test of patience or the hogs in the parsons cellar a parson who had a remarkable foible in minding the bottle much more than the bible was deemed by his neighbors to be less perplexed in handling a tankard than handling a text perched up in his pulpit one sunday he cried  make patience my dearly beloved your guide and in all your trouble mischances and crosses remember the patience of job in his losses now this parson had got a stout cask of strong beer a present no doubt  but no matter from where suffice it to say that he reckoned it good and valued the liquor as much as his blood while he the church service in haste muttered over the hogs found their way through the old cellar door and by the sweet scent of the beerbarrel led had knocked out the spigot or cock from it is head out spouted the liquor abroad on the ground and the unbidden guests quaffd it merrily round nor from their diversion or merriment ceased till every hog there was a true drunken beast and now the grave lecture and prayers at an end he brings along with him a neighboring friend to be a partaker of sundays good cheer and taste his delightful octoberbrewd beer the dinner was ready and all things laid snug  here wife says the parson go fetch up a mug but a mug of what liquor he would scarce time to tell her when  lord husband she cried there is the hogs in the cellar to be sure they have got in whilst we were at prayers  to be sure youre a fool so get you down stairs and bring what i bid you  go see what is the matter for now i myself hear a grunting and clatter she went and returning with sorrowful face in suitable phrases related the case he raved like a madman and snatching a broom first belabourd his hogs then his wife rund the room was ever poor mortal so pestered as i with a base slut who keeps all my house like a stye how came you to have your damned hogs in the kitchen is that a fit place to keep cattle you bitch in  lord husband said she what a coil you keep here about a poor beggarly barrel of beer you should in your troubles mischances and crosses remember the patience of job in his

hung dangling deep with blue the vineyard ripe a day serene now calls them all to work again the fauns through every furrow shoot and load their flaskets with the fruit and now the vintage early trod

vii the idle prentice returned from sea and in a carret with a common prostitute while the preceding print represents the good youth rewarded by the possession of a virtuous woman in the present appears the sad contrast of his profligate fellowapprentice associated with one of those wretched outcasts of society who disgrace not only their sex but human nature with this loathsome being the tenant of a miserable garret he is now seen in bed he may be supposed to have deserted from the seaservice in consequence of the severe chastisement to which his idleness his vices and perhaps his cowardice  for the most profligate are by no means the most brave  have there continually subjected him the mode of life which he has subsequently pursued is sufficiently demonstrated by the pistols and other implements of the robbers trade as well as by the watches and trinkets which form his booty or rather that of the artful prostitute with whom he has formed the illicit connection this wretch whose filthy and diseased state is implied by the gallipot and phials on the mantlepiece surveys with composure a rich earring part of the precious spoil while her paramour conscious of the guilt by which it was obtained and in momentary dread of pursuing justice starts up petrified with horror on the falling of some loose bricks down the crazy chimney over which a cat was passing and is at the same time headlong precipitated the expression of the two faces affords an admirable characteristick contrast the harlot partakes not like a virtuous woman in whatever may alarm the man who takes her to his bosom but constantly meditates on the means of attaining the to utmost benefit herself his joys are not her joys nor his griefs her griefs  though this print is by no means crowded with objects

children in answer to all which questions slipping off his shoe he held it up and interrogated them in his turn  is not this shoe said he a very handsome one is it not quite new is it not extremely well made how then is it that none of you can tell me where it pinches  the modern man of honor those who attack the fundamental laws of virtue and morality urge the uncertainty of them and allege their variations in different countries and even in different ages in the same countries morality say they is local and consequently an imaginary thing since what is rejected in one climate as a vice is practiced in another as a virtue and according to them the voice of nature speaks as many different languages as there are nations in the world  the dangers and ill consequences of this doctrine are obvious but surely the falsity of it is not less so and the most charitable opinion one can entertain of those who propagate it is that they mistake fashion and custom for nature and reason the invariable laws of justice and morality are the first and universal emanations of human reason while unprejudiced and uncorrupted and we may as well say that sickness is the natural state of the body as that injustice and immorality are the natural situation of the mind we contract most of the distempers of the one by the irregularity of our appetites and of the other by yielding to the impetuosity of our passions but in both cases reason when consulted speaks a different language  i admit that the prevailing customs and fashions of most countries are not founded on reason and on the contrary are too frequently repugnant to it but then the reasonable people of those countries contemn and abhor them though it may be they too wittingly comply with or at least have not courage openly enough to oppose them  the people of rank and distinction in every country are properly called the people of fashion because in truth they settle the fashion instead of subjecting themselves to the laws they take measure of their own appetites and passions and then make laws to fit them which laws though neither sounded in justice nor enacted by a legal authority too often prevail over and insult both justice and authority this is fashion  in this light i have often considered the word honor in it is fashionable acceptance in this country and must confess that were that the universal meaning of it throughout this kingdom it would very much confirm the doctrine i endeavor to confute and would be so contrary to that honor which reason justice and commonsense point out that i should not wonder if it inclined people to call in question the very existence of honor itself  the character of a man of honor as received in the beau monde is something so very singular that it deserves a particular examination and though easier observed than described i shall endeavor to give my readers a description of it illustrated with some original pieces which have luckily fallen into my hands  a man of honor is one who peremptorily affirms himself to be so and who will cut any bodys throat that questions it though on the best grounds he is infinitely above the restraints which the laws of god or man lay on vulgar minds and knows no other ties than those of honor of which word he is to be the sole expounder he must strictly adhere to a party denomination though he may be utterly regardless of it is principles his expense should exceed his income considerably not for the necessaries but for the superfluities of life that the debts he contracts may do him honor there should be a haughtiness and insolence in his deportment which is supposed to result from conscious honor if he be choleric and wrongheaded into the bargain with a good deal of animal courage he acquires the glorious character of a man of nice and jealous honor and if all these qualifications are duly seasoned with the genteelest vices the man of honor is complete any thing his wife children servants or tradesmen may think to the contrary notwithstanding  belville is allowed to be a man of the most consummate honor that this or any other age ever produced the men are proud of his acquaintance and the women of his protection his party glories in being countenanced by him and his honor is frequently quoted as a sanction for their conduct but some original letters which i shall give my readers will let them more intimately into the particulars of so shining a character than mere description would do  he had run out a considerable fortune by a life of pleasure particularly by gaming and being delicately scrupulous in points of honor he writ the following letter to his attorney after an ill run at play   sir i had a damned tumble last night at hazard and must raise a thousand within a week get it me on any terms for i would rather suffer the greatest encumbrance on my fortune than the least blemish on my honor as for those clamorous rascals the tradesmen insist on my privilege and keep them off as long as possible we may chance to ruin some of them before they can bring us to trial your etc  to mr goosetree attorney in furnivals inn belville   but lest the endeavors of mr goosetree should prove ineffectual belville from the same principle of honor resolved at all events to secure that sum collaterally and therefore wrote the following letter to the first minister   sir i was applied to yesterday in your name by  to vote for the great point which is to come into our house tomorrow but as it was extremely contrary to my opinion and principles i gave him no explicit answer but took some time to consider of it i have therefore the honor now to acquaint you that i am determined to give my concurrence to this affair but must desire at the same time that you will immediately send  to me with the fifteen hundred pounds he offered me yesterday and for which i have a pressing occasion this morning i am persuaded you know me too well to scruple this payment beforehand and that you will not be the first person that ever questioned the honor of sir your most faithful humble servant  belville   i find another letter of the same date to a lady who appears to be the wife of his most intimate friend   my dear i have just now received yours and am very sorry for the uneasiness your husbands behavior has given you of late though i cannot be of your opinion that he suspects our connection we have been bred up together from children and have lived in the strictest friendship ever since so that i dare say he would as soon suspect me of a design to murder as wrong him this way and you know it is to that considence and security of his that i owe the happiness that i enjoy however in all events be convinced that you are in the hands of a man of honor who will not suffer you to be ill used and should my friend proceed to any disagreeable extremities with you depend on it i will cut the cuckolds throat for him yours most tenderly  b    the fourth and last letter is to a friend who had probably as high notions of honor as himself by the nature of the affair in which he requires his assistance   dear charles prythee come to me immediately to serve me in an affair of honor you must know i told a damned lie last night in a mixed company and a formal odd dog in a manner insinuated that i did so on which i whispered him to be in hyde park this morning and to bring a friend with him if he had such a thing in the world the booby was hardly worth my resentment but you know my delicacy where honor is concerned yours  belville   it appears from these authentic pieces that mr belville filled with the noblest sentiments of honor paid all debts but his just ones kept his word scrupulously in the flagitious sale of his conscience to a minister was ready to protect at the expense of his friends life his friends wife whom by the opportunities that friendship had given him he had corrupted and punished truth with death when it intimated however justly the want of it in himself  this person of refined honor conscious of his own merit and virtue is a most unmerciful censor of the lesser vices and failings of others and lavishly bestows the epithets of scoundrel and rascal on all those who in a subordinate rank of life seem to aspire to any genteel degree of immorality an awkward country gentleman who sells his silent vote cheap is with him a sad dog the industrious tradesmen are a pack of cheating rascals who should be better regulated and not suffered to impose on people of condition and servants are a parcel of idle scoundrels that ought to be used ill and not paid their wages in order to check their insolence  it is not to be imagined how pernicious the example of such a creature is to society he is admired and consequently imitated he not only immediately corrupts his own circle of acquaintance but the contagion spreads itself to infinity as circles in water produce one another though gradually less marked out in proportion as they are remoter from the cause of the first  to such practice and such examples in higher life may justly be imputed the general corruption and immorality which prevail through this kingdom but when such is the force of fashion and when the examples of people of the first rank in a country are so prevalent as to dignify vice and immorality in spite of all laws divine and human how popular might they make virtue if they would exert their power in it is cause and how must they in their cooler moments reproach themselves when they come to reflect that by their fatal examples they have beggared corrupted and it may be enslaved a whole nation  the pluralists dinner or the curate a match for the dean a dean of canterbury remarkable for holding a great number of churchpreferments traveling slowly in his chariot to that city was overtaken by a poor parson who had procured the loan of a good horse the parson en passant bowed most respectfully to the dean who desiring him to stop begged he would call at the mermaid at rochester and order him a dinner to be ready at a certain hour the parson accordingly called on the host and told him that he would be honored with a visit at such a time and must provide a good dinner for how many and please your honor says boniface  why replies the parson i cannot well say how many persons the whole company will consist of for i only saw the dean of canterbury the canon of winchester the provost of litchfield the rector of orpington the vicar of romney and one of the kings chaplains  the parson then proceeded to his own home which was within a few miles and the landlord began to make ample provision for the numerous guests he expected to entertain accordingly when the dean arrived a large table was spread and the cloth laid how is this cries his reverence you have shown me the wrong room this surely is intended for a large company  and pleasure your honor replied the landlord parson singlechurch called about an hour and a half ago and told me i must provide for your honor and the canon of winchester and the provost of litchfield and the rector of orpington and one of the kings chaplains too and i dont know how many more and so i thought and please your honor i would get enough  oh very well coolly answered the dean who now recollected himself i ought to have asked mr singlechurch to have staid and dined with me  spoiled children a mirror for mothers i am engaged in a visit at a friends house in the country where i promised myself much satisfaction i have however been greatly disappointed in my expectations for on my arrival i found a house full of children who are humoured beyond measure and indeed absolutely spoiled by the ridiculous indulgence of a fond mother this unlucky circumstance has subjected me to many inconveniences and as i am a man of a grave reserved disposition has been a perpetual source of embarrassment and perplexity  the second day of my visit in the midst of dinner the eldest boy who is eight years old whipped off my perriwig with great dexterity and received the applause of the table for his humor and spirit this lad when he has reached his fourteenth year and is big enough to lie without the maid is to be sent to a school in the neighborhood which has no other merit than that of being but seven miles off six of the children are permitted to sit at table who entirely monopolize the wings of fowls and the most delicate morsels of every dish because the mother has discovered that her children have not strong stomachs  in the morning before my friend is up i generally take a turn on the gravelwalk where i could wish to enjoy my own thoughts without interruption but i am here instantly attended by my little tormentors who follow me backwards and forwards and play at what they call running after the gentleman my whip which was a present from an old friend has been lashed to pieces by one of the boys who is fond of horses and the handle is turned into a hobbyhorse the mainspring of my repeatingwatch has been broke in the nursery which at the mothers request i had lent to the youngest boy who was just breeched and who cried to wear it  the mothers attention to the children entirely destroys all conversation and once as an amusement for the evenings we attempted to begin reading tom jones but were interrupted in the second page by little sammy who is suffered to whip his top in the parlour i am known to be troubled with violent headaches notwithstanding which another of the boys without notice given or any regard paid to the company is permitted to break out into the brayings of an ass for which the strength of his lungs is commended and a little miss at breakfast is allowed to drink up all the cream and put her singers into the sugardish because she was once sickly i am teazed with familiarities which i can only repay with a frown and pestered with the petulance of ludicrous prattle in which i am unqualified to join it is whispered in the family that i am a mighty good sort of a man but that i cannot talk to children nor am i the only person who suffers from this folly a neighboring clergyman of great merit and modesty and much acquainted in the family has received hints to forbear coming to the house because little sukey always cries when she sees him and has told her mamma she cannot bear that ugly parson  mrs qualm my friends wife the mother of this hopeful offspring is perpetually breeding or rather her whole existence is spent in a series of greatbellies lyingsin visitings churchings and christenings every transaction of her life is dated from her several pregnancies the grandmother and the manmidwife a serious sensible man constantly reside in the house to be always ready on these solemn occasions she boasts that no family has ever sent out more numerous advertisements for nurses with a fine breast of milk as her longings have of late been in the vegetable way the garden is cultivated for this purpose alone and totally filled with forward peace and melonglasses in hopes that she may luckily long for what is at hand she preserves to the utmost the prerogative of frequent pregnancy and conscious of the dignity and importance of being often big exerts an absolute authority over her husband he was once a keen foxhunter but has long ago dropped his hounds his wife having remonstrated that his early rising disturbed the family unseasonably and having dreamed that he broke his leg in leaping a ditch  i revere mrs qualm as the mother and only wish i could recommend her as the manager of children i hope this letter may fall into her hands to convince her how absurd it is to suppose that others can be as much interested in her own children as herself i would teach her that what i complain of as matter of inconvenience may one day prove to her a severe trial and that early licentiousness will at last mock that parental affection from whose mistaken indulgence it arose  the misers mistake or all covet all lose a miser having lost a hundred pounds promised ten pounds reward to any one who should bring it him an honest poor man who found it brought it to the old gentleman demanding the ten pounds but the miser to baffle him alleged there were a hundred and ten pounds in the bag when lost the poor man however was advised to sue for the money and when the cause came on to be tried it appearing that the seal had not been broken nor the bag ripped the judge said to the defendants counsel  the bag you lost had a hundred and ten pounds in it you say  yes my lord says he then replied the judge according to the evidence given in court this cannot be the money for here were only a hundred pounds therefore the plaintiff must keep it till the true owner appears  humorous description of a citizen and his family at vauxhall i was greatly diverted last saturday evening at vauxhall with the shrewd remarks of an honest citizen whose wife and two daughters had prevailed on him to carry them to the garden as i thought there was something curious in their behavior i went into the next box to them where i had an opportunity of seeing and overhearing every thing that passed  after some talk   come come said the old don it is time i think to go to supper to this the ladies readily assented and one of the misses said   do let us have a chick papa   zounds said the father they are half a crown apiece and no bigger than a sparrow here the old lady took him up   you are so stingy mr rose there is no bearing you when one is out upon pleasure i love to appear like somebody and what signifies a few shillings once and away when a body is about it this reproof so effectually silenced the old gentleman that the youngest miss had the courage to put in a word for some ham likewise the waiter was called and dispatched by the old lady with an order for a chicken and a plate of ham when it was brought our honest cit twirled the dish about three or four times and surveyed it with a very settled countenance then taking up a slice of ham and dangling it to and fro on the end of his fork asked the waiter how much there was of it a shillings worth sir said the fellow   prythee said the don how much do think it weighs   an ounce   a shilling an ounce that is sixteen shillings per pound  a reasonable profit truly  let me see  suppose now the whole ham weighs thirty pounds at a shilling per ounce that is sixteen shillings per pound why your master makes exactly twentyfour pounds of every ham and if he buys them at the best hand and salts them and cures them himself they dont stand him in ten shillings apiece the old lady bade him hold his nonsense declared herself ashamed for him and asked him if people must not live the taking a colored handkerchief from her own neck she tucked it into his shirtcollar whence it hung like a bid and helped him to a leg of the chicken the old gentleman at every bit he put into his mouth amused himself with saying   there goes twopence  there goes threepence  there goes a groat zounds a man at these places should not have a swallow so wide as a tomtit  this scanty repast we may imagine was soon dispatched and it was with much difficulty our citizen was prevailed on to suffer a plate of beef to be ordered this too was no less admired and underwent the same comments with the ham at length when only a very small bit was left as they say for manners in the dish our don took a piece of an old newspaper out of his pocket and gravely wrapping up the meat in it placed it carefully in his lettercase i will keep thee as a curiosity to my dying day and i will show thee to my neighbor horseman and ask him if he can make as much of his steaks then rubbing his hands and shrugging up his shoulders  why now says he tomorrow night i may eat as much cold beef as i can stuff in any tavern in london and pay nothing for it a dish of tarts cheesecakes and custards next made their appearance at the request of the young ladies who paid no sort of regard to the sathers remonstrance that they were four times as dear as at the pastrycooks  supper being ended madam put her spouse in mind to call for wine we must have some wine my dear or we shall not be looked upon you know  well well says the don that is right enough but do they sell their liquor too by the ounce  here drawer what wine have you got the fellow who by this time began to smoke his guests answered  we have exceeding good french wine of all sorts and please your honor would your honor have a bottle of champagne or burgundy or claret or   no no none of your wishywashy outlandish rotgut for me interrupted the citizen a tankard of the alderman beats all the red claret wine in the french kings cellar  but come bring us a bottle of sound old port and do you hear let it be good  while the waiter was gone the good man most sadly lamented that he could not have his pipe which the wife would not allow because she said it was ungenteel to smoke where any ladies were in company when the wine came our citizen gravely took up the bottle and holding it above his head  aye aye said he the bottom has had a good kick  and mind how confoundedly it is pinched on the sides  not above five gills i warrant an old soldier at the jerusalem would beat two of them but let us see how it is brewed he then poured out a glass and after holding it up before the candle smelling to it sipping it twice or thrice and smacking his lips drank it off but declaring that second thoughts were best he filled another bumper and tossing that off after some pause with a very important air ventured to pronounce it drinkable the ladies having also drank a glass round affirmed it was very good and felt warm in the stomach and even the old gentleman relaxed into such good humor by the time the bottle was emptied that out of his own free will and motion he most generously called for another pint but charged the waiter to pick out an honest one  while the glass was thus circulating the family amused themselves with making observations on the garden the citizen expressed his wonder at the number of lamps and said it must cost a great deal of money every night to light them all the eldest miss declared that for her part she liked the dark walk best of all because it was solentary little miss thought the last song mighty pretty and said she would buy it if she could but carry home the tune and the old lady observed that there was a great deal of good company indeed but the gentlemen were so rude that they perfectly put her out of countenance by staring at her through their spyglasses in a word the tarts the cheesecakes the beef the chicken the ounce of ham and every thing seemed to have been quite forgot till the dismal moment approached when the reckoning was called for as this solemn business concerns only the gentlemen the ladies kept a profound silence and when the terrible account was brought they left the paymaster undisturbed to enjoy the misery by himself only the old lady had the hardiness to squint at the sumtotal and declared it was pretty reasonable considering  our citizen bore his misfortunes with a tolerable degree of patience he shook his head as he runover every article and swore he would never buy meat by the ounce again at length when he had carefully summed up every figure he bade the drawer bring change for sixpence then pulling out a leathern purse from a snug pocket in the inside of his waistcoat he drew out slowly piece by piece thirteen shillings which he regularly placed in two rows on the table when the change was brought after counting it very carefully he laid down four halfpence in the same exact order then calling the waiter  there says he there is your damage  thirteen and twopence  and hearkye there is threepence over for yourself the remaining penny he put into his coatpocket and chinking it  this says he will serve me tomorrow to buy a paper of tobacco  the family now prepared themselves for going and as there were some slight drops of rain madam buttoned up the old gentlemans coat that he might not spoil his laced waistcoat and made him flap his hat over which she tied his pockethandkerchief to save his wig and as the coat itself she said had never been worn but three sundays she even parted with her own cardinal and spread it the wrong side out over his shoulders in these accoutrements he sallied forth accompaned by his wife with her upperpetticoat thrown over her head and his daughters with the skirts of their gowns turned up and their heads muffled up in colored handkerchiefs i followed them quite out of the garden and as they were waiting for their hack to draw up the youngest miss asked  when shall we come again papa  come again said he what a pox would you ruin me once in ones life is enough and i think i have done very handsome why it would not have cost me above fourpencehalfpenny to have spent my evening at sots hole and what with the cursed coachhire and all together here is almost a pound gone and nothing to show for it  fie mr rose i am quite ashamed for you replies the old lady you are always grudging me and your girls the least bit of pleasure and you cannot help grumbling if we do but go to little hornsey to drink tea i am sure now they are women grown up they ought to see a little of the world and they shall the old don was not willing to pursue the argument any farther and the coach coming up he was glad to put an end to the dispute by saying  come come let us make haste wife or we shall not get home time enough to have my best wig combed out again and tomorrow you know is sunday  colley cibbers wager cibber was engaged in a paper war with pope and being told one day that pope intended to prosecute him for making too free with his character cibber happened to be in a peevish temper and replied  he may kiss my arse on this one of his friends who were all on the banter observed that it was not language for a gentleman and that he was sure that cibber would not dare say so to popes face  by god sir says colley i would tell him so or any puppy that should take his part  this assertion was what they were fishing for as they now perceived that he was in a right cue to be worked up to any pitch and so it proved for before they parted they provoked him to a bett of one hundred guineas that he would bid pope kiss his arse in the public playhouse bid the company he sat with kiss his arse let them be who they would bid box pit and gallery separately kiss his arse likewise and in conclusion bid the whole house kiss his arse all together this mad wager soon got wind and it was generally known that pope was to be at the play the next night when the time came the house was crowded now as it was the beginning of term the solicitor and attorney general were both in the stagebox according to an ancient custom and who should be perched plump between them but alexander the little well colley had bought the collar and he was resolved to go through with it so just as the last music was playing and the curtain ready to be drawn up he rang the bell and pushed boldly on the stage cibber bowed the house clapped he bowed again all was attention and thus he began  ladies and gentlemen i have a story to tell you to which if you do not honor me with an indulgent hearing i shall lose one hundred guineas on this a universal clap ensued and a general cry of  the story the story he then proceeded thus  you must know ladies and gentlemen that there lived in this city an honest old trenchermaker who had saved a very considerable fortune and having two sons called kill em all and kiss my arse he left all his landed estate to his eldest son kill em all and all his business and stock in trade to his youngest son kiss my arse now it happened ladies and gentlemen that kill em all in a few years prodigally spent his patrimony and what does he do but set up his business of trenchermaking directly under the nose of his brother kiss my arse it is an old saying that two of a trade can never agree and i am sure it is a true one for no sooner was this opposition began than the two brothers began to hate the sight of each other so that if they both chanced to be at the play on the same night you would see kill em all in the pit and kiss my arse in the gallery or else kill em all in the gallery and kiss my arse in the pit indeed sometimes you might see kill em all in the pit or gallery and kiss my arse in the boxes by and by they got into a paper war but as neither of them could write themselves they employed scribblers on each side to do it for them so kill em all chose your humble servant and kiss my arse mr pope bowing to him soon after the commencement of the paper war they went to law with each other about defamation kill em all chose for counsel the solicitorgeneral and kiss my arse mr attorney general no i mistake kill em all chose the attorney general and kiss my arse mr solicitor bowing occasionally to both at last by the interposition of friends they agreed to submit to an arbitration and then it was finally settled that to obviate all subsequent disputes kill em all is trenchers should for the future be made all square and those of kiss my arse all round  this piece of humor was received with great applause and cibber fairly won his wager  politeness or the catoninetails a tale by mr john martin once on a time as i have heard say  i neither know the year nor day  the rain distilled from many a cloud the night was dark the wind blew loud a country squire without a guide where roads were bad and heath was wide attended by his servant jerry was traveling toward the town of bury the squire had never been bred in courts and yet was held as fame reports though he to wit made no pretense a squire of more than common sense jerry who courage could not boast thought every sheep he saw a ghost and most devoutly prayed he might escape the terrors of that night as they approached the commons side a peasants cottage they espied there riding up our weary squire held it most prudent to enquire being nothing less than wet to skin where he might find a wholesome inn no inns there are replied the clown twixt this and yonder market town seven miles norwest across the heath and wind and rain are in your teeth but if so be sir you will go to yon old hall upon the brow you will find free entertainment there down beds and rare old english fare of beef and mutton fowl and fish as good as any man need wish warm stabling too and corn and hay yet not a penny will you pay it is true sir i have heard it said  and here he grinnd and scratched his head  the gentleman that keeps the house though every freedom he allows and is oernight so woundy civil you would swear he never dreamt of evil orders next morn his servant john with catoninetails to lay on full twenty strokes most duly counted on man and master ere they are mounted with catoninetails oh cried jerry that i were safe at edmunds bury our squire spurred on as clown directed this offer might not be rejected poor jerrys prayers could not dissuade the squire more curious than afraid arrives and rings the footman runs the master with his wife and sons descend the hall and bid him enter give him dry clothes and beg he will venture to take a glass of coniack brandy and he who hated words to bandy in idle complimentry speeches the brandy took and eke the breeches the liquor drank the garments changed the family round the fire arrangd the mistress begged to know if he chose coffee chocolate or tea the squire replied sans hesitation or teazing trite expostulation  a dish of coffee and a toast the mistress smiled the enraptured host cried  sir i like your frankness much this house is yours pray think it such while here you stay it is my request and you shall be a welcome guest sans ceremony i would live and what i have i freely give tea ended once again our host demanded  sir of boiled or roast fish flesh or fowl do you prefer for supper  why indeed good sir roast duck i love  with good green pease  yes dearest madam if you please well said now while it is getting ready we two my eldest son and lady will take a hand at whist  agreed and soon they cut for deal and lead but now to crimp my lengthened tale whether the squire drank wine or ale or how he slept or what he said or how much gave to man or maid or what the while became of jerry among footmen blithe and maidens merry description here we cannot admit for brevitys the soul of wit suffice to say the morn arrived jerry of senses half deprived horses from stable saw led out trembled and skulkd and peerd about and felt already every thwack of catoninetails on his back each word each action was a blunder but o how great his joy and wonder the stirrups held the horses crossed when forth the hostess and the host with smiles instead of lashes smarting came out to take a cup at parting bestowing a thousand welcomes on em unfeigned for all the honor done em of thanks what language could afford of catoninetails not one word mutual civilities repaid the squire had turned his horses head to gallop off yet his desire grew every moment higher and higher while bidding thus his last adieu to ask if what he would heard were true for not alone the clown had said the reckoning must in stripes be paid but one of the footmen whom he slily over night interrogated drily confirmed the aforesaid peasants tale and said his master would not fail next morn to bid in furious passion strong john lay twenty times the lash on determined then to ease his doubt even though it bred a flogging bout  of that however to be sincere he was not very much in fear  once more he turned his horses head and to his host thus smiling said  last night a peasant told me here as i have found was noble cheer but added ere this morn i went you would drub me to my hearts content yet this you have not put in act is it a fiction or a fact after the kindness you have expressed you take your leave thus of each guest and how if still a rule you have kept it have i deserved to be excepted  sir answered he it is very true no stranger ever went hence but you who bore not on his well carved bark of catoninetails many a mark none yet deserved or i am mistaken that i should spare the blockheads bacon a set of tiresome troublesome knaves of bowing fawning lying slaves if a man asked what they would prefer  oh i love any thing good sir would you choose coffee sir or tea dear maam it is all the same to me for beef or mutton give your voice  upon my honor i have no choice there is cheshire sir and gloucester cheese which shall i send you  which you please curse on their cringing complaisance i have tutored some of them to dance such steps as they never learned in france but you good sir or i misdeem deserve an honest mans esteem your frankness sir i call polite i never spnt a happier night and whensoeer this road you come i hope you will make my house your home nay more i likewise hope henceforth to rank a man of so much worth among my friends  sir said the squire it is what i ardently desire not twenty miles from hence my house at which your sons yourself and spouse shall find such hospitality as kindly here you have shown to me the bargain struck the squire and jerry again proceed for town of bury and now the reader may with ease extract this moral if he please politeness cannot ever become impertinent and troublesome his breeding good he soonest proves who soonest tells you what he loves and who in rapid eloquence their wordy compliments dispense have more civility than sense the cits country box by mr robert lloyd the wealthy cit grown old

slouching gait with hobnails fortified his feet he struck a light along the street now stationd at a ludgate door the natty prig succeeds the boor like spigot in a cask of beer the dawnings of a tail

fishwoman who was accustomed to charge her veins rather too freely with her favorite whisky having been one day blooded the apothecary told her that her blood was very bad by jasus says she mr doctor but it is a great big lie for i was always reckoned to have the best blood of any woman in the parish  the art of eartickling human nature though every where the same is so seemingly diversified by the various habits and customs of different countries and so blended with the early impressions we receive from our education that they are often confounded together and mistaken for one another this makes us look with astonishment upon all customs that are extremely different from our own and hardly allow those nations to be of the same nature with ourselves if they are unlike us in their manners whereas all human actions may be traced up to these two great motives the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain and upon a strict examination we shall often find that those customs which at first view seem the most different from our own have in reality a great analogy with them  what more particularly suggested this thought to me was an account which a gentleman who was lately returned from china gave in a company where i happened to be present of a pleasure held in high esteem and extremely practiced by that luxurious nation he told us that the tickling of the ears was one of the most exquisite sensations known in china and that the delight administered to the whole frame through this organ could by an able and skilful tickler be raised to whatever degree of ecstasy the patient should desire  the company struck with this novelty expressed their surprise as is usual on such occasions first by a silly silence and then by many silly questions the account too coming so far as from china raised both their wonder and their curiosity much more than if it had come from any european country and opened a larger field for pertinent questions among others the gentleman was asked whether the chinese ears and fingers had the least resemblance to ours to which having answered in the affirmative he went on thus i peceive i have excited your curiosity so much by mentioning a custom unknown to you here that i believe it will not be disagreeable if i give you a particular account of it  this pleasure strange as it may seem to you is in china reckoned almost equal to any that the senses afford there is not an ear in the whole country untickled and the ticklers have in their turn others who tickle them insomuch that there is a circulation of tickling throughout that vast empire and if by chance there be some few unhappy enough not to find ticklers or some ticklers clumsy enough not to find business they comfort themselves at least with selftitillation  this profession is one of the most lucrative and considerable ones in china the most eminent performers being either handsomely requited in money or still better rewarded by the credit and influence it gives them with the party tickled insomuch that a mans fortune is made as soon as he gets to be tickler to any considerable mandarine  the emperor as in justice he ought enjoys this pleasure in it is highest perfection and all the considerable people contend for the honor and advantage of this employment the person who succeeds the best in it being always the first favorite and chief dispenser of his imperial power the principal mandarines are allowed to try their hands upon his majestys sacred ears and according to their dexterity and agility commonly rise to the posts of first ministers his wives too are admitted to try their skill and she among them who holds him by the ear is teckoned to have the surest and most lasting hold his present imperial majestys ears as i am informed are by no means of a delicate texture and consequently not quick of sensation so that it has proved extremely difficult to nick the tone of them the lightest and finest hands have urterly failed and many have miscarried who from either fear or respect did not treat the royal ears so roughly as was necessary he began his reign under the hands of a bungling operator who for his clumsiness he soon dismiffed he was afterward attempted by a more skilful tickler but he sometimes failed too and not being able to hit the humor of his majestys ears his own have often suffered for it  in this public distress and while majesty labored under the privation of auricular joys the empress who by long acquaintance and frequent little trials judged pretty well of the texture of the royal ear resolved to undertake it and succeeded perfectly by means of a much stronger friction than others durst either attempt or could imagine would please  in the mean time the skilful mandarine far from being discouraged by the ill success he had sometimes met with in his attempts upon the emperors ears resolved to make himself amends upon his imperial consorts he tried and he prevailed he tickled her majestys ear with such perfection that as the emperor would trust his ear to none but the empress she would trust here is to none but this lightfingered mandarine who by these means attained to unbounded and uncontrouled power and governed ear by ear  but as all the mandarines have their earticklers too with the same degree of influence over them and as this mandarine was particularly remarkable for his extreme sensibility in those parts it is hard to say from what original titillation the imperial power now flows  the conclusion of the gentlemans story was attended with the usual interjections of wonder and surprise from the company some called it strange some odd and some very comical and those who thought it the most improbable i found by their questions were the most desirous to believe it i observed too that while the story lasted they were most of them trying the experiment upon their own ears but without any visible effect that i could perceive  soon afterward the company broke up and i went home where i could not help reflecting with some degree of wonder on the wonder of the rest because i could see nothing extraordinary in the power which the ear exercised in china when i considered the extensive influence of that important organ in europe here as in china it is the source of both pleasure and power the manner of applying it is only different here the titillation is vocal there it is manual but the effects are the same and by the bye european ears are not always unacquainted neither with manual applications  to make out the analogy i hinted at between the chinese and ourselves in this particular i will offer to my readers some instances of the sensibility and prevalency of the ears of great britain  the british ears seem to be as greedy and sensible of titillation as the chinese can possibly be nor is the profession of an eartickler here any ways inferior or less lucrative there are three sorts the private tickler the public tickler and the selftickler  flatrery is of of all methods the surest to produce that vibration of the air which affects the auditory nerves with the most exquisite titillation and according to the thinner or thicker texture of those organs the flattery must be more or less strong this is the immediate province of the private tickler and his great skill consists in tuning his flattery to the ear of his patient it were endless to give instances of the influence and advantages of those artists who excel in this way  the business of a public tickler is to modulate his voice dispose his matter and enforce his arguments in such a manner as to excite a pleasing sensation in the ears of a number or assembly of people this is the most difficult branch of the profession and that in which the fewest excel but to the few who do it is the most lucrative and the most considerable the bar has at present few proficients of this sort the pulpit none the ladder alone seems not to decline  the selftickler is as unhappy as contemptible for having none of the talents necessary for tickling of others and consequently not worth being tickled by others neither he is reduced to tickle himself his own ears alone receive any titillation from his own efforts i know an eminent performer of this kind who by being nearly related to a skilful public tickler would fain set up for the business himself but has met with such repeated discouragements that he is reduced to the mortifying resource of selftitillation in which he commit the most horrid excesses  besides the proofs abovementioned of the influence of the ear in this country many of our most common phrases and expressions  from whence the genius of a people may always be collected  demonstrate that the ear is reckoned the principal and most predominant part of our whole mechanism to have the ear of ones prince is understood by every body to mean the having a good share of his authority if not the whole which plainly hints how that influence is acquired  to have the ear of the first minister is the next if not an equal advantage i am therefore not surprised that so considerable a possession should be so frequently attempted and so eagerly solicited as we may always observe it is but i must caution the person who would make his fortune in this way to confine his attempt strictly to the ear in the singular number a design upon the ears in the plural of a first minister being for the most part rather difficult and dangerous however just  to give ear to a person implies giving credit being convinced and being guided by that person and all this by the success of his endeavors upon that prevailing organ  to lend an ear is something less but still intimates a willingness and tendency in the lender to be prevailed upon by a little more tickling of that part thus the lending of an ear is a sure presage of success to a skilful tickler for example a person who lends an ear to a minister seldom fails of putting them both in his power soon afterward and when a fine woman lends an ear to a lover she shows a disposition at least to farther and future titillation  to be deaf and stop ones ears are common and known expressions to signify a total refusal and rejection of a person or proposition in which case i have often observed the manual application to succeed by a strong vellication or vigorous percussion of the outward membranes of the ear  there cannot be a stronger instance of the great value that has always been set upon these parts than the constant manner of expressing the utmost and most ardent desire people can have for any thing by saying they would give their ears for it a price so great that it is seldom either paid or required witness the numbers of people actually wearing their ears still who in justice have long since forfeited them  over head and ears would be a manifest pleonasmus the head being higher than the ears were not the ears reckoned so much more valuable than all the rest of the head as to make it a true climax  it were unnecessary to mention as farther proofs of the importance and dignity of those organs that pulling boxing or cutting off the ears are the highest insults that choleric men of honor can either give or receive which shows that the ear is the seat of honor as well as of pleasure  the anatomists have discovered that there is an intimate correspondence between the palm of the hand and the ear and that a previous application to the hand communicates itself instantly by the force and velocity of attraction to the ear and agreeably prepares that part to receive and admit of titillation i must say too that i have known this practiced with success upon very considerable persons of both sexes  having thus demonstrated by many instances that the ear is the most material part in the whole mechanism of our structure and that it is both the seat and source of honor power pleasure and pain i cannot conclude without an earnest exhortation to all my countryfolks of whatsoever rank or sex to take the utmost care of their ears guard your ears o ye princes for your power is lodged in your ears  guard your ears ye nobles for your honor lies in your ears  guard your ears ye fair if you would guard your virtue  and guard your ears all my fellow subjects if you would guard your liberties and properties  the nine lives of a cat by bonnel thronton esquire he has as many lives as a cat said a gentleman the other day in company speaking of his friend who had run through a perpetual course of riot and debauchery and had just recovered from a violent fever occasioned by his intemperance the thought struck me that too many indeed seem to be as regardless of their present existence as if they imagined they could die more than once i pursued my thought still farther and concluded that the greatest part of mankind were they even possessed of as many lives we will say as a cat would be indifferent to them all at least they would wantonly throw away the eight however careful and studious some of them might be to preserve the last  suppose a man then to have as many lives as a cat let us see what glorious use he would make of this extraordinary privilege must it not be a great incitement to him to hazard them repeatedly upon honorable and virtuous occasions i grant it and it must likewise be granted to me that they would equally be lavished away upon trivial dishonorable and wicked occasions  alexander had he had nine times nine lives to lose would have risqued every jot of them to conquer as many worlds let me ask whether the king of prussia or the marquis of granby would not as cheerfully run the same hazard but would  and  o that englishmen could not fill the blanks up have done the same perhaps they might have ventured some portion of their precious lives perhaps they might have poured out some part of the vapid mixture drop by drop still careful of the last dregs they perhaps like the miser who plays for gain might have been tempted to stake a little of their fortune but could never have been prevailed on like the bold and generous gamester to throw for the whole they in fine would scarcely have set to borrow an expression of shakespeare even one of their nine lives on the hazard of the die  on the other side let us take a view of these brethren of the blade to whom the one life which is sparingly bestowed on us mortals seems scarce worth the having i suppose it to appear so to them from their readiness to resign it themselves or to take it away from others upon any occasion or if you will in the hibernian phrase upon no occasion at all one instance shall serve for all suppose there are eighteen lives between us i tread upon your toe satisfaction is demanded and is honorably given by your firing at my brains which are missed we have lives enough to spare and you have a nose lest for me to pull i handle it in consequence i fire at your brains and cannot hit them what then is to be done why nothing is to be done only you are to kick me that is all i turn about draw my sword and like men of honor we must each of us lose one of our nine lives before we part friends i am indeed sensible that the punctilios of nice honor would induce the professors of it to ask this genmanlike question before the engagement  pray sir how many lives have you to lose and there is no doubt upon a disparity that the seconds would take care that the principals should be so far upon an equality that the longesttobeliver should be first put to death as often as was necessary till the combatants were in that respect at par  it must undoubtedly be allowed me where the antagonists are equal or made equal by the foregoing method that one or other of the parties would nine times kill or nine times be killed provided he has reason to cry out with othello  though all his hairs were lives my great revenge has stomach for them all   the bravery of a man fighting a duel with himself without second or antagonist vulgarly called selfmurder is frequently manifested even in our present state of existence where we have but one life to lose it must therefore be granted on the supposition of our lives being multiplied to nine that suicide would become a general fashion among us though in eight instances out of nine it would betray a meanness of spirit we should never be induced to believe a man was tired of himself in real earnest though he had got rid of himself ever so often except he fairly sent himself out of the world for the ninth and last time  let us suppose for instance that a man of quality has ad a run of illluck at the hazardtable to be sure he would shoot himself through the head directly upon his reviving he tries his fortune a second time and is reduced to the necessity of running himself through the heart after his recovery he is obliged repeatedly to make use of the same or other methods that the losses of his lives may be even with the losses of his estate would not this unhasty behavior show a love for his precious lives since he would not put an end to all nine of them directly one after another  to prove such behavior to be quite mean and vulgar let us farther suppose that a cobbler jerks his awl up between the third and fourth rib  i kill my heroes with the same precision as is used by homer  a barber takes a clean stroke just under the chin a tailor makes his quietus with a bare bodkin i shall have my shoes heelpieced my beard shaved and my doublet mended notwithstanding the allusion is too obvious about the end and the last but i hope to be indulged on this subject in considering my tailor not without propriety as only the ninth part of a man  many many instances might be thought of to evince that a man endowed with the lives of a cat would get quit of the encumbrance of supernumerary ones as fast as possible take a lover for example without a metaphor he would be so much enamoured as literally to die many times for the same or some other mistress we will suppose what is mere supposition a constant enamorato  upon the least flight or indifference such as a frown or a box on the ear my swain hurries away to rosamonds pond after drowning he rises up tolerably cooled on another occasion he surveys the trees in the dark walk at vauxhall picks out a stout branch and with the leisure of your true lovers melancholy unties his garters at the last he tucks himself up and dangles till a happy pair comes in his way and he is cut down the lady after all this proof of his affection is still stony hearted he dies and dies on for her and having put himself out of eight of his existences can he be blamed if he reserves the precious one still remaining for a beauty or a fortune or a woman of quality  or his maid  suppose again for there can be no end of suchlike suppositions that i am an author my works indeed i flatter myself will live after me but though i had all the lives of a cat through each of them i might lead the life of a dog my garret we will say has inspired me to soar so high as to attempt a sublime ode or epick poem i am let down by it is want of sale the beam across my chamber is very inviting and at least the bedcords are remaining i am afterward lowered to humble prose my publisher will not afford me smallbeer and i choose to have my fill of water by a plunge into the river thames after sinking and soaring for eight times alternately i at last sit down contented in a gaol to supply copy scrap by scrap as the printers little imp calls for it since as the proverb has it he must needs go whom the devil drives  i shall say very little of the bold methods which bucks and bloods would take delight in to shorten their lives were they ever so many for these are obvious and continually practiced even in the present narrow space of their existence how often would a choice spirit for example be literally dead drunk would he scruple to lay his lives down one after the other under the table as long as he could be certain he should rise up and stand upon his legs again the debauchee of every character would doubtless be as hasty to get rid of his load of lives as he is at present neglectful in preserving his single one  upon this principle of each individual enjoying a multiplicity of lives let us farther consider how a nation or society or community of them might exist it may i know be urged that fielding himself and all the sitting aldermen put together would not be sufficient to support the police a man you will say would risque being hanged eight different times for eight different capital offenses resolving to be very honest afterward for the remainder of his lives granted but in such a case it is most probable that the wisdom of the legislature would direct that a convict should be sentenced to be hanged like a cat till he were dead dead dead dead dead dead dead dead dead  i went to bed after having written thus far reflecting that no man should be entitled to a second existence  i mean in our mortal state  without having made a proper use of the first this reflection was so strongly impressed upon my mind that it was able to employ the succeeding morning in setting down the particulars of a dream occasioned by it  i imagined that every one was indulged with a privilege after death of having his existence renewed but with this restriction that he could prove that he had not forfeited his former life by not setting a proper value on it i accordingly conceived myself in a sort of court of claims where a number of us were brought by death in order to be examined about our pretensions to be revivified the sight of the crowd struck me with horror some appeared to be covered with blains and blotches some quite emaciated and some with bloated carcases one bore the marks of a tight knot under the left ear another had his scull shattered to pieces and another had a great gash in his side miltons description of a lazarhouse falls far short of what i then thought i saw  truth and justice were the examinants and the candidates for a new life underwent a strict scrutiny the first that i observed was called before them stepped up with a bold air and claimed a new existence on account of his having died for his country the plea was not approved of for a common soldier who had fallen in the same battle deposed that he himself shot him in an engagement where the enemy was inferior at the instant that this commander had ordered a retreat the soldier was directly reinstated into life  a jolly personage was next examined and he pretended that he was accidentally choked by a turtlefin though the newspapers had falsely attributed his death to an apoplectick sit it being proved upon him that he had dined the day before and eat heartily upon turbot and venison and that he had drank plentifully of old hock and claret the court ecreed that he died of a surfeit and refused to indulge him in any more good living  a mere skeleton crawled up next and declared that he only wished to be made alive again for the service of the fair sex from his examination it was manifest that he had spent his life in and about covent garden he was adjudged upon his own plea unfit to exist again  the next was an old decrepid figure seemingly worn down with age and cares his uit for the renewal of his life was in compassion to him rejected because it plainly appeared that he had already dragged out a most miserable one and had actually died of want in the midst of abundance his son put in a petition for his reexistence at the very same time setting forth that he was reduced by the mean spirit of his father to die an untimely death at tyburn the compassion of the court in not suffering him to live again was also extended to the young gentleman on account of his tender years there being little doubt but that he would come to the same untimely end let his lives be renewed ever so often  a blunt young fellow not less than six feet high next insisted upon being restored to life another of the same make and for the same reason insisted upon the like they had each of them in the honorable way put each other to death it was determined upon hearing both parties separately that neither of them should run the risque of being put to death again as neither of them would allow that the other deserved to live  a horrid spectacle next presented itself he most earnestly requested to enjoy again that being which he confessed he had rashly and desperately got rid of his request was not granted because it was certain that the same would be repeated upon the slightest occasion  i observed in imagination even some ladies of quality who wished to have their beauty renewed together with their lives most of them had died at public places where they went for the recovery of their health  my dream was put an end to all of a sudden by being myself summoned up to give a reason why i should be glad to exist again i pleaded guilty and awaked upon sentence being pronounced that i should starve again as an author  a modern justice of peace drawn from the life pray send me the ax re latin to augustus peace my motto is a true and genuine specimen of the profound learning of a modern justice and to whom shakspeares shallow was not fit to hold a candle it was an order from one of that learned body to his bookseller to send him the acts relating to a justice of peace and does sufficiently display his capacity of judging of the laws and deciding the differences and disputes among his majestys good subjects and there can be i think no doubt but as soon as he got the ax he hewed the laws with wonderful skill and ability how many such worshipful magistrates there are in the kingdom i cannot pretend to say but whoever will look back for thirty years past will confess that there has within that time been a very extraordinary alteration in the general justiceship of this kingdom  gentlemen of honor and fortune in their several counties used to be appointed and thought it no disgrace to act as justices but since faction has shed it is baneful influence and every thing has been carried by the current of corruption since partyzeal and a ready subserviency to ministerial measures have been thought the most necessary qualifications for a magistrate and since a lower set of people as being properest for such sinister purposes have been advanced to the seat of justice gentlemen of honor and fortune have in general not caring for such work or such company declined acting and it is very remarkable that as within that period the general administration of justice throughout the kingdom has sunk into the hands of a lower class of people so within that time also the power of a justice has rose and been proportionably increased  great power being on such principles and for such purposes thus lodged in little minds is it to be wondered at if many of them should turn justice into a trade or if some of them should be so illiterate as not to be able to read what a droll scene it must be and what a fund of mirth it must afford to see his worship augustus peace sitting in the chair of magistracy and hear him learnedly discussing the laws and deciding justice while i was considering what a comical farce it would make and was musing on the drollery of the scene i insensibly fell asleep when mimick fancy ever busy pursued the subject and presented to me the following sarce  methought i saw his worship augustus peace sitting in an elbowchair at the head of a long table with a book pen ink and paper thereon and a group of people men and women attending at the lower end thereof when his worship bade a boy step to the stable and tell john scrub to come immediately john with his short cropped hair and dirty frock presently came in took his seat by his worship and laid hold of the pen and ink then mr augustus with great solemnity said  master constable what defense has been committed what crime has been disturbed and how has his majestys peace been broke and vindicated  constable an please your honors worship here is one mary blabtruth has lost a smock and says that dorothy lightfinger has stolen it an so an please you i have brought them both before your worship   mr augustus a smock stolen why that is downright forjury by law bring the complainant dorothy lightfinger before me   constable this is the woman an please your worship   mr augustus hussy how came you to have the sire of god before your eyes and steal the womans smock you are an equitous baggage and will be hanged   dorothy lightfinger an please your worship i did not steal her smock   mr augustus why how now here is the woman confesses she did not steal the smock where is the defendant mary blabtruth   constable here she is an please your worship   mr augustus how came you to discharge dorothy lightfinger with stealing your smock for she denies her innocence of it   mary blabtruth an please your worship my smock was hanging on a gooseberrybush in the garden and i saw dorothy lightfinger take it off with my own eyes   dorothy lightfinger an please your worship there is no belief in what she says for    mr augustus peace woman peace i forbid you to hold your tongue   mary blabtruth indeed an please your worship what i say is true i looked through the kitchenwindow and saw her take it for i was at that very time frying bacon for my husbands dinner   mr augustus frying bacon woman was you frying bacon   mary blabtruth yes an please your worship and some cabbage for my husbands dinner he desired me   mr augustus where is this womans husband   thomas blabtruth here an please your worship   mr augustus did you desire your wife to fry bacon for your dinner   thomas blabtruth yes an please your worship with some cabbage   mr augustus here is a plot found out here is a miscovery why frying bacon is a high misdammer by law and you shall both go to the girlhouse and be hanged  master constable take them into cursetoday  and do you john scrub make out their mittamouse for they shall go to goal this instance   constable what would your worship please to have done with dorothy lightfinger   mr augustus o charge her and let her go about her baseness  methought john made out the mittimus and the constable carried off the baconfriers and the rest of the company were sent away and while i was wondering what his worship could mean by committing the man and his wife for frying bacon the scene changed and a court of judicature with all it is formalities presented itself the judge was sitting on the bench and a numerous body of black gowns and others attending and mr augustus peace came into court and seated himself not far from his lordship when the trial of thomas and mary blabtruth for frying bacon was called for frying bacon quoth the judge what is the meaning of this i never heard that frying bacon was a crime or against law before who committed these persons   mr augustus i committed them my lord it is against law and a high misdammer   judge pray mr justice show me that law for i never heard of such a one in all my life   mr augustus here is the book my lord and here is the place giving the book to his lordship  the judge having cast his eye upon the page burst out into a loud laugh and with much ado for laughing acquainted the court that the law which mr augustus had taken to be against frying bacon was that against firing a beacon which put the whole court into such a loud ha ha as awaked me   curious investigation of the right to eat founded on paines rights of man by sir brook boothby bart whether from timidity or prudence the author of rights of man has not carried his principles to their fair extent he has left untouched a thousand rights necessarily flowing from the imprescriptible and unalienable equality of man in society the right to eat for example is at least as natural and imprescriptible as the right to legislate it is somewhat more necessary and of as ancient and divine original and when dressed out in a philosophical uniform makes in my opinion just as good a figure man is an organized entity whose vitality consists in the action and reaction of solid and fluid parts according to the laws of animal motion which require to be frequently supplied and renewed by the adscitition of elements taken into the mouth masticated by the teeth ingurgitated by the gullet received into the stomach and there by trituration fermentation and the rest of the chemicomechanical process of digestion prepared and assimilated for the purpose of continuing animality and without which by the natural and imprescriptible laws of animation life must cease the right therefore to eat is one of those natural rights which appertain to man in right of his existance one of those which he must retain in society because the power to execute it is as perfect in the individual as the right itself it is also as ancient and of as divine original as that greatest of all truths the unity or equality of man and certainly as advantageous to cultivate  and god said behold i have given you every herb bearing seed which is upon the face of all the earth and every tree on the which there is the fruit of a tree yielding seed to you it shall be for meat   here we are got at the origin of man and the origin of his rights how the world has been governed from that day to this is no concern of ours every civil right grows out of a natural right and cannot invade those natural rights in which the power to execute is as perfect as the right itself hence it follows that the man who appropriates to himself a greater quantity of the food given by god equally to all than is necessary for his own consumption acts in defiance of the natural imprescriptible equal rights of man and that he who goes into the kitchen or larder of this invader of his natural rights and seizes upon what he wants acts in strict conformity to those rights which society cannot invade and as to the laws against theft or burglary they are not only in contradiction with the unalienable equal rights of man but were made by men who having ceased to be have no longer any authority in directing how the government of the world shall be organized or administered it is the living and not the dead that are to be accomodated the rights of the living cannot be willed away by the manuscript authority of the dead  the sailors retort or every man in his element on a trial at the admiralty sessions the counsel for

and taken in a nightcellar with his accomplice the scene of the present print is laid in a most infamous nightcellar then well known by the name of bloodbowl house near hanging sword alley fleet street  while the idle apprentice and his old oneeyed accomplice are dividing their booty a murdered man is let down through a trap door into a concealed cavity under the floor he may probably be considered as having been killed in the affray which is still continuing in the background and affords a masterly exhibition of vulgar miscreants making a dreadful appeal rather to utensils than to

cord hanging over his head the characteristick attitude of the grenadier in the corner the pistols the cards one of which appears to have been torn by an enraged gamester all assist very forcibly to

house of ill fame in wapping where he laid all night and had his whole property taken from him in the morning he vowed revenge against the first he should meet with possessed of cash and accordingly overtaking a gentleman in stepney fields to whom he related his mishap he insisted on having his loss made good the gentleman for some time expostulated with him on the atrocity of such behavior but to no purpose the tar was resolute and the gentleman dreading worse consequences delivered his purse but soon after had the sailor taken up examined and committed to newgate from whence jack sent a shipmate with the following strange epistle to the king   king charles one of thy subjects the other night robbed me of forty pounds for which i robbed another of the same sum who has inhumanly sent me to newgate and swears i shall be hanged therefore for thy own sake save my life or by g  d thou will lose one of the best seamen in thy navy thine  jack skiffton   his majesty on the receipt of the letter immediately wrote as follows   jack skiffton for this time i will save thee from the gallows but if hereafter thou art guilty of the like by g  d ill have thee hanged though the best seaman in my navy thine  charles rex   epistle from common honesty to common sense loving kinsman the severe treatment i have constantly met with and the universal scorn and contempt so manifestly shown me by all ranks and degrees of men have so sensibly affected my constitution that i once thought of nothing less than making a total exit from this ungrateful world but the kind reception which you  who are well known to be a collateral branch of our family  have lately met with has somewhat raised my drooping spirits and encouraged me to show my head once more though i am so worn to a skeleton that the few of my friends and acquaintance who are yet living i believe will hardly know me again  when i speak of my own sufferings you may perhaps be moved with some compassion as you reflect on the difficulties you have met with and the severities you have undergone though no way comparable to what has become almost habitual to me  you have indeed for some years been under a sort of proscription from courts and ministerial employments but at the same time you have enjoyed a comfortable retreat with the few patriots who have renounced all preferments to adhere to you and have not forsaken your cause in the worst of times while i have not been only rendered incapable of public trust but such has been the malice of my enemies that i am even denied the happiness of private society like a criminal branded with infamy it is become scandalous according to the present mode to be seen in my company or to entertain the least correspondence with me though god knows i have always led a blameless inoffensive life and am so universally hated and despised only because i cannot help people to support the reigning luxury and extravagance and grow rich all on a sudden without either merit or laudable endeavors  you know the misfortunes which besel our family at a certain time and the deplorable condition i was left in without any countenance or support at an age when it could hardly be expected i should shift for myself however i thought it necessary to endeavor getting into some business for my immediate subsistence and applied myself to a very eminent tradesman in the city requesting to be taken into his service but to my great grief this first attempt proved unsuccessful he told me i could not be of any use to him in the retail way that there was no instance of such a one as myself ever being behind a counter and in short that he would not advise me to think of being any way concerned in trade for that i should not find any dealer fond of employing me especially as i was a foreigner and not free of the city however in compassion to my wants the tradesman had goodnature enough to give me a letter of recommendation to a noted attorney of his acquaintance who as he assured me very much wanted my assistance and must therefore be glad to entertain me on honorable terms  this seeming friendship gave me some hopes and i immediately went with my credentials as directed being determined to apply myself wholly to that learned profession i was soon introduced but to my inexpressible concern met with a cold reception he sat lolling in a great elbowchair and answered me with a yawning  what is your name sir  common honesty sir i replied com  mon hon  esty cries he yawning again i have read the letter you brought but am sure common sense never fent you hither i cannot by any means receive you into my house you can be of no manner of use to me in my branch of business all the imaginary services you may do will never bear the expense of your maintenance for i cannot employ you in one cause in twenty if i should i might be in danger of losing many clients who would naturally suspect your betraying their secrets and if they were once to know i have any dealings with you it would blast my character besides adds he young man were i minded to bear with all these inconveniences at the request of my friend who recommended you to me you would never find the practice of the law turn to any account for yourself you are so odious among those of our profession that it is a great question with me whether you would ever be admitted as an attorney but if you should how will you live who the devil do you think will employ you most people will be afraid of trusting their business in your hands therefore i would advise you to turn your thoughts to some other profession and if you can do nothing better get yourself ordained you surely cannot be obnoxious to the clergy they will at least give you such outward countenance that you will never want a reasonable support and maintenance  finding this solid reasoning would bear no contradiction and being thoroughly convinced i had mistaken myself greatly in this second attempt i maturely considered the wholesome advice given me and began to form some method of putting it in execution and in effect soon thought of a person i imagined very proper for my purpose and who should this be but a certain right reverend who when young had great obligations to our family in recommending him to his first preferment in the church the remembrance of which i hoped would establish me in his favor  i attended him one morning early and waited an hour before i could beadmitted to an audience when my patience being almost worn out on a sudden the word was given for the stranger to come in to my lord i immediately entered and paid my respects to his lordship in a most submissive manner how do you do young man says the prelate i have not seen you a great while i thought you was dend or gone abroad and pray what has brought you hither now i gave him the best account i could of my past misfortunes and present unhappy case and while i was employing all my rhetoric to move his pity and compassion his lordship was reading which inattention to my request gave me little hopes of success at last he suddenly laid down his book and turned up his head toward the cieling  for i remarked he could not look me in the face and therefore i inferred he was ashamed to see me  and then spoke thus   you talk of the obligations i have had to your family i know of none some little civilities indeed passed between me and them at college when your father officiously thrust himself upon me as a tutor and to direct me in my first setting out in the world but if i had trusted to his judgment understanding or credit i might have remained at college still and then he declared he knew of no obligations he had to any one belonging to me so that he could not in any sort intermeddle in my affairs which he thought very incompatible with his station and might be a hindrance to his farther advancement and wished me to provide for myself in the best manner i could for added he you may rest assured you will have no assistance from me  from the example of this right reverend and the discourse i had with others of what passed at this interview i was perfectly satisfied that for the want of interest at court which i knew myself to be wholly unprovided of there were little hopes of preferment in this road even if i should get ordained the utmost to be expected was some poor welsh living or a starving curacy in town these relections and the experience i had soon weaned me of all thoughts of dedicating myself to the service of the church  having now tried three different methods for my advancement which i found impracticable i knew not well what project next to fall on in this state of uncertainty my wants daily increased which brought me almost to despair however i walked out one morning and by accident met with a recruitingserjeant i bethought myself the army refused nothing and therefore since i could do no better was determined to list for a soldier i called the sergeant aside and offered myself to his disposal telling him at the same time as is usual in like cases my name and place of birth the sergeant instead of greedily embracing the offer stood some time in suspense scratching his forehead and at last said   i am afraid my lad you will never learn the military dicipline or make any figure in the field and should you list in our regiment you will be very troublesome both on march and in quarters for no comrade will care to mess with you however as our captain is in great want of men i will venture to introduce you  we went away directly to the captains quarters where the sergeant having told our business and i having answered the same questions as before our noble captain shook his head and said i might perhaps be fit for seaservice but that i was not of a proper size for his company and then demanded of the sergeant where he picked me up and how he came acquainted with me the sergeant replied with great truth that he never saw or heard of me before in his life and accidentally met me a little while ago send him packing then cries the captain this fellow would make a mutiny in the regiment besides i know all his family are disaffected to the present establishment in church and state and therefore i would not take him on any consideration  my evil genius still pursuing me i had recourse to another expedient i remembered my father in his lifetime had a place in the treasury which he enjoyed till the death of his patron a great man who presided at that board by which means i had some little insight into the business of that office and therefore i had no more wit than to fancy i might be useful to his successor i made indeed but a plain appearance as to dress however i resolved to equip myself in the best manner i could attend next morning at his levee and try my fortune once more  on my arrival at his door whether i was despised for not being a beau or for not coming in a coach or whether i was taken for a scotch lord just come to town with my own wants and my ancestors merits i cannot say but to my great surprize abraham brass the porter told me his master was not at home this i knew to be false and therefore would have gone in notwithstanding but abraham shut the door in my face  i could not imagine the cause of this treatment being sure the fellow did not know me however having time to recollect myself a little till opportunity offered by opening the door for somebodys going out i accosted abraham very courteously  sir says i you have insulted me without any provocation i must desire to be admitted and told him my name and the business i had with his master who i knew often valued himself on his intimacy with my family but alas i only made bad worse he fell furiously upon me in the most opprobrious language imaginable called me all the rascals and scoundrels he could think on swore i should never enter the doors while he was porter and that i only came there with some wicked design on his person or to rob the house and that if i did not instantly depart and be gone he would charge a constable with me and swear the peace against me  on this outrage i thought it proper to retire some distance from the door where i took the opportunity as several welldressed gentlemen were going in to tell them my case with the abuse i met with from abraham begging of them to acquaint his honor with the behavior of his servant but not a single word could i get out of one of them some shook their heads and others started from me as if i had been infected at last a grave elderly gentleman with a bundle of papers in his hands going into the great mans stopped a little to hear my complaints and was so kind as to open his mouth i have says he sir some small knowledge of your family with whom i was acquainted before i came into a public employment but what business have you here complaining of abraham brasss behavior will be to no purpose he knows his masters mind to whom he ought to be civil and whom he may be rude to and depend upon it you are so universally hated by the whole family whose interest it is that you should never come within these doors that you are not safe in staying longer so near them lest a worse evil befall you nay i do not know if it were suspected i now speak to you in so friendly a manner but it might be as much as my place is worth therefore i advise you to make off as fast as possible  by this time kinsman you may suppose i was in a very melancholy condition when i happened to meet with a country gentleman who without any hesitation on the first representation of my circumstances took me into his service and entertained me at his countryseat with great kindness and humanity he entrusted me with the management of all his affairs and advised with me on the most important transactions of his life in this situation i looked back on the misery of my former condition with joy and satisfaction changed for the present and being arrived at the bounds of my ambition peace and content despised all worldly greatness with the spirit of a philosopher  but as nothing in this world is permanent the devil put it into my ladys head to live in town and that my master might not oppose her design from the expenses attending the removal she persuaded him to offer himself as a candidate for the late election in a neighboring borough from the success of which she imagined great preferments would be had for the whole family the scheme was resolved on and i was presently dispatched away to the place of election as one my master consided in to make timely interest he intending to follow me in a few days i set out on this errand with no very good will foreboding my own destruction in the event and when i came to my journeys end i met with as little success the electors one and all took a mortal antipathy to me at first sight and instead of securing their friendship i made every one of them my enemy and on my masters arrival they insisted i should be forthwith discharged or he must not expect one vote there my masters eagerness to succeed in this election tempted him to comply immediately i was dismissed with a private intimation that though i was useless in an election yet if i went to town and waited with patience i should be taken in again for the management of my masters private affairs i knew no remedy but submission i went off as privately as i could and soon after my masters arrival in town i waited on him in hopes of what i expected being performed but never was a man so changed as my master he told me to my great grief and surprise that he had no farther service for me of any kind being now engaged to take other measures than when he lived retired in the country that he was firmly resolved never again to be under the restraint of any other servant that his election cost him a deal of money for a double return and all would be lost if he did not play his cards well and being under a solemn engagement never to have any the least correspondence with me he concluded with forbidding me his house  having thus loving kinsman tried all reasonable methods of getting a livelihood and having at present no means of subsistence my application which is the last i shall make is to you and finding you have set up a new work my humble request is to be taken into your service  there has formerly been a strict union and friendship betwixt the two branches of our family common sense and common honesty though i own yours to be of superior rank and dignity having supplied the world with many kings and queens but though we have not arrived to that honor you have found us useful in our station and it can be proved by many instances in history that common sense never flourished or made any considerable figure without the assistance of common honesty  i know the difficulties of my own condition and how hard it is unsupported to make my way through the world but as we have so often contributed to your support and none of your ancestors ever met with any material check or misfortune while our branch of the family was countenanced by them therefore as we fell so i hope we shall rise together  i do not suspect you will ever write for the ministry in which case i know i shall be entirely useless to you the only favor i ask is some employment under you in the mean time which will be gratefully acknowledged by your affectionate kinsman  common honesty  the strange adventures of monsieur de jardin the count de montalto sent monsieur de jardin one of his gentlemen to naples with five hundred pistoles to buy horses and being arrived there as he was standing the next evening in the gate of the inn throwing his purse of gold from one hand to the other he was observed by a young courtezan who wanted neither wit nor beauty the next morning she sent one of her spies privately to enquire who the object of her attention was his business and what other circumstances related to him or could be of advantage to her design being informed of particulars whereon to found her plot she dispatched one of her emissaries a cunning gipsey to acquaint him that a lady of quality and a relation of his entreated the favor of a visit the crafty decoy hovered at a distance till de jardin came out who as was his custom standing at the gate alone she with a modesty as counterfeit as her innocence asked if monsieur de jardin was within yes my sweet girl says he i am the person   signior says she my lady commands me to let you know she has the honor to be related to you and if it is not too great a condescension she begs you would spare half an hour from your more important affairs and bestow it on her de jardin was not much surprised at so obliging an invitation for though he knew of none of his relations who either to boe the title of lady or even lived in naples yet presuming on the comeliness of his person and good mien he imagined it was some lady of quality who was enamoured of him and with this pretense courted an opportunity to discover her passion madam says he i could wish myself worthy of so great a blessing as i now receive and since a ready submission to your ladys commands is the best proof i can give of my zeal and affection to her service i will this very minute pay my respects to her de jardin without going into his lodging went directly along with his guide who led him through several cross streets and byeways till they came to the house which in the front appeared fair and reputable at the door a person attended who conducted de jardin into a room richly furnished both for pleasure and taste as soon as the lady was acquainted that monsieur de jardin was below she descended with a portly and majestic grace which lest it should strike too great an awe upon her kinsman she sweetened with an affectionate familiarity and respect the wily courtezan spread her net so well that his dull eye could not discover the least deceit she displayed his pedigree with so much artifice that his obscure family was now derived from one of the most noble houses of all italy of which she had the honor to be no inconsiderable branch all which his pride and folly easily credited variety of discourse with mutual congratulations for so happy an interview had now spent a good part of the evening when the lady was whispered in the ear that supper was ready she ordered it to be brought in and though it was splendid and elegant she courteously pretended to excuse it as not good enough for so worthy a guest supper being over de jardin recollecting it grew late and that he was a stranger to the streets was ready with a long harangue of thanks to take leave of so honorable a kinswoman a profusion of compliments were mutually exchanged when taking him by the hand nay cousin says she though i am sensible your reception has not been equal to your merit yet i flatter myself that my house can afford you better accommodations than your inn and if you rob me of your company tonight you have not that esteem for me i am so ambitious of de jardin whose better genius was absent accepted the invitation  it soon grew bedtime and de jardin was attended to his apartment by the lady and two of her servants who after a solemn good night withdrew as he was stepping into bed the wine he had drank began to rumble in his stomach for it had been physically prepared for that purpose he therefore asked one of the servants for a necessary convenience and was directed into a little room adjoining his business required haste boldly stepping in a board which lay purposely loose gave way and down he fell to the bottom of the privy as soon as he had recovered himself from the fright  for hurt he received none except from what was transacting above  he cried out for help but nobody answered though he heard his kinswomans voice very merry and loud they were too busy in ransacking his pockets where they found the prize they wanted with bulk unbroken in this distress he discovered a wall which communicated with the street this he endeavored to scale but with repeated slips mired himself over head and ears at last however he succeeded and found himself in the middle of the street by the light of the moon he guessed at the house and rung so loud a peal at the door that a grim fellow opened a window and asked what drunken knave gave that unmannerly alarm i am sir says he the ladys cousin  sirrah says he you are an impudent liar i know no such person be gone in time or you will too late repent this saucy affront the approach of the watch at this instant forced de jardin to break off the dialogue and secure himself as he was looking for a place of shelter he spied an open bulk where in the daytime a cobbler and an herbwoman kept their shop into which he crept as far as he could to conceal himself till the watch was gone by three fellows who that night designed to rob the tomb of a cardinal who had lately been buried in the great church having hid their tools in this bulk now came for them de jardin hearing men talk lay close but one of them groping for the implements and often complaining of a horrible smell at last catched de jardin by the leg the surprise was equal on both sides however the fellow had the courage to pull him out and examine what sort of a creature lay concealed there de jardins shirt was so offensive that they forced him to strip for considering he might be of use to them in their present design and had possibly overheard some of their discourse they compelled him to go along with them notwithstanding he was now as naked as he was born yet the filth was thick crusted upon his skin and the smell so noisome they could not endure it for this one of them thought of a proper remedy hard by there was a deep well with a long chain and a bucket at the end of it hither they brought de jardin put him into the bucket let him down into the well and told him that as soon as he had washed himself clean he must shake the chain and they would draw him up while they stayed for de jardin the watch came it being very hot to refresh themselves with water the only beverage that could be had at that hour his companions were now forced to run and hide and the watch laid down their cloaks and halberts and drew up the bucket de jardin with a sudden spring leaped ashore which struck such a panick upon them that they fled leaving the pillage of the field their cloaks and halberts to de jardin and his comrades having now joined company again they went directly to the cardinals tomb and raised up the heavy marble but a dispute arose who should go in de jardin would not no says one of them wont you but you shall what did we bring you here for else they soon forced de jardin to descend and he reached them out the mitre and crosier and pulled off the cardinals gold fringe gloves which were richly embroidered he had heard them mention a diamondring of great value and this he slipped off and put upon his own finger to secure something in case of the worst they still bade him look for the ring he told them he could find none and they must come in if they either suspected his honor or honesty and look for it themselves i am sure said one it was said he had a very rich ring feel upon the other hand as they were thus arguing the case they heard a sudden noise in the church which they suspected might be some of the officers this frightened them so that away they ran and let the stone fall down leaving poor de jardin entombed with the dead cardinal this was a misfortune a thousand times worse than any that had yet befallen him it was impossible for him to raise up the stone and if he made a noise to discover himself he would certainly be executed for sacrilege and robbing the dead and to lie there and starve or be poisoned with the stench of the corrupting body was still more dreadful it happened that the noise which frightened his companions proceeded from some persons then breaking into the church upon the same design when they came to the tomb they raised up the marble strongly underpropped it and began like the others to dispute who should descend what says one of them a bold fellow are you afraid the dead cardinal should bite you let me come  as he was letting himself down de jardin catched fast hold of his legs the fellow frightened out of his wits cried out help help the cardinal has catched me by the legs and struggling got out and followed his companions who every step they made expected the cardinal would seize them this gave de jardin an opportunity of escaping he immediately quitted the church by the some way he had entered it and clothed with one of the watchmens cloaks walked about till morning when it was light he enquired out his inn where he borrowed some clothes and gave a terrible detail of his misfortunes  but not a word of the ring that evening he left naples and set forward for france without purchasing a single horse and though he had lost his money and clothes he was in possession of a ring the value of which at least balanced the account  the archbishops luck an odd adventure an archbishop of canterbury making a tour into the country stopped at an inn for refreshment being at the window he observed at a distance in a solitary wood a welldressed man alone talking and acting a kind of part the prelates curiosity was excited to know what the stranger was about and accordingly he sent some of his servants to observe him and hear what he was rehearsing but they bringing him back an answer no way satisfactory his grace resolved to go himself he accordingly repaired to the wood ordering his attendants to remain at a distance he addressed the stranger very politely and was answered with the same civility a conversation having been once entered into though not without interruptions by an occasional soliloquy his grace asked what he was about i am at play he replied at play said the prelate and with whom you are all alone  i own said he sir you do not perceive my antagonist but i am playing with god  his lordship thinking the man out of his mind replied  this is a very extraordinary party and pray at what game sir are you playing  at chess sir the archbishop smiled but the man seeming peaceable he was willing to amuse himself with a few more questions and do you play for any thing sir  certainly  you cannot have any great chance as your adversary must be so superior to you  he does not take any advantage but plays merely like a man  pray sir when you win or lose how do you settle your accounts  very exactly and punctually i promise you  indeed pray how stands your game the stranger after muttering something to himself said  i have just lost it  and how much have you lost  fifty guineas  that is a great sum how do you intend paying it does god take your money  no the poor are his treasurers he always sends some worthy person to receive the debt and you are at present the pursebearer saying this he pulled out his purse and reckoning fifty guineas put them into his graces hand and retired saying he should play no more that day  the prelate was quite fascinated he did not know what to make of this extraordinary adventure he viewed the money found all the guineas good recalled what had passed and began to think there must be something more in this man than he had discovered however he continued his jurney and applied the money to the use of the poor as had been directed  on his return he stopped at the some inn and perceiving the same person again in the wood in his former situation he resolved to have a little farther conversation with him and went alone to the spot where he was the stranger was a comely man and the prelate could not help viewing him with a kind of religious veneration thinking by this time that he was inspired to do good in this uncommon manner the prelate accosted him as an old acquaintance and familiarly asked him how the chance had stood since they had first met sometimes for me and sometimes against me i have both lost and won  and are you at play now  yes sir we have played several games today  and who wins  why sir at present the advantage is on my side the game is just over i have a sine stroke check mate there it is  and pray sir how much have you won  five hundred guineas  that is a handsome sum but how are you to be paid  i pay and receive in the like manner he always sends me some good rich man when i win and you my lord are the person god is remarkably punctual on these occasions  the archbishop had received a considerable sum that very day the stranger knew it and producing a pistol by way of receipt the prelate found himself under the necessity of giving up his cash and by this time discovered the divine inspired gamester to be nothing more or less than a thief his lordship had in the course of his journey related the first part of this adventure but the latter part he very prudently took great pains to conceal  a jackboot or modern essay on times persons and things a jackboot is a discourse which will suit any subject whatsoever as it is namesake will sit any leg it requires no title yet is capable of all you may preach it as a sermon declame it as an oration say it as a prayer or sing it as a song it will finally answer all intents and purposes though in itself it is to no intent or purpose such is the whimsical enigmatical nature of the jackboot  for these twenty years last past we have had little else published but jackboots one man prints a sermon which may as well be called a satire another comes out with a monody with three or four inter locutors in it our poetry is as prose and our prose is false english and shall not i club my jackboot among the rest yea verily i will  here therefore begins a jack boot upon times persons and things and first for the times i think we are all pretty

principality where the laburers in the spiritual vineyard are often obliged to siddle as well as to pray for the necessary support of themselves and families about half a century ago lived an honest and ingenious man of the sacred profession who having a great deal of duty to perform for which however he received a very inadequate recompense was often necessitated to cut as short as possible leaving his hearers to meditate on what he meant to advance in confirmation of his position one sunday in particular being engaged in the afternoon to play several airs on the welsh harp on which

who is no soldier  monsieur tonson a comic tale written by mr tailor there lived as fame reports in days of yore at least some fifty years ago or more a pleasant wight on town yclepd tom king a fellow that was clever at a joke expert in all the arts to teaze and smoke in short for strokes of humor quite the thing to many a jovial club this king was known with whom his active wit unrivaled shone  choice spirit grave free mason buck and blood would crowd his stories and bon mots to hear and none a disappointment ever could fear his humor flowed in such a copious flood to him a frolic was a high delight  a frolic he would hunt for day and night careless how prudence on the sport might frown if ever a pleasant mischief sprang to view at once over hedge and ditch away he flew nor left the game till he had run it down one night our hero rambling with a friend near famed st giless chanced his course to bend just by that spot the seven dials hight twas silence all around and clear the coast the watch as usual dozing on his post and scarce a lamp displayed a twinkling light around this place there lived the numerous clans of honest plodding foreign artizans known at that time by name of refugees  the rod of persecution from their home compelled the inoffensive race to roam and here they lighted like a swarm of bees well our two friends were saunting through the street in hopes some food for humor soon to meet when in a window near a light they view and though a dim and melancholy ray it seemed the prologue to some merry play so toward the gloomy dome our herodrew straight at the door he gave a thundering knock  the time we may suppose near two oclock i will ask says king if thomson lodges here thomson cries the other who the devils ne  i know not king replies but want to see what kind of animal will now appear after some time a little frenchman came  one hand displayed a rushlights trembling flame the other held the thing they call culotte an old stripped woollen nightcap graced his head a tattered waistcoat over one shoulder spread  scarce half awake he heaved a yawning note though thus untimely roused he courteous smiled and soon addressed our wag in accents mild bending his head politely to his knee  pray sare vat vant you dat you come so late i beg your pardon sare to make you vait pray tell me sare vat your commands vid me sir replied king i merely thought to know as by your house i chanced tonight to go  but really i disturbed your sleep i fear  i say i thought that you perhaps could tell among the folks who in this street may dwell if there is a mr thompson lodges here the shivering frenchman though not pleased to find the business of this unimportant kind too simple to suspect twas meant in jeer shuggd out a sigh that thus his rest should break then with unaltered courtesy he spoke  no sare no monsieur tonson loges here our wag begged pardon and toward home he sped while the poor frenchman crawled again to bed but king resolved not thus to drop the jest so the next night with more of whim than grace again he made a visit to the place to break once more the poor old frenchmans rest he knocked  but waited longer than before no footstep seemed approaching to the door our frenchman lay in such a sleep profound king with the knocker thundered then again firm on his post determined to remain and often indeed he made the door resound at last king hears him over the passage creep wondering what fiend again disturbed his sleep the wag salutes him with a civil leer thus drawling out to heighten the surprise while the poor frenchman rubbed his heavy eyes  is there  a mr thompson lodges here the frenchman faulterd with a kind of fright  vy sare i am sure i tell you sare last night and here he labored with a sigh sincere  no monsieur tonson in the varld i know no monsieur tonson here  i told you so indeed sare dear no monsieur tonson here some more excuses tendered off king goes and the old frenchman sought once more repose the rogue next night pursued his old career twas long indeed before the man came nigh and then he uttered in a piteous cry  sare pon my foul no monsieur tonson here our sportive wight his usual visit paid and the next night came forth a prattling maid whose tongue indeed than any jack went faster anxious she strove his errand to enquire he said twas vain her pretty tongue to tire he should not stir till he had seen her master the damsel then began in doleful state the frenchmans broken slumbers to relate and begged he would call at proper time of day king told her she must fetch her master down a chaise was ready  he was leaving town but first had much of deep concern to say thus urged she went the snoring man to call and long indeed was she obliged to bawl ere she could rouse the torpid lump of clay at last he wakes  he rises  and he swears but scarcely had he tottered down the stairs when king attacks him in the usual way the frenchman now perceived twas all in vain to this tormentor mildly to complain and straight in rage began his crest to rear  sare vat de devil make you treat me so sare i inform you sare tree nights ago got tam i swear no monsieur tonson here true as the night king went and heard a strife between the harrassd frenchman and his wife which should descend to chase the fiend away at length to join their forces they agree and straight impetuously they turn the key prepared with mutual fury for the fray our hero with the firmness of a rock collected to receive the mighty shock uttring the old enquiry calmly stood the name of thompson raised the storm so high he deemed it then the safest plan to fly with  well i will call when youre in gentler mood in short our hero with the same intent full many a night to plague the frenchman went so fond of mischief was the wicked wit they throw out water for the watch they call but king expecting still escapes from all monsieur at last was forced his house to quit it happened that our wag about this time on some fair prospect sought the eastern clime six lingering years were there his tedious lot at length content amid his ripening store he treads again on britains happy shore and his long absence is at once forgot to london with impatient hope he flies and the same night as former freaks arise he fain must stroll the wellknown haunt to trace ah here is the scene of frequent mirth he said my poor old frenchman i suppose is dead egad i will knock and see who holds his place with rapid strokes he makes the mansion roar and while he eager eyes the opening door lo who obeys the knockers rattling peal why even our frenchman strange to say he took his old abode that very day  capricious turn of sportive fortunes wheel without one thought of the relentless foe who fiendlike haunted him so long ago just in his former trim he now appears the waistcoat and the nightcap seemed the same with rushlight as before he creeping came and kings detested voice astonished hears as if some hideous spectre struck his sight his senses seemed bewildered with affright his face indeed bespoke a heart full sore then starting he exclaimed in rueful strain  begar here is

the comic magazine number x industry and idleness plate x the industrious prentice alderman of london the idle one brought before him and impeached by his accomplice hitherto since the first print we have not seen the two apprentices together their pursuits widely varied and they have been alternately presented with a most forcible contrast to each other the interest is wonderfully heightened on this melancholy interview the victim of vice originating in idleness a trembling culprit at the bar of justice while his fellowapprentice as the reward of industry and virtue having attained to the dignity of alderman of london is consequently a magistrate and has the severe but necessary duty to perform of committing for trial the companion of his early days who is impeached of robbery and murder by the profligate oneeyed associate with whom he commenced acquaintance by gambling on a tombstone during divine service this wretch who has turned evidence is swearing with the utmost audacity and unconcern to criminate his accomplice yet contrives at the same time to do what the vulgar denominate cheating the devil by taking the book with his left hand this imposition the priggish administerer of the oath with a pen stuck behind his ear is prevented from regarding by the application of a piece of money placed in the dexter palm which he holds slily behind for that purpose the jade who performs this piece of bribery has a good face and figure though she is supposed to cohabit with that horrid lump of vice and deformity to such shocking degradation is superior beauty generally reduced after the loss of innocence  the attitude of the worthy alderman while the mittimus is making out by his clerk which is to place his late fellowapprentice under the care of the keeper of newgate is a noble display of dignified suffering the concern too in the countenance of the afflicted mother who vainly seeks to soften the selfimportant constable is finely pourtrayed  on the whole this print is most exquisitely impressive and exhibits an interesting picture of human nature in which we behold guilt detected under all the agonizing horrors of remorse and virtue with a clear conscience feeling anguish but little inferior from the reflection of the ignominy which awaits the companion of his childhood  there are two excellent mottos for this print   ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment  leviticus xix    the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands  psalm ix    the art of kicking when i took on me the province of a public writer i was resolved to the best of my poor capacity to make my works entertaining as well as instructive to my readers in order to which i judged it would be absolutely necessary not to dwell too long on the subject man as well as woman delights in variety and the mind as well as the palate must have change of diet the quicquid agunt homines is indeed a large field for wit and satire to exercise themselves on but often of late when i had chosen my subject and sat down with a design of communicating my thoughts on it i found on recollection that i had been anticipated by some other authors who had lived before me  the spectator of moral and facetious memory reformed the periwigs the canes and the swordknots of the fops no he tripped up their red heels if i may be allowed that expression as to the fairsex he handled them from head to foot not a part about a fine lady was left untouched in a word whenever i take up the spectator i am ready every minute to break out into the same exclamation that a poet of gasoigny uttered on reading over a beautiful ode of horace  d  n these ancients says he they have stolen all my fine thoughts  writers of such universal talents may draw something that is useful and entertaining from the most barren subject in nature the spectator beforementioned has been very learned on dancing we have had writers of but a second or third class in fame who have had their excellence a baronet of north britain has published a large quarto on the art of fencing and a baronet of worcestershire has obliged the world with a treatise of immense erudition on the gymnastick science or the art of wrestling  but no people come up to the germans in their indefatigable industry for searching antiquity what immense volumes of ancient learning have they rescued from the cobwebs and oblivion how have they worked through the rust of time to make discoveries for the improvement of mankind and with what infinite labor have they collected the valuable fragments scattered in different authors on subjects of high importance to the learned world  i have myself seen a history written by one of the german literati entitled  de veterum lucernis et candelabris  of the lamps and candlesticks of the ancients it is certain we should be groping in the dark in search of many things belonging to antiquity had they not held lights to us another who was as bright a genius as the former was twenty years in compiling a treatise  de chirothecis et ocreis  on gloves and boots  i have been credibly informed by travelers that there is a large folio manuscript in the elector palatines library  de miseriis ambulantium  on the misery of walking on foot in which there is a physical dissertation on corns there are several volumes  de veterum cultellis et furcis  of the knives and forks of the ancients written by one vanderhackle enriched with cuts an art that has contributed very much to illustrate german wit what need i mention the great bamboozlebergius who has made a collection  de mendaciis antiquorum  of the lies of the ancients which work we hear is shortly to be printed in english for the improvement and edification of the youth of this kingdom a certain great man having taken upon him to patronize it so that i hope every person in employment will be obliged to subscribe under pain of being cashiered  i have likewise been informed that there has been for several years in the public library at ratisbon a most curious manuscript  de colophis et caleationibus veterum  of the kicks and cuffs of the ancients written by the learned vanhoofius and that a copy of this work was some years ago transmitted into england to be laid up in the royal library of st jamess that it was carefully revised and collated by the late learned doctor bentley who has amended an error in the title for he has proved that the substantive colophis must have been an interpolation of the transcriber and of consequence the true reading is  de calcationibus veterum which he translates thus  of the kicks on the arse of the ancients this shows how learning must have suffered through the ignorance of transcribers were it not for the accuracy of such judicious critics  to confess the plain truth i had a design of writing something on this subject myself and have already been at no small pains in looking over the cotton and bodleian libraries i do not know but it will be very well worth while to take a journey to rome on purpose to consult that of the vatican but i am a little too much confined at present i therefore beg the assistance of the learned of both our universities and i hope they will be so good as to communicate whatever discoveries they may have made on this subject in the course of their reading and as i should be glad to enrich this work with the choicest flowers of antiquity i intend to publish them here it is a subject if well handled that must give great satisfaction to the curious nay i could wish the world was but well informed of some late truths concerning kicking i fancy it would contribute toward curing the spleen of the whole nation  the stage is the representation of the world and certainly a man may know the humors and inclinations of the people by what is liked or disliked on the stage and i have often observed a kicking to be the most diverting scene in a modern comedy we have had several poets of our own nation who have succeeded very well this way there is a kicking betwixt sir harry wildair and alderman smuggler in the comedy called the trip to the jubilee which is allowed by the ablest critics to be a masterpiece of good writing there is also a kicking in the old old bachelor and another in the squire of alsatia which are excellently well penned  hitherto indeed these kickings have been only the support and ornament of the comic scene i wish with all my heart some poet of a sublime genius would venture to write a kicking in a tragedy i am well persuaded if an author were to introduce a king kicking the firstminister it would have a very good effect such an incident must certainly give great pleasure to the audience and contribute very much to the success of the play  but to come nearer to my present purpose i have taken no small pains in examining authors to find out when this custom of kicking first began in the world i am sorry that the writers of history have not been a little more particular in a matter of so great importance to mankind  some of the roman emperors  such as nero domitian and caligula  were given to kicking so indeed was our harry the eighth he made nothing of kicking the house of commons there is a box on the ear recorded of queen elizabeth it was a sudden sally of jealous love it was but a kind of aigre douceur and it does not appear that it was the fashion of her court the action of kicking might be thought a little too robust for the delicacy of her sex it might have exposed the royal legs et coetera to the sneers of the young fellows of the court therefore she modestly turned it into a box on the ear  as no man can account how fashions rise and fall who knows but the practice of kicking on every trifling occasion may become a fashion in this kingdom one of the greatest wits of our nation has placed the seat of honor in a certain part of the body that i do not well know how to describe it is the part which we must not name in wellbred company yet happy is the fair maid who shall rise with that part uppermost in a morning good luck shall attend her her lover shall be kind and all the wishes of that day shall be crowned with success but if i must describe it still plainer it is the part where schoolboys are punished for false concords and for playing truant if it should i say become a fashion you would see a fellow at court who had just received a most gracious kick on that part return as proud as a citizen from being knighted and why may not the honor of knighthood be conferred this way as well as by the sword and indeed why might not all titles be conferred this way  again if you should happen to see a crowd of slaves running to the levee of some court favorite in a morning and any body should ask how comes this man to be so courted or so followed the natural answer in this case would be  he has been lately kicked into preferment  it might be turned to excellent use toward carrying on the designs of ministers of state in case they should happen to be pursuing measures apparently destructive to the liberties of their country for in this case they must for their own safety be obliged to bribe the representatives of the people and as they would certainly bribe with the peoples money not with their own and as i should think it a very right thing to save the public money i should for that reason humbly propose that kicking might be introduced into public business instead of bribing i do not doubt that it might answer the same purposes for i am firmly of opinion that whoever will take a bribe will take a kicking  i believe some examples may be brought where it has been made use of with success men i say have been kicked as well as bribed into measures against their country and therefore it is not at all improbable but it may some time or other become a method of carrying on state affairs if we should live to see that day young princes instead of riding fencing and dancing would have proper masters provided to instruct them in kicking and as he that undertook to eat a sword began by eating a dagger so a young adept should begin by kicking his hat before he was put to kick a man  as to the young nobility and gentry instead of wasting their youth in studying to understand horace and virgil they might be instructed to take a kicking with a good grace by which means you would see a polite nobility a valiant gentry a most pious dignified clergy and a court that would be a constellation of the most illustrious personages of the kingdom  there is a court of honor in all the countries of europe in france the mareschals or generals preside in it in england the judge of the court of honor is hereditary in the family of the first duke of the kingdom i should think that the ceremonial of kicking a man into a title or a great employment might be settled by the judges of these courts of honor if i might be worthy of advising in matters of so high a nature i should think it would be too great a fatigue for the prince himself to kick the whole court especially in countries where the court is numerous i am therefore of opinion that nobody should have the honor of being kicked by the sovereign except the first minister the principal secretaries of state the president of his councils and some few others the great officers of the crown but these might kick those next in employment under them who might kick the next and so it might gradually descend till there should not be a man in any employment in the kingdom but what might be kicked  it is not yet indeed become a custom in any part of europe the more is the pity for i think it would be a truly royal exercise for a prince to divert himself with kicking two or three of his ministers every morning it would contribute to the preservation of his own health as well as to mending the manners of his court and i believe it would have become a fashion some where or other were it not that the young nobility of all nations travel to france and are apt to retain impressions of what they see there the barbarity of a french education will not suffer a gentleman to take a kick from any person be he ever so great without some terrible consequences but i hope that in this nation we may live to get the better of those prejudices which may have this good consequence it may introduce an elegance and politeness of manners not known in the world except among the ancient goths and modern hottentots  i may say without vanity that we are not such barbarians but there may be found among us some great men who can pocket up a kick or a cuff with as good an air as they could a bribe and as to those splendid agitations of choler which are apt to break out into rogue and rascal i am credibly informed some very stately persons are so used to them that they receive them with the same countenance as  sir i kiss your hands this shows we are well disposed for a reformation of manners yet i fear it will not grow into general imitation unless the court should set the example which i am afraid will not happen but if we should live to see that day the placemen must of course all fall into it and i think it would be pleasant enough when a great employment became vacant to see a parcel of impudent fellows in lace and embroidery pressing and elbowing to be kicked  if the common people who are not fond of new fashions at their first rise should discover any dislike of coming into it why might not a standing army be employed to kick the whole nation  advertisement from dorothy redfist or qualifications of a modern maidservant setting aside all household work which i do very well if i please i can tell lies of my master and mistruss and when i am sent of an arrand let it be for what it will in the grocery way allways go to the chandlersshop where the good old woman that keeps it commonly keeps a dram of that that is good and is as eager to know the secrets of the family as i am to tell them  secondly i can take a lump of freshbutter  if it is not quite so good for a sarvants stomach as it should be  and flounce it into the greasetubb  or the inside sat of a surloin of beef  with as much dexterity as any girl in the kingdom those an i say it where many other sarvants to their shame be it spoken would give it away to a dog or a poor parson which i think is no sign of their savingness because if they rightly consider the revenues of the greasetubb when properly managed would bring them three of four good gownds to their backs in a year  thirdly i am very quick of hearing when nobody calls and if any body does especially my master or mistrus i am so deaf i cannot hear them till they have almost tore their winpipes with calling this is a soverign vartue in a sarvant for when a master or mistrus thinks a sarvants deaf they are apt to talk about their secrets with less suspicion and sometimes they may call one another dog and bitch upon the presumption that the sarvant cannot hear them  fourthly when there is any reason to imagine my mistrus  going to have a new gownd i can tell her such a story that i ant in the least afeard of getting the old one for myself  fifthly if my master should come home late and in liquor i can help him up to bed and in case my mistrus is out of town supposing he should be incapable of undressing himself i can pull off his clothes and if required can go to bed to him as well as my mistrus  sixthly if my mistrus should be a breeding woman and apt to lyeinn during the time i can side with the nurse and make as much waste as herself play up old gooseberry with the pots and saucepans and nock the pewter and brasses about with as much consideration as if they cost nothing at all  seventhly during her lyinginn i can trump up a story about my masters going to lewd women this you know may have it is effect for if a mistrus takes on in such a situation and frets much about it who knows but she may die and then i stand a chance to marry my master  eighthly if there is a crust of bread harder than ordinary i always carry it to my masters table for masters and mistrusses may eat it because they know their sarvants will not  ninthly if there is any kind of greens for dinner  as there commonly is  i always take care to send the outside leaves to masters table and detach the best part in a cullender over some hot water till they have done for why should not sarvants know what is good as well as their masters and mistrusses  p s these and many other excellent vartues too tedious to mention i porsses and should take it very kind of you mr editor if you should hear of any body that wants such a sarvant indeed it is not any place i would go to for good places are very scarce and where there is one master or mistrus that knows the vartues of a true sarvant there are twenty that dont therefore i should be obliged to you if you publish the above catalog in your maghazeen  conjugal case of a country physician or cautions to old batchelors i am a physician and as my case is very extraordinary i mean to publish it for the benefit of the public when a man lives as i did unmarried till he is sixtyone he had better never marry at all there are more ways by which a woman may torment her husband besides being jealous of him to give you some idea of my situation take the general outlines of my history the earliest part of my life i spent at college in the study of physic and i dont know why acquired the character of an odd learned fellow when i arrived at the age of forty a vacancy happened in the neighborhood of my birth and i was invited by my uncle to take upon me the infirmities of all the folks within the circle of twenty miles before i set out i ordered the collegebarber to make me what the wags called a lion or a pompy literally nothing more than a good physical wig under the shadow of which by the assistance of a handsome cane properly applied to the immovable muscles of my face and a few very significant shrugs and solemn nods i soon acquired the reputation of an eminent physician fees came in apace so that in the course of twenty years i had saved up more money than i really knew what to do with whether it was my learning my person or my money i cannot say but a lady of the neighborhood took a vast liking to something belonging to me i was not so blind but i saw the conquest for she would often come and spend a week together with me in short i married her  i was past the years of discretion and so i married her o what a condescension a lady of her rank family and fashion in life as for age indeed she was but six years younger than myself and for fortune if she ever had any she had spent it and yet i was such a fool as to be convinced she was conferring the greatest obligation in the world upon me  no sooner did e take upon her the management of my family than adieu for ver to all order peace and comfort she began with discharging poor jonas because he made so queer a figure in a long qu and white stockings which she insisted upon his wearing though the poor follow could not but laugh at himself the same day with jonas my old wig was discarded it must be confessed it rather grew the worse for wear from long acquaintance it had contracted such a connection and familiarity that it no longer kept that real distance from each side of my face which had at first so much distinguisned it i had however still contiued it in servie purely from this reflection that the older it grew the loss occasion it had for combing a new wig has been immediately put on the shocks with a feathered top and forked tail since the arrival of which i am never suffered to stir out let the occasion be ever so pressing before it is combed and powdered our prig of a new footman is so long in twisting and turning and tickling it up that a score of patients have expired and the fees have been lost ere i was able to set out to relieve them  my snuffcoloured suit had been reinstated every other year from a pattern that was left in the hands of an honest tailor on the neighboring heath he poor fellow was likewise forbid the house because according to my directions he made my clothes easy a more fashionable operator was charged with preparing a new suit with gold buttonholes he made them to sit so exactly that i dare not bring my hands to meet before me for fear of laying open my spinal bone  my hat is not to be slapped any more even though the sun shine full in my face  i am no longer suffered to wash my face according to custom every morning at the pump in my backyard though nothing was more refreshing nor any thing more handy than the towel which revolved on a roller at the back of the kitchendoor  on my return home the other day from visiting a patient i found the maid had set my study to rights as she called it but the consusion which the regularity has occasioned is almost inconceivable my toepin my shoeinghorn and tobaccostopper are lost for ever my papers are disposed in such order that i know not where to recur to any thing i want  two pair of old manchester velvet breeches which i left on the back of a chair have disappeared and instead of the easy slippers which i had made out of an old pair of shoes by cutting the straps off i found a new pair of red leather adorned with white stitches round the edges and made so neat that i cannot bear to walk in them  my woollen nightcap is condemned in company with my brown hose to the vile purpose of rubbing the grates and senders and my wife insists that i wear one of linen flounced on all sides adorned with a black ribband which tying together the aperture within an inch and a half of the top carelessly slows down on the side i took such a violent cold the first night that it brought a defluxion of humors into my right eye which very nearly deprived me of sight  the staircase and floors are all waxed it saves the expense of mops indeed but i have such falls that i have almost dislocated every joint about me  my neck is stretched out in such a manner that i am apprehensive of having my throat out with the pasteboard  when i remonstrate on any of those articles she stops my mouth by a kiss and says  my dear angel we must have some little regard to appearances  she is as i told you but six years younger than myself yet she dresses dances and drives about as if she was but fiveandtwenty  this however and much more i could bear i deserve it i am contented she shall consume sixandthirty yards more than my old maid hester in the spinning of her gown she may play a shilling a fish at quadrille she may do  aye she may do what she pleases let me have but my study to myself let my nightcap and slippers he restored and i will submit to wear the new coat and the wig every sunday  p s i long to take poor jonas again he used always to ride before me and drunk or sober he knew the shortest way all over the country what signifies whether ones footman wears a wig or his own hair it is true he never blacked either my boots or his own  advice to a young lady respecting the oconomy of her house as you are now tenant at will in a very handsome house are capable of furnishing it in the politest manner and of ruling it by the strictest maxims of economy and decorum permit a friend to give a few cursory hints in an affair of so much importance  the building as you must be convinced is composed of some of the finest materials that were ever beheld and is of course extremely liable to discover every s and spot that may affect it it is erected of a proper beight of a just  and on a regular plan and finished with the mose currat proportions  on the top stands an eminent turret furnished with a room of a globular form which i observe has two ysial windows in the front these are so constructed and to be exceedingly useful they command an extensive prospect and if always kept clean and bright will prove a very great  to your house i advise you not to look through  object that passes by to shut them soon  the and to open them as early as possible in the morning on each  of the turret i observe that there is a small for  company but take particular care that these woe are guarded by a proper sentinel and by no means suffered to stand open as you will otherwise be perpetually crowded with visitors and perhaps with many disagreable ones however let these useful portals never be shut against the advising friend the instructing parent or the supplicating orphan there is a single gate in the front by which all your company is dismissed and this should in general be barred close it is indeed so very public that you can hardly let out any visitor privately and you must be very careful that no suspicious character be seen to quit it lest you draw a scandal on your house whatever company therefore may have forced their way into the sideportals it will be necessary to lay the strictest injunctions of vigilance on the two able porters who stand constantly before the ivory pallisadoes in a livery of the deepest scarlet i have seen some ladies paint the two pannels just below the windows of their houses but i advise you to avoid that custom as the natural colors far exceed every decoration of art  this part of the edifice is supported by a pillar of corinthian marble the base of which is ornamented with a pair of alabaster semiglobes and over these it will be very proper to draw a fine lawn curtain  beneath these is the great hall in which you have a small closet of exquisite workmanship this i suppose is the place of your secret retirement open to none but yourself and some approved friends i advise you to keep this always clean to furnish it well to make it a little library of the best practical authors and to visit it frequently especially when you return from church or leave a circle of acquaintance whom you have met at the teatable  let the outside of your hall not appear like a horse hung round with seutcheons nor be like a coach of state dabed over with tinsel and colorings but let it be plain and near to convince the world that it is kept more for use than ornament  you are sensible miss that time effaces the beauty and demolishes the strength of the noblest structures and therefore do not be alarmed on finding yours subject to the like change doubtless it has often wanted repairs though you have lived in it no longer which is a plain intimation that the house must in a few years fall you may indeed soon be turned out the landlord may give you warning or he may not and as all this is quite uncertain be perpetually prepared and then you need never be afraid of quitting it  one thing i must not forget to observe when you have once left your house no other human being will ever inhabit it but it will be waste and in ruins yet the proprietor has promised some time or other to rebuild it for your reception in a more durable manner but though it will then be constructed with the same materials they are to be so refined and modified by the great architect that the edifice will not be in future liable to any accident or decay and as it is absolutely necessary that your habitation be reared in some other place i heartily wish it may be situated in a finer country under a milder climate and on a spot not exposed to those pitiless storms which injure and too often destroy the best contrived buildings in this sublunary abode  since you must then take it for a term which will never expire  the street sweepers a mock heroic poem by w whitehead esquire i sing of sweepers frequent in thy streets augusta as the flowers which grace the spring or branches withering in autumnal shades to form the brooms they wield preserved by them from dirt from coachhire and the oppressive rheums which clog the springs of life to them i sing and ask no inspiration but their smiles hail unknown youths and virgins unendowd whether on bulk begot while rattled loud the passing coaches or the officious hand of sportive linkboy wide around him dashed the pitchy flame obstructive of the joy or more propitious to the dark retreat of roundhouse owe your birth where natures reign revives and emulous of spartan fame the mingling sexes share promiscuous love and scarce the pregnant female knows to whom she owes the precious burden scarce the sire can claim confused the manyfeaturd child nor blush that hence your origin we trace twas thus immortal heroes sprung of old strong from the stolen embrace by such as you unhousd unclothed unlettered and unfed were kingdoms modeled cities taught to rise firm laws enacted freedoms rights maintained the gods and patriots of an infant world let others meanly chaunt in tuneful song the blackshoe race whose mercenary tribes allured by halfpence take their morning stand where streets divide and to their prosserd stools solicit wandering feet vain pensioners and placemen of the crowd not so you pour your blessings on mankind nor traffic vile be your employment deemed ye last remains of public spirit whose laborious hands uncertain of reward bid kennels know their wonted bounds remove the bordring filth and give the obstructed ordure where to glide what though the pitying passenger bestows his unexpected boon must they refuse the wellcarnd bounty from the obtruded ore proud were the thought and vain and shall not we repay their kindly labors men like them with gratitude unsought i too have often seen in our streets the withered hands of age toil in the industrious task and can we there be thrifty niggards happily they have known far better days and scattered liberal round the scanty pittance we afford them now soon from this office grant them their discharge ye kind churchwardens take their meagre limbs shivering with cold and age and wrap them warm in those blessed mansions charity has raised but you of younger years while vigor knits your laboring sinews urge the generous task nor lose in fruitless brawls the precious hours assigned to toil be your contentions who first in the darkning streets when autumn sheds her earliest showers shall clear the obstructed pass or last shall quit the field when spring distrills her moistning dews prolisick there in vain so may each lusty seavenger ye fair fly ardent to your arms and every maid ye gentle youths be to your wishes kind whether ostrees fishy sumes allure as venus tresses fragrant or the sweets more mild and rural from her stall who toils to feast the sages of the samian school nor ever may your hearts elate with pride desert this sphere of love for should ye youths when blood boils high and some more lucky chance has swelled your stores pursue the tawdry band that romp from lamp to lamp  for health expect disease for sleeting pleasure soul remorse and daily nightly agonizing pains in vain you call for aesculapius aid from white cross alley or the azure posts which beam through haydon yard the god demands more ample ofrings and rejects your prayer and you ye fair o let me warn your breasts to shun deluding men for some there are great lords of counties mighty men of war and welldressd courtiers who with leering eye can in the face begrimd with dirt discern strange charms and pant for cynthia in a cloud but let lardellas fae avert you own lardella once was fair the early boast of proud st giless from it is ample pound to where the column points the sevenfold day happy thrice happy had she never known a street more spacious but ambition led her youthful footsteps artless unassurd to whitehalls fatal pavements there she plied like you the active broom at sight of her the coachman dropped his lash the porter often forgot his burden and with wild amaze the tall wellbooted sentry armed in vain leaned from his horse to gaze upon her charms but fate reserved her for more dreadful ills a lord beheld her and with powerful gold seduced her to his arms what cannot gold effect when aided by the matrons tongue long tried and practiced in the trade of vice against the unwary innocent awhile dazzled with splendour giddy with the height of unexperienced greatness she looks down with thoughtless pride nor sees the gulf beneath but soon too soon the highwrought transport sinks in cold indifference and a newer face alarms her restless lovers sickle heart distressed abandoned whither shall she fly how urge her former task and brave the winds and piercing rains with limbs whose daintier sense shrinks from the evening breeze nor has she now sweet innocence thy calmer heartfelt aid to solace or support the pangs she feels why should the weeping muse pursue her steps through the dull round of infamy through haunts of public lust and every painful stage of illfeignd transport and uneasy joy too sure she tried them all till her sunk eye lost it is last languish and the bloom of health which revelld once on beautys virgin cheek was pale disease and meagre penury then loathed deserted to her lifes last pang in bitterness of soul she cursed in vain her proud betrayer cursed her fatal charms and perished in the streets from whence she sprung the merry monarch or khthood a jest a tale when good king jemmy wore the british crown a pleasant jest for highest wit went down a pun a quibble a conundrum quaint often made a bishop of a man no saint smart repartees passed all for sterling coin and wit was then as unrefind as wine the king himself so rest his merry soul could crack his joke  nor would his mirth control but laugh full hearty if the jest were keen nor could the care of kingdoms give him spleen thus story tells  as he rode out one day to chase the stag he lost by chance his way the courtiers eager scour the spacious field while duty there did unto pleasure yield alone king jemmy with his usual grace kept stepping onward in a common pace till near two clowns he came who worked full hard hedging a close behind a farmers yard they spied the king and from his awkward mien thought he some needy northern lord had been gend men quoth he  and then he made his bow ken ye which way the nobles rode just now my business leads me unto our king james i know him not in troth quoth one it seems he only minds his countrymen while we labor thus hard to furnish out their glee  ride on quoth the other man you will find him out surrounded by a gaudy scottish rout fear not thy fortune jemmy loves a loon and thoure some starving knight that wants a boon  weel fare ye quoth the king and of my weard goud character ye to your prince affeurd and ise wat weel it all gangs to his ear  why then quoth dick for once the truth he will hear so saying to a grove that lay in sight on rode the king and there thought fit to light outstretchd his royal limbs upon the place and stepped full sweetly on the verdant grass no policies of state disturbed his mind but that good prince snord loud as any hind until the chase was over and stag was dead when duty found a place in courtiers head nor had the noble train long sought their lord ere fast they found him on the gay greensward hasty they then from reeking coursers spring while with a smile up rose the jocund king my lords quoth he as you rid yonder by did you not hedging two auld carles spy in leather doublets clad  my liege we did quoth one  see then said he them hither lead straight they obeyed and as they dragged each clown ads me quoth dick to ralph we are both undone you man we took for some poor begging knight is the kings grace  ods fish quoth ralph youre right we shall be hanged what will become of sue she will pine to death  and so will margery too them at a distance when the monarch spied he took the whynyard from his martial side behind him on the ground it is point he stayed as not much caring to survey the blade low on their knees the trembling wretches crawl and sweat with fear their heads should lower fall your names quoth jemmy in an angry tone mine is poor dick  mine ralph a sorry clown  weel quoth the king and gave their necks a strap sir ralph  sir richard  ye may both get up now knights ye are and of my soul i ween two peurer knights in scotland never were seen a loud applause the fawning crowd expressed to see two titles to  to make one jest the decision a tale for widows clarissa sprightly once and gay now signed the tedious hours away she mourned the kindest husband gone the husband much  but more the man dark weeds concealed the fair from view yet mightily became her too she veiled her pretty blubbered face and wept her dear  with such a grace but lo young florimond appears to dry the joyless widows tears his suit she heard with warm disdain protested all his hopes were vain her hands she wrung her robe she rent and wept and wondered what he meant yet through the drop that drowned her eye it is said there shone a spark of joy and sage diviners could foretell that florimond might yet do well a scruple now disturbed her head whether it were a sin to wed queries and doubts her brain possessed and busy conscience broke her rest so to resolve this knotty case she seeks the curate of the place a casuist  deep  of judgment sound yes famed for parts  the parish round clarissa with the rising sun approached her friend and thus begun  full sixty times has yonder light arose as often has sunk in night since the lamented hour that gave my faithful consort to the grave and sure no second love shall ever efface the image still so dear clarissa to his memory just for ever shall revere his dust yet cruel prudence may require what else were foreign to desire and midst a weight of cares you know what can a helpless woman do my heedless servants slight my call my farmers break my houses fall and florimond with winning air tells me they want a husbands care what does my learned doctor say  why marry sure  without delay  but should the lover prove unkind a tyrant over a tender mind how hard my lot condemned to mingle tears with my cup  why then live single but what if an obdurate fair should drive a lover to despair you know the foolish freaks of men i dread the thought  nay take him then but should he squander my estate and pawn my jewels rings and plate and witless i by folly led be turned adrift to beg my bread the doctor versed in womankind perceived the workings of her mind madam he cries when truth we seek all argument is often weak when reasons weigh on either part opinion vainly tries her art so till descending truth prevails she sits suspended over the scales a way more speedy shall be tied a tongue shall speak that never lyd know madam then my parishbell is famous for advising well whatever the point in question be it hits the matter to a t thus as it dictates by it is tone you sure must wed  or lie alone now towered the church in haste they go the widow cheerful  but so so yet vows whatever the answer given she piously will yield to heaven the doctor too exhorts the fair to listen and decide with care and now the mystery to unfold he turned the key the bell he tolled the widow mused and knit her brow  well madam pray what think ye now here first she sobbd and wiped her eye then labored out a doleful sigh think doctor why the case is plain alas i find resistance vain  ah florimond and must i yield in heaven it is said our doom is sealed yet not by choice  by fate i am won the will of heaven be ever done the bell ordains thee to my bed for hark it fairly bids me wed  dear doctor then  i speak with sorrow  be sure you be at home tomorrow think you the simple tale too long then hear the moral of my song the moral to no sex confined regards alike all human kind sly passion and distempered sense usurp the form of evidence and truth and falsehood good and ill receive their tincture from the will man boasts his reasons power in vain the pageant drags a hidden chain a varied shape each object wears just as he wishes hopes or fears his deepest thought his vaunted rule is passions slave or follys fool it is hence we blindly can approve the very faults of those we love it is hence we blindly can debate the noblest deeds of those we hate abroad thus works perverted will at home our views are darker still and actions deemed absurd in thee are prudent wise and just in me selflove adores her own caprice still deifies each darling vice and by the color of a name removes at once the guilt and shame the prodigal is generous free the miser boasts economy gay the debauched the proud is great the bold oppressor hates a cheat the fawning slave obliges all and mad revenge is honors call thus passion shoots through every part the brain is tainted with the heart weak judgment falls before temptation and reason  is but inclination the country justice a tale sir john a country magistrate of good round belly hobbling gait well know at every merry meeting famed both for justice and for eating was most severe as stories tell us aga often the younger sprightly fellows when frolicksome for youth are wild they chanced to get the maids with child would sternly take the cause in hand and both the parties reprimand with utmost rigor would enforce the rigid laws that came in course nor ever in the least excuse that slight faux pas so much in use and yet by some twas shrewdly thought that he himself was sometimes naught and those who heard what neighbors said had little doubt he kissed his maid but strangely time brings things about as murder some odd time will out and so it chanced one luckless night when love unusual fired the knight his post so boldly he maintained the fatal growing proof remained for scarce six months were gone and past ere betty swelled about the waist but warned before of this disaster the fearful wench informed her master who  as it is the sinners way to put far off the evil day  neglects her till so large it made her that to the neighbors it betrayed her now good sir john begins to stir and trembles for his character advises betty full of care the bastard not on him to swear and if she will put disgrace aside he will for the child and her provide betty whose conscience wondrous nice is is puzzled in this doubtful crisis but truth beyond her virtue prizes and the offer secretly despises yet as her circumstances lay conjectured twas the wisest way resentment and her thoughts to smother and say she will lay it to another the knight thus eased commits each whore and acts with rigor as before and though often told of bettys failing pretends to disbelieve their railing till time run on and betty grew so large to each impartial view that now the danger was the same against the cautious knights good name when now to keep his fame he thought and ordered betty to be brought the quorum sat the blushing wench in public stood before the bench sir john who thought himself secure began to thunder out his power demands aloud who has beguiled the unhappy maid and got the child the books held out she stoops to kiss it  and if i must disclose who is it she cried  that has my truth beguiled sir john is father to the child now sudden grief surprise and shame over whelm the knight and blast his fame the tale each standrous tongue reveals and swells the story as it tells to truth they add a thousand lies and shame increasing as it flies each girl unpunished stains her gown and bastards swarm throughout the town ode to nastiness o goddess

here lies a peck which some men say was first of all a peck of clay this wrought with skill divine while fresh became a curious peck of flesh through various forms it is maker ran then adding breath made peck a man full sixty years peck felt lifes bubbles till death relieved a peck of troubles thus fell poor peck as all things must and here he lies  a peck of dust a curious epitaph here lies interred a friend to both sexes who from a strict obedience to the fundamental laws of nature dedicated himself entirely to the use of his superiors framed for the good of the public he proved a useful subject to the king a constant support to the constitution and an unwearied benefactor to every body he was so well acquainted with the affairs of the house of commons and so necessary in their operations that there was no motion made to which he was not privy he was easy of access to all and though his chief companions were of a loose disposition the most modest ladies scrupled not to visit him on any urgent occasion so great were his good offices in short he relieved the poor and needy and the rich he sent empty away
