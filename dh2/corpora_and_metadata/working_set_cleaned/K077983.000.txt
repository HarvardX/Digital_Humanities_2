arcana mooreana or a succinct and lucid discourse of the origin essence situation symptoms causes and cure of the cholick in all its various denominations different kinds degrees and complications  done by mr john moore apothecary at the pestle and mortar in abchurchlane near umbardstreet  natura legibus esse medicinae leges consentaneas medicus remedia conert non solum naturae minister sed interdum ut opifex primarius london printed for the ahor       the epistle dedicatory to the right reverend father in god dr john moore lord bishop of ely may it please your lordship an indispensible necessity obliging me to vindicate my reputation in the knowledge and practice of physic against the malicious calumnies and detractions of my enemies who are only those of my own profession and such as are unwarily prejudiced by their false and scandalous insinuations i hope i shall not be charged either with vanity or rashness in publishing these brief essays which are designed for no other end but that by reading this little mannual those that are strangers to my person may be convinced that in studying physic i have followed such learned guides and patterns by whose directions and examples and my own experience joined with a tolerable capacity and an indefatigable industry and diligence that i am legally qualified for the exercise of the art i profess maugre the inveterate malice of all opposers  my lord my life and conversation i bless god being unattackable even by envy it self and so being no reproach to the name i have the honor to bear and your lordship being celebrated for your exemplary piety charity and profound knowledge in physic as well as in all other learned and useful arts and sciences and consequently a proper and sufficient judge of the contents of the following treatise  i have humbly presumed to dedicate it to your good lordship in great sincerity but in very plain language for if nature had been more kind and liberal to me in eloquent and rhetorical expressions i durst not have used them to your lordship who takes more delight in doing good to others than in reading deserved panegyricks on your self  and therefore if your lordship is pleased to pardon or excuse my confidence in this address and favorably accept the tender of this diminutive tract i shall esteem that great condescension as an eternal obligation and honor conferred upon  my good lord your lordships most devoted humble servant john moore  a practical discourse showing the origin seat symptoms cause etc the introduction in defense of the author if ever any person upon the face of the universe that dedicated his whole life to the doing good and rendering himself beneficial to mankind has reason to complain of the ill and barbarous usage he has encountered from men of his own profession and others of a superior station that pretend authority to license or suppress all practioners in the noble and useful arts of pharmacy and administering physic i am the man for ever since i took my leave of the old and useless way of giving physic as too many others do blindfold by traditional prescriptions and made it my whole study and business to keep up an entire correspondence and agreement between art and nature theory and practice and made exact and particular observations in the difference of diseases the variety of symptoms casual accidents and the diversity of constitutions in humane bodies and have followed the dictates of a wellgrounded experience in finding out the essence of diseases and the efficacy of proper medicines to cure them the whole tribe of common practioners and some graduated professors of physic that live lazing upon the little knowledge that comes by tradition and by stuffing their bills and patients with nauseous repetitions of unexperienced and consequently ineffectual medicines have both unsufferably calumniated traduced and slandered me with many ridiculous stories and unjust censures as well as loaded me with such hard and reproachful names as none but the bountiful bestowers of them can deserve so that i am forced to prevent others from being prejudiced by false reports and malicious insinuations to take this way of vindicating my reputation against the insults of envious men who are as utter strangers to my person and abilities as themselves are from the common principles of modesty civility and good manners  i could with great facility recriminate upon my enemies but i never thought a billingsgate dialect any ornament or an advantageous character to a sober chriftian which is seldom used but by a buisy sort of tatling animals who are out of humor with every body because their own ill nature will not suffer em to be pleased with themselves let maevius and bavius then admire one another and rail at all the world besides i shall for the future be unconcerned at those who are as full of unjust reproaches as they are void of good breeding i wish to be hated by selfinterested slanderers and their abettors for the same reason for which i desire to be beloved by all ingenious well meaning honest men under all denominations as for the rest i shall say with the poet  urged by the base i am unconcerned the while at least regard it with a scornful smile twere mean to think of vengeance on the vile however since i know not how far their hatred inveterate and implacable malice may extend to my prejudice among those that know not my veritable character i shall here employ a few lines to answer all the objections they have raised and industriously scattered to blast my reputation in the practice of physic which i have followed with great success for many years and which the worst of my enemies cannot deny without assurance enough to affirm that the sun is not risen when to their shame it shines in their faces from its illustrious meridian  objections against the author the first quarter in which my professed enemies attack me is that i am but an apothecary it is true i lay claim to no greater title and yet cannot forbear saying that that objection is ridiculous since being an apothecary well versd in pharmacy in the knowledge of drugs and the composition of medicines is the most certain and regular step toward the making of a good physician as has been proved by many examples in london and other places where men that servd their times to apothecaries and kept shop many years have afterward took their degree of doctor in one of our own universities and practiced with as great applause and it may be with more success than the rest of their only graduated brethren nor is this method unobserved in other learned employments for many wise men say that the way to make an able counselor is first to educate him as a clerk to an attorney having thus blown off this ignorant and contemptible objection i proceed to the second which is that i never had an university education but am a mere ignoramus as they are pleased to phrase it but how will they prove their latter allegation did they ever examine into my learning and ability do they know my incapacity to perform what i undertake if they did without doubt i should long since have heard of it in louder terms than by private whispers malicious insinuations and secret calumnies and aspersions but such is their hatred that what they dare not aver to my face or attempt to prove by argument they liberally supply by false reports and forged clandestine stories of my insufficiency against a thousand credible certificates and reputable testimonies to the contrary and these i think sufficient to stop the mouths of detraction and envy in the opinion of all good people and for others that are mislead by my numerous adversaries into uncharitable censures of me let them but consider that my enemies treat me on the score of demetrius for my safe and short way of practice and a great number of patients diminishing their profit they will not wonder that i am condemned in an arbitrary court where malice is the prosecuter interest sits as judge and sordid ignorance is foreman of the jury i confess i have not had the advantage of an academick education but am a sincere lover of learning and desirous of knowledge and though i cannot boast of possessing much yet i can astute all censorious pedants that by conversing with learned men and a well chosen library i take as much pains to increase my knowledge as some of them do by insignificant diversions and notorious debaucheries to lose what they gained if ever they gained any thing but words at the university besides this cavil is wholly impertinent since its well known beyond a possibility of contradiction that i am master of good specificks and established experimented medicines of my own preparing which prescribing physicians cannot pretend to though of the greatest consequence to mankind and whose efficacious virtues i am sure of and can rely upon in the most difficult plunging cases in respect of safety and generally with success and all this confirmed by numerous testimonies of cured patients which i am of opinion is all that ought t be required of a good physician and yet for want of the empty title of doctor and a coach and equipage i must it seems be called quack and emperick by chose doni of the profession who have not much more skill in the true practice of physic which i take to be the cure of diseases than what they collect from the old exploded methodus medendi which when the world grows wiser will vanish into its original nothing and give place to solid certain and veritable experience in the cure of diseases  and that i may contribute to this great end of advancing useful knowledge in physic and that my enemies may not think i am reduced to a perpetual silence in my own just defense by their vain threatenings and injurious misrepresentations of my person and capacity for the practice of physic i have taken up a resolution to print several discourses upon those diseases that god has blessed me with the knowledge of and given me wonderful success in their cures that have frequently baffled the endeavors of many eminent professors and shall begin with a treatise upon the cholick  now in discoursing this subject to avoid all unnecessary and over nice and curious distinction and definitions that rather puzzle mens intellects than benefit their understandings i shall under the general name vulgarly called cholick treat of it as an accidental and particular distemper arising from an evident cause alone and without a previous disposition in any person indifferently for so alterations in the sex nonaturalia often raise great commotions in the viscera of the belly with extremity of pain after that i shall consider this disease in its procartick or preexistent cause as cooperating with others that are subsequent which will necessarily lead me to particular discourses upon the various kinds and the several species of this distemper under the denominations of the cholick in the stomach the hysteric cholick the scorbutic cholick the iliack passion the caeliack cholick a diarrhea a lientary a dysentry etc all which distempers i shall treat particularly and to avoid confusion and over burthening the memory under every head i shall show the origin seminium or minera of each disease what part of the body is primarily affected then proceed to the symptoms and method of cure and conclude with some observations and examples wherein my own medicines have been wonderfully successful which i always keep ready prepared by me to dispose of to all that think fit to come or send for them  the essence or nature of the cholick the cholick called in greek  in latin collica passio because by some physicians it is supposed though falsely to have its seat wholly in some part or other of the second of the great guts called colon is a vellication or severe griping twitching gnawing pain in certain parts of the abdomen which commonly produce vomitings cramps and contractions almost of all the viscera of the belly sometimes the navel and its neighboring parts are drawn inward accompanied with pains as if they were boared with a gimlet sometimes they swell being blown up with the excess of wind the intestines by an inverted motion of the fibers are often drawn upwards insomuch that the belly being extremely bound discharges little or nothing at all nay though it be frequently provoked to do it by glysters and suppositories yet it does not easily throw out its contents  that the stomach is likewise convulsed with the duodenum and gall bladder manifestly appears from the plentiful vomiting of yellow or green choler sometimes the vreters and the bladder which contains the urine are so contracted that during the whole fit the urine is either stopped or voided more sparingly besides the head is grieved with vertiginous effects either preceding or following the invasion of this disease and if the cholick increases and becomes inveterate it often causes pain in the outward members and terminates in a palsy  its direful effects nay the sick commonly endures all kinds of pains one while burning with intolerable heat another time chilled with extreme cold sometimes it seems to be fixed and as it were piercing the loins or ther whiles pricking with wandering repeated thrusts anon distending or beating the loins or only pressing them with the sense of weight or burning corroding rending pain or is troubled either with a continual or interrupted pulsation and afterward returning again or wonderfully writhing and contorting any other way scarce to be expressed by the patient or explained by the physician  now though all the differences occurring in this distemper with its original are very difficult to be assigned numbered or reduced into a certain order and much more to make an exact examination of all the symptoms and causes and thence to give a sollid judgment of every one yet i shall attempt it by exhibiting them from the best authorities and leave the choice to your own election as they are most agreeable to your reason and experience which is the mistress both of the learned and unskilful  the origin of the cholick some are of opinion that the origin of this disease proceeds from the effervescency of vicious blood others from an obstruction of the capillary veins of the stomach and guts by which the blood is forced to stand still in the vessels till at length after a great distention the vessels burst and the blood is effussed which breeds a sensible inflammation and violent pulsation about the part affected others say it arises from an over viscous phlegm mixed with choler offensive both in its saltish acrimony and volatile oiliness by which the viscous phlegm is rarefied into wind and if the excrements are contained beyond their due time they harden and stick to the gut by which the natural ferment is viciated and the windy gusts are more rarefied and being shut up in the cavity of the gut colon it causes a violent distension and contraction of it  some again impute it the disorders and convulsions of the nerves running from the mesenterick plexus which vicious humors as aforesaid lodged in the intestines and those by a foreign irritation of their nerves equally attended by the successive returns of cold and heat cause tearing wringing and ccting pains  others ascribe s original to the abounding acidity and acrimony of the pancreatick juice occasioned by over sharp food eating raw fruits by summer air too hot by winter air too cold or at least too sharp by fear sorrow extreme grief or solicitude of mind by continued watchings which consume the animal spirits and by consequence increasing the acrimony of any humors produce hypocondriack suffocations and also pains severely racking and contorting the guts now the reasons why i cannot agree with many physicians that cholick pains proceed from the sharp and irritative contents of the colon is because those medicines which loosen the belly and copioussly expel featuss and the faeces would undoubtedly give most certain relief the contrary of which too often happens viz that after frequent or violent purging that disease becomes worse nor can i agree with the notion that cholick pains proceed only from the pancreatick juice mixed with choler because it is impossible according to sylvius de la boe that the juice of the pancreas in any manner or degree sour should mix with choler abounding with a bitter and volatile salt therefore  i firmly adhere to the opinion of the learned dr willis who with great reason places the origin of this disease among the effects of the brain and the genus nervosum alleging that certain recrements of the nervous humor falling from the brain by the nerves and passing thence into the mesentry and other foldings of the abdomen are there amassed and heaped together which if they are so gross thick and viscous that they cannot be received and sent away by the lymphaducts or distilled out into the cavities of the intestines by the small branches of the vessels then stagnating and being heaped together by degrees into those parts they arise at length to an irritative plenitude and afterward that matter becoming more degenerate and more offensive by stagnation and growing turged on some occasion or of its own accord or else fermenting with the salinofixd humor sent thither from the blood will torture the patient with very troublesome and painful corrugations in the branches of the nerves and nervous fibers with which the mesentery is innumerably furnished which effects of them do seldom or never cease till the fermenting matter is either discussed or expressed into the cavities of the intestines or at length by care and the application of proper medicines they are utterly subdued  having thus briefly showed you the nature of the cholick in the direful effects it produces together with its origination i shall according to promise proceed to the place that is primarily affected in human bodies  the seat of the cholick senertus and riverius place it in the upper orifice of the stomach which is of exquisite sense by reason of the intermixture of nerves with which it is stored from the vaga sexta from whence branches being communicated to the heart that noble part is also affected by consent and disperses the pain into almost every part internal and external  dr blankard professor of physic at middleburgh in zealand says the cholick is a vehement pain proceeding from an ill disposition of the animal spirits seated in the abdomen but begins in the nervous plexuss or foldings of the mesentery and is by some men falsely imputed to have its residence in the gut colon  michael etmuller late professor of physic in the university of leiptsick says cholick pains and gripings in the great guts are chiefly felt in the colon especially in that part of it toward the circumference of the belly upon the leftside where it is straightened and incurvated and consequently more liable to the blast and shocks of wind and more apt to stop the circulation of the excrements and cause their swelling up into a hard or soft tumor this pain and tumor is frequently imputed to the spleen but erroneously for the colon says he is its usual and proper seat and sometimes it veers about to the rightside of the belly upon the outermost circumference where the same colon pursues its course  sometimes these pains reach only the small guts and then their station is about the navel and center of the belly and are much more violent than those in the great guts if they range not beyond the duodenum or the beginning of the jejunum they are felt in the loins and are often mistaken for nephritick pains or those caused by the convulsion of the mesenterick nerves or tumors or ulcers in the pancreas i dare not say any of these opinions are heterodox because sometime or other pains do possess all the parts above mentioned  however for very good reasons grounded upon many experiments in anatomy i adhere chiefly to doctor willis who says the part in human bodies primarily affected in the cholick is the mesentery and its nervous foldings under the navel which causes cruel pain as if a stake was stuck there or a piercer were making a hole besides round about almost in the whole abdomen by reason of the intestines being variously drawn forward and backward at the same time in different places wandering pains shoot this way and that way and the motion of the fibers being discomposed or inverted as well in those parts as in the primary vessels the belly is in a manner always bound and there follows sometimes a supperssion of urine or very little is made besides the duodenum the gall bladder with its channels and the bottom of the stomach being affected with a cramp and their fibers being drawn upward a frequent vomiting with a copious casting up matter of yellow or greenish color often happens during the fit  in a fit of the cholick also besides pains of the belly there are likewise violent pains of the loins raging in the  ower parts of the back which certainly cannot proceed from the irritation of any intestine but its easy to conceive they may arise from a morbific cause lodged in the mesentery for inasmuch as several considerable nerves of the loins enter into the great nervous folding of the mesentery so from hence not only painful convulsions are conveyed by consent from one part to another but its also probable that certain recrements of the back likewise and of the loins are derived into the mesentery by this passage and that in some sort for this reason scorbutical persons are so very obnoxious to gripes of the belly and looseness that attends it which confirms me in the opinion that the nervous flexus of the mesentery is the first part affected with the cholick and that its seat is not in the cavities or tnicles of the intestines nor the morbifick matter conveyed by the arteries but by nerves  diagnostick symptoms diagnostick signs of the cholick are very sharp pains sometimes moveable and other whiles fixed to a certain place sometimes the pain is in the region of the stomach or in the reins sometimes above and sometimes below the navel so that by the comparison of other signs you must distinguish between the cholick and pains of the stone or spleen which are frequently mistaken one for the other even by physicians themselves  prognostic symptoms of the cholick prognostics of the cholick are vulgarly enough known that is to say an accidental cholick rising from an evident cause alone is commonly safe and admits of an easy cure but an habitual one is not eradicated but with great difficulty as to its disposition so that the fits may return no more for sometimes the fits themselves notwithstanding the application of medicines are very obstinate and continue many days nay weeks and months and sometimes are never cured but by death thus much for signs but since i have branched out this disease into several parts i shall take leave once for all to show how you may distinguish one disease from another by the urine  signs by the urine if the urine is watery it is a nephritick cholick if highly tinctured toward the middle and colored on the surface and the anus is obstinately bound it is a scorbutic cholick if respiration is difficult and the breast afflicted it is a hysteric cholick if the convulsion of the intestines is accompanied with pain extending to the pubes and haunchbone the womb is disordered if the urine is clear and of a reddish yellow it is a choleric cholick if the pain is tearing and the urine milky and pale impregnated with a large sediment the mesenterick nerves are affected  causes of the common cholick the antecedent causes of the common cholick which i only treat of under this head are the disorder and convulsions of the nerves running from the great mesenterick plexus which cause tearing wringing and contracting pains sometimes occasioned by nephritick pains and childbirth when the mesenterick folding being irritated by its concourse with the nerves of the kidneys and the womb antecedent caucauses pulls and contracts both the stomach and guts which it supplies with nerves at other times they are retainers to some fixed permanent habitual cause which though it lie hid for some time has always an ascendant in the body these are either hypochondriack hysteric or scorbutic as i shall further show when i treat particularly of those diseases a part and are owing to the convulsion of the mesenterick plexus to which the intestines are annexed being galled with a peccant acid  procatartick causes the procatartick or preexistent cause of this disease which cooperates with others that are subsequent are two fold first that many recrements or superfluous things are heaped together in the nervous liquor and secondly that they being admitted chiefly into the nerves of the viscera of the belly and so conveyed into the mesentery there create the morbid mineras of this distemper for the former of these generally happening by the distemper of the brain by admitting heterogeneous particles with the nervous juice into its custody the whole animal economy is so disturbed that it cannot evacuate the common superfluities by its ordinary conveyance and this causes the incongruous matter that cannot be sent from the brain to force its passage into the nerves of the par vagum which are open and ready to receive it secondly that this superfluous matter running in this manner into the par vagum of the nerves is deposed in the mesentery or other foldings within the abdomen and necessarily makes the morbid seat in the mesentery  evident causes the evident causes of the cholick are also of two sorts first such as being injurious to the brain and genus nervosum cause the morbifick matter to super abound or secondly by agitating the blood and humors stir up the conglobated mass to pain causing more fervent and sudden effervescencies and here some will imagine i should proceed to discourse the many and diversified occasions by which the pains of the cholick are caused in persons predisposed to them but that would be nauseating the reader with cramben biscoctum having sufficiently done it already in the paragraph enttuled the direful effects of the cholick page the   th  cure of the chlick and now according to the method i have prescribed to my self i am brought to treat of what ought to be the main and principal design of every practitioner in physic in all diseases viz the cure of the disease to compass which great end three primary indications are suggested first to appease the pains in the fit secondly to take away the cause of the disease that the fits may no more or not so frequently return thirdly to reinvigorate the patients strength and fortify his constitution in order to the comfortable enjoyment of life  to appease the torturing pains in the paroxism lenifying and emollient glysters only ought to be frequently injected into the body that the corrugations of the fibers may be mitigated and the raging of the spirits appeased to this end warm milk with sugar or rather molossus or syrup of violets also emollient decoctions of marchmallows herb mercury and the flowers of melilot with oil of almonds also a strong decoction of a sheepshead with the wool on it or calvesfeet are proper to be used sometimes a glyster of mear oil of olives or of linseeds have given ease when others have failed but if this sort of glysters are ineffectual and do not come away or answer their end stronger must be used to force the humors from the little mouths of the arteries for this purpose et carminative or bitter decoctions be prepred in which dissolve electuary diaphoenic diacatholicon or e baccis lauri or species hierae to which liquors its customary to add two or three ounces of the infusion of crocus mettalorum or to a pound of an emollient decoction add of venice turpentine dissolved with the yolk of an egg one ounce or take the urine of a healthy man venice turpentine dissolved one ounce and half and with one ounce of molossus mixed with the rest make a glyster the balsamic particles of the turpentine diffused every where are designed to remove the morbifick or stagnating matter or incline that which is acetous or otherwise degenerate to a better temperament  if the intestines are much contracted by vicious matter lodged within them purgations ought to be prohibited for fear they promoe the contraction and lock up the excrements closer if this case happens in your practice whey or an ounce of the oil of almonds with canary wind and sperma caeti are more effectual than the strongest catharticks if the cholick is attended with a tenacious viscid humor and a heavy boring pain purgatives mixed with attenuating specificks are allowable though i have observed it is better to do so after the fit has made some progress and the symptoms are a little mittigated than just in the beginning especially if the pain is violent but take notice that if the guts are inflamed all laxatives of whatsoever ind are extremely pernicious for a fierc and very violent cholick if it proceed from an inflammation or abscess of some of the intestines generally ushers in a mortal iliack passion  external applications as for external applications against cholicks let the belly and navel be well fomented with liniments of expressed oils mixed with those that are distilled galbanum melted and mixed with the distilled oils of spike and amber plaifters made of tachamahas balsam of peru or that of bay berries with that of tobacco cataplasms of horsedung with oil of rue and quilted bags of milletseeds or of anodyn and aromatic ingretlients are like wise applied to the belly with good success but if the gripes of the belly do not remit by the use of these things you must have recourse to hypnoticks which being given in a sitting dose often gives relief and in continued cholicks notwithstanding some men whose ignorance is as considerable as their insolence loudly clamor against the use of mercurial medicines yet the raising a gentle salivation when the morbifick matter is plentifully gathered together in the nervous plexuss and other places about the abdomen and there sticking fast so as not to be moved by other medicines calomel may be given to the relief of the patient and without reproach to the physician  the preservative indication to refresh the strength and falling spirits of the sick and to order yet a greater apparatus against the disease give liquid laudanum tartarizd at bedtime in a spoonful of the water of camomil flowers drinking after it of the same six spoonfuls and let it be repeated every other or every third night and whilst you are using these medicines for appeasing pains let purging remedies have their due turns to destroy the seminium of the disease and to prevent its return vomiting and purging and in a hot temperament phebotomy ought to be used and instead of baths and sudorificks diureicks may be more advantageously given  and where the cholick is of long continuance and obstinate spawwater coming from ironmines are often used with good success  the vital indication next the vital indication ought to be joined with the curatory and to be now and then interchangeably used with it to that end let remedies be used which support the patients strength refresh his pirits and procure certain times of truce against the fits of the disease let the diseased be dusy supplied with cordials paregoricks and hypnoticks which in the cholick are so absolutely necessary that the patient cannot live without them nor the physician justif himself before the tribunal of his own conscience in constitutions that are not hot spirits of hearthorn of soot of salarmoniack succinated also tincture of antimony or o coral are all very commendable and when the sick is delivered from his pains and has recovered a competency of strength to complete his cure i recommend traveling long journies on horseback or in a coach for such excitations of the parts will strengthen the bowels shake off the relics of the disease and make life pleasant and comfortable till the devouring teeth of time shall destroy that as well as every thing else  the authors own remedies having thus briefly given you the nature origin seat symptoms cause and cure of this excrusiating disease called the cholick with the choicest remedies used by the most celebrated physicians of former ages and the present time i shall now according to promise say something of my own medicines that the bountiful giver of all good things has bless d me with the knowledge of and which i can depend upon from uncontradicted experience in many years practice for the certain cure of this disease in all cureable cases and for giving ease in the most dangerous whose obstinacy and inveteracy will not admit of a perfect cure which remedies are of three sorts a chimical elixir an anticholical cordial water pills and an electuary all safe and salubrious in their nature and effectual in their operations as will be attested by numerous patients that have committed themselves to my care and found extraordinary benefit by them when men of greater names after long trials have been unsuccessful to the infinite trouble and great expense of the diseased both which will be prevented by the method i take in a happy conjunction of speculative and experimental knowledge as the only remedy of the inconveniences that cramp a successful practice  the medicines i exhibit are sure and the knowledge i have of their virtue is not the effect of my reasoning but of my observation so that those that use them will find them successful i say this knowledge is not the fruits of my reason because in reality it is not and further to set this assertion right it cannot be so for in the matter of medicines we have no other way to follow but that of observation for to offer to discover by reason alone the virtue of medicaments is the way never to find what we seek for i theref re apply my self to experience and leave those tricks and vain subtilities which according to quintilian render us like those little insects that are never pleased but when they are among thorns and briars its high time to shake off this school physic which is good for nothing but wrangling and attain a positive physic which is of use in practice by positive physic i dont mean one made up of authorities which consists in knowing the sentiments of diverse authors upon a controverted point as in positive divinity but i mean one that consists of positive matters of fact which teaches what has been often successful in the same circumstances and i may be bold to say that positive physic regulated by method is the true physic  school physic enables practitioners to make smart repartees to come off handsomely in a controverted point and the other makes us sensible and prudent so as to order nothing but what is convenient the out makes us headstrong and opinionative and the other makes us honest physicians who seek for nothing but how to inform our selves and to be useful the one seeks for evasons how to defend himself under a disappointment and the other for medicines to cure distempers the one consults his ideas and the other consults his reason and experience the one makes pedants and the other physicians  a chemical elixir and its operation and first my chemical elixir is in its own nature peculiarly adapted to the cure of the cholick because its innate virtues are powerful in allaying pains taking away the cause of the disease and reinvigorating the patients strength and refreshing his spirits by which means and not by any narcotick quality in the medicine nature is enabled to expel the morbifick matter lodge d in the nervous plexuss of the mesentery and to subdue and conquer the disease this elixir also is endued with an excellent quality to purify the blood and nervous liquors and keep them in a due and regular crasis in order to prevent the engendring of morbifick matter strengthens the brain and the nervous foldings of the abdomen and removes the present procatarxis of the cholick and hinders the invasions of pains for the future so that they shall seldom or never return afterward  how to be taken and its happy effects which elixir is to be taken ten drops at a time when assaulted by cholick pains in five or six spoonfuls of generous wine smooth clear ale or well brew d tablebeer every half hour till the pain is abated and then forbear taking any more drops for that time unless the pain returns this quantity of drops is proper for men but the fair sex must take but five or six drops at a time in two or three spoonfuls of either of the above mentioned liquors observing the same rules as are given to men but if the sick are inclined to vomit up whatever they take let the patient take the same quantity of drops in a smaer quantity of liquor some persons of both sexes can take a greater number of drops than others and in violent fits of the cholick if the patient has not ease with a small number of drops let them add two drops every time they take them till easy then take no more that time as to the quantity of the drops the patient is the proper judge who finding what number of drops best agrees with his constituion his own reason will induce him in all effects to stick to that quantity  when either man or woman takes my elixir in the day time let them lie down upon a bed dispose themselves to rest and if they find their stomachs any way disordered the longer they repose the sooner they will find refreshment and ease  if the sick enter into a course of taking my elixir to eradicate this distemper and put a final end to his tormenting pains let him take four drops at night when he is going to bed in a glass of some of the vehicle before named or in bohe tea and continue so to do by adding one drop every successive night till he has imbibed  0  0 or  0 drops or at least the certain number that agrees with him and adhere to that till he finds himself recovered always lying long in bed in the morning that the elixir may the sooner produce its desired happy effect  an advertisement to waterdrinkers further if the sick has at any time found some benefit by drinking spawwater and is desirous to continue it because his bowels are too hot let him put six drops of my elixir into half a pint of spawwater and drink it going to bed for a month together for this elixir is the best medicine in the world to make all mineral waters pass off well and quickly by urine or seige which if they stay long in the body by taking up their quarters in the head or feet they will cause the vertigo or gout as is often found by dreadful experience which may serve as a cautionary advertisement to all that accustom themselves for diversion or necessity sake to drink tunbridge epsom dullege kensington islington northhall bath northamptonshire derbyshire or yorkshirewaters that they always carry a small bottle of my elixir along with them for prevention of such ill accidents as frequently come to pass by drinking those waters alone and to effect more safely certainly and speedily their intentions in drinking those mineral waters which for want of using my elixir with them generally prove ineffectual  this elixir a name taken from the arabic word eleeschir signifying powerful is also effectual against the stone gravel and bloody urine stops vomiting and a looseness and is a proper medicine against chatars coughs and all diseases incident to the head and breast it continues its whole virtue in all climates and consequently is fit to be carried as it has been to the east or west indies to any of the northern countries the mediteranean or the southseas it will last more than twenty years and no family that has experienced its virtues in many others as well as this distemper will be without it  the authors cordia cholick waters and since in this disease all things though properly enough contrived and invented do not agree with all persons nor please in in the same form of composition and that some palates disrelish what others imbibe with pleasure so there is sometimes a necessity of changing and altering medicines in respect of their form as well as ingredients in their composition that they may more effectually operate upon the different vicious humors and on the various parts affected  to answer all these ends i invented my cordial anticholical water whose virtues far exceed the common tincture of steel and of antimony and amber so much extolled in the cure of the cholick because after a peculiar manner it gives ease by expelling the viscous recrements in the great mesenterick plexus to which the intestines are annexed and allays the griping pains that follow the irregular cure of fevers which are caused by transferring the morbifick matter to the glandules of the mesentery and the subsequent irritation of its nerves this anticholical water or solar liquor has also both a diuretic and carminative quality and has admirable effects both in tender and robust constitutions and i often give it with great success either it self or mixed with other proper specificks as a spur in hot discrasies of the viscera with a predominancy of adust sulphur as also in flitting scorbutical and irregular boilings of the blood and nervous juice which seldom or never fails of doing good in the most desperate cases i have met with in many years practice  how to be taken this water is to be taken by two or three spoonfuls at any time when the sick is grieved with the cholick either by it self or put into a glass of warm ale or burnt white wind and being repeated as occasion requires the physician will accomplish his main end and the patient if he is a person of common ingenuity gratitud and honesty will not grudge his expenc of time or money in purchasing so efficacious remedy  the third nostrum i employ for the cure of the cholick i call pillulae anticolicae or anticholical pills they are compounded of the choicest ingredients in the whole materia medica and require a long time and great care and pains in their preparation the mass being an extract and no common composition as will appear in their operation and the happy effects produced by them now you having read in the foregoing discourse that in some cases and especially when the intestines are much contracted by viscous matter contained in them that purging medicines are not to be used and that all other cases for the cure of the cholick strong catharticks are absolutely necessary to avoid these extremes i have chosen the golden mean and so contrived my anticholical pills by mixing attenuating and molifying ingredients with purgatives that they will work but gently though very effectually in order to discuss or expel the peccant humors by degrees without offering violence to nature by being over hasty in the cure and to that end administering over powerful purgatives which rather weaken the patient than mitigate his pains or diminish his distemper but my pills are hermetically compounded and at the same time both throw out the sharp offening humors corroborate the stomach fortify the spirits and strengthen the whole body against the future invasion of the disease as the only safe and easy way to a perfect cure which these pills taken according to the following directions very seldom ve behind them  directions for taking the pills they are to be taken one pill late at night at the time of going to rest every third or fourth night and if that pill does not work pretty early in the morning take one or two pills more every two hours till they operate gently but if it makes the patient sick in his stomach and does not purge him let him dissolve an ounce of epsom salt or six drams of the lenitive electuary in a pint of water gruel or muttonbroath and drink it bloodwarm the pills will have the same effect if they are forced to be purged off two three or four stools is sufficient for one time keep very warm and drink nothing cold that day after taking them let the sick drink large draughts of thin chicken broth mutton broth or water gruel or for want of them posset drink to dilute the sharp humors cast them out or their acrimony being taken off reduce them to a better temper which you will soon find if this course is duly repeated as often as there is occasion and when there is none take no more pills for i dont give them for lucre of money but to answer the intention of healing for therein consists my interest these pills are good for the scurvy pains in any part of the body kings evil corrupt humors in any part of the body the itch leprofie old ulcers worms gravel stones and in other cases where purging is necessary  the fourth remedy those days wherein the patient does not purge i give a cordial electuary which i call electuarium anticolica or my anticholical electuary which is the fourth remedy for the cure of this disease and which seldom fails if the disease is cureable this electuary being endued with such rare uncommon and well experiencd virtues agreeable to the dictates of nature and art and so significantly adapted to the cure of the cholick in all its various kinds where purging is necessary or unnecessary and dangerous that the patient will seldom be perfectly cured without it because as i have found by repeated experience that when all other remedies prescribed by the best hands have been ineffectual this electuary has done the work by corroborating the stomach correcting its vicious fermentation retrieving its depraved appetite and restoring its almost lost tone to a regular and sanative crasis  directions for taking this electuary this electuary is sometimes also to be taken in the morning on an empty stomach its dose is about the quantity of a nutmeg fasting an hour after it and again at four or five in the afternoon for  0     0 or  0 days when you use no purgatives eat what diet is most nourishing and sits light upon the stomach and abstain from nothing so much as milk and stale beer and now i might be very copious in the commendation and praise of these four remedies invented by and i believe only known to my self and are disposed of at no place but my dwelling house but that persons who know me not may not think i harangue to promote my own profit in selling them i shall wave it for the present and leave every man that buys and uses them to give them what character they deserve for when i have said all i can wise men will not regard what is said of them but what cures have been and may be accomplished by them and from hence i proceed to observations and examples of persons cured of the cholick by the regular use of my before named remedies of which its needless to give you great numbers though i am plentifully furnished with them because the public bas almost weekly notice of persons cured by me in certificates under the hands of my patiens well attested and printed in the public news papers  examples of persons cured a gentlewoman of good reputation extremely afflicted with the cholick for many years after she had taken as she thought the best advice that could be given in london was recommended to my care for the cure of her cholick i gave her antimonial emeticks chalybeats catharticks and alcalious medicines but without any effect she continuing still in a sad and deplorable condition while she was empty she had an abatement of her pain but she no sooner eat but her pains returned and continued till her food was digested at the same time when she labored under this disease she was often overwhelmed with vapors often complained of pain between her shoulders and in other parts and well she might for considering the situation of the parts i found that when she was full her stomach pressed upon the pancreas which is a sort of a pillow to keep the stomach from rubbing against the vertebres of the back and soon after discovered that the pancreas and pilorus were the parts affected occasioned by the acidity of the pancreas and the unctiousness of the gall which had produced an ulcer in the pancreas which with the pylorus was full of matter and when i had interchangeably given her my forenamed arcanas she threw out at times upward and downward a prodigious quantity of pus and then administering proper pacificks and healers she was perfectly cured retired into the country where she continues in health to this day  this gentlewoman being unwilling to have her name published i will not disobtige her in doing it and shall take this opportunity to satisfy the public that i never print any persons name without their leave or a testimony under the patients hand but if any person seems to doubt the truth of it his curiosity may be satisfied by her brother a merchant who was an eyewitness of the cure and dwells at humberton in the parish of hackney in middlesex  grace wife of thomas hogs weaver dwelling in churchstreet in coverletstreet next house to the sign of the lions was troubled with the cholick six whole years together in which time she had the advice of several physicians but they doing her no good at last she applied her self to me and i cured her out of mere charity who has since been so grateful as to recommend several other patients to me who were in better circumstances in regard of wealth who all as well as her self have een perfectly cured by the use of my aforenamed medicines  a tradesman in the city of london who had suffered intolerable cholical pains and had taken several medicines from his own physician and apothecary for a considerable time was induced to apply himself to me and i gave him ease immediately and in a very short time after perfectly cured him those that doubt the truth of this matter if they think sit to enquire of me i shall direct them to the person himself that was cured who will readily attest the truth of what i have here asserted to the satisfaction of any person that is not obliged by interest to show himself incredulous  the cholick in the stomach having now finished what i had to say of an accidental cholick according to the method proposed i am obliged to treat of the cholick as complicated or joined with other diseases and that which leads the van is the stomachical chotick and that very justly because the minera of all chronical diseases are to be sought in the stomach and if the upper orifice of it which is of exquisite sense by reason of the intermixture of nerves with which it is plentifully furnished from the vaga sexta branches whereof being communicated to the heart that noble part being affected then the disease is called in greek  vel  and in latin cardiacus dolor the pain of the heart but if the lower orifice called pylorus be affected it is called dolor seu colica ventriculi pain or the cholick in the stomach more especially if it proceed from wind  causes of the cholick in the stomach the internal causes of this disease sometimes proceed from great oppletion and pain of the stomach sometimes from frequent and violent vomiting which arises from the chyle there degenerated into a mass of corruption but oftener from the morbifick matter brought thither either by the conveyance of the blood or also of the nervous juice and either deposed within the cavity of the stomach or fixed in the plexuss of the nerves and in the membranes appertaining to it sometimes worms gnawing the tunicles of the stomach cause this disease or wind lodged in the cavity of the stomach which causes swellings and painful distension or from sharp phlegm or green and black choler whose sharp vapors cause pain or from corrupt matter from an imposthume in the liver or the breast diseases of the stomach and parts adjoining ill humors from the whole body as in fevers choler from the liver melancholy from the spleen salt phlegm from the head all these may be the causes of the cholick in the stomach  the external causes of this malady may be corrupt nourishment viands too hot that breed wind or choler meat taken in too large quantity poison or strong sharp and dangerous medicines uncorrected  symptoms of the cholick in the stomach diagnostick signs are pain in the ensiformis or lower part of the breast bone which signify that the upper orifice of the stomach is affected with very sharp pain that will not suffer the patient to take any rest and sometimes cause an inveterate headache the megrim vertigo and the epilepsy in the other parts of the stomach the symptoms are not so violent but are truly cholical and exactly resemble that disease in its utmost latitude  prognostic symptoms are ominous for this disease is more dangerus than any other disease of the stomach and the danger is greater if it is accompanied with a fever for in such a case according to hippocrates death is at hand its least dangerous if it proceeds from worms though even in that sometimes dangerous symptoms appear and the patient dies in short the prognostics are usually the symptoms of hypocondriack illness and if they happen upon the recovery of a disease portends its relapse if they come from wind that cannot be removed a dry dropsy follows if they stink horribly they are very malignant and contagious  cure of a cholick in the stomach the method of curing a stomachical cholick if it be not grown obstinate inveterate and beyond the power of medicines to give relief is by considering the cause of the disease to prescribe medicines that are proper to remove it  if wind is the cause carminative clysters are exhibited to discuss it and moderate the violent pains in the stomach caused by it and if the wind be accompanied with flushings in the face and excessive heat spirit of nitre dulcisied with spirit of wine and impregnated with the virtue of carminative simples after sylvius s method is said to be an incomparable remedy inveterate acid belchings are put off by five or six pepper corns being taken every morning fasting if the wind proceed from a thick stubborn mucilage asthmatical syrups and michael s elixir for the stomach are very proper to which you may add externally fomentations with oil of chamomel and of the carminative seeds or with a mixture of aniseedwater spirit of wine camphorated and treacle  if a viscous stinking or otherwise offensive matter be cast up by vomit and there be suspicion that the cause lies in the cavity of the stomach it is proper to give a gentle vomit of wine of squills or of salt of vitriol or the offending humors may be purged off by stool by stomachical catharticks adapted pro re nata but if the matter sticks deeply and firmly within the membranes or foldings of the nerves diaphoreticks or specificks that moderate the effervescencies of the salts are more prevalent and ought to be administered at proper times as the physician employed shall find occasion not forgetting twice or thrice a day to apply fomentations to the region of the stomach with woolen cloths dipped in the warmed liquid medicine last above named and wrung forth for that will much contribute to the abatement of the patients griping intolerable pains  in the next place it will be expected that here i should say something of a stomachical cholick caused by worms gnawing the tunicles of the stomach but i shall wholly omit it at present because the next physical discourse i shall publish shall be a treatise of the worms which i am now preparing for the press in the mean time if any person young or old that is troubled with them and desires to be rid of those vexations and dangerous inmates that render life so uneasy if he please to come or send to me he may be supplied with antivermetick medicines of my own preparing that will effectually eject those vile inhabitants under every denomination  the authors own medicines but to return from this digression the method i have shown in the general practice of physic by the best physicians of the present age in the foregoing paragraphs is what i observe my self though the medicines i give are entirely of my own inventing compounding and preparing and the efficacy whereof i can rely upon for a cure if curable of this dangerous disease for though in all cholical distempers my elixir cholickwater pills and electuary will have their turns yet am i not unprovided of other medicines to assist effectually in the cure when the cholick is complicated with other diseases and consequently indigitates the use of others as the cholick varies in its name cause and parts affected  for these reasons and because in stomachical cholicks proceeding from viscous stinking matter lodged in the cavity of the stomach a vomit seems absolutely necessary to dislodge the offending humor i am always provided of an emetick of such an universal virtue that it answers all the intentions of nature and art in vomiting and leaves no relics for another invasion behind it which medicine will never lose its virtue and consequently may be sent to the remotest parts of the universe and private families may keep it by them to use when they have occasion  where the corrupted matter in a stomachical cholick sticks firm and deep within the membranes or foldings of the nerves and indigitates the use of diaphoreticks or such medicines as moderate the effervescencies of the salts for those purposes i have a mineral remedy which i exhibit sometimes in powder other whiles in the form of an electuary and at other times in a decoction or syrup as they best agree with the patients palate which works almost miraculously in this disease and so cleanse purify and strengthen the stomach and assist it in the work of fermentation that it expels all noxious humors whatever and retains what conduces to a vigorous constitution and a durable state of health  these great things i am sensible my numerous enemies which are chiefly persons of my own profession or such unthinking people as are prejudiced by their malicious false stories will call idle vain bosting but those that have experienced and tried my medicines will do m justice in a modester and juster character and esteem my remedies as nonpareils  the hysterical cholick this disease being commonly known by the tormenting pains that always accompany it might reasonably save me the labor of giving and my reader the loss of time in perusing them however in compliance with my promise i shall give him one of the many observations i have made and examples i am able to produce  john gregory cabinetmaker in philiplane in the parish of st alphage near londonwall being grieved with the cholick in his stomach attended with extraordinary pain in the ensiformis or lower part of the breast bone which was sufficient reason to induce me to be of opinion that the upper orifice of the stomach was affected and giving him proper medicines of my own he no sooner took them according to my directions but he found ease immediately and continuing the use of them a very short time he was restored to his former health and was able to follow his business which he was incapable of doing for five months time before he applied himself to me though he had taken many medicines of others without receiving any benefit by them but now enjoys perfect health the only comfort of life  this disease called by the greeks  and by the latins vteri stangulatio or colica hystericalis the histerical cholick or fits of the mother is not to be imputed to the ascent or rising of the womb according to the vulgar expression nor to the impetuous rushing of the blood into the lungs for the effect truly called hysterical is chiefly and primarily convulsive and depends principally on the brain and genus nervosum being affected and is produced by the explosion of the animal spirits as are other convulsive motions and whatever disorder or irregularities happen else about the motion of the blood they are only secondary and depend on the convulsions of the viscera nor is this disease only frequent but so strangely various that it resembles almost all the diseases poor mortals are inclined to and generally ends in an hemiplegy a palsy on one side below the head which obstructs the animal spirits in their passage and is exactly like an appoplexy whereby corpulent and old people are destroyed because the cortex of the brain is stopped by a super abundance of phlegm in the violent convulsions that happen in an hysterical cholick women seem to have the falling sickness and sometimes struggle so violently that though at other times their strength is but ordinary they can scarce be held by all the united strength of those that are about them  pathognomick symtoms the symptoms of this disease are various and manifold and seldom agree in diverse women or happen wholly in the same manner the most common are malignant vapors excessive stretching or tearing pain under the short ribs a motion in the lower part of the belly and an ascent as it were of some round thing there falsely imputed to the womb then a belching or straining to vomit a distention of the hypocondres and a rumbling with a belching forth of wind an uneven and for the most part short breath a suffocation in the throat a giddiness an inversion or rolling of the eyes often laughing or weeping or talking idly sometimes a speechlessness and immobility with an obscure or no pulse and a cadaverous countenance women of all ages and conditions are obnoxious to this disease rich and poor virgins wives widows and sometimes those symptoms appear in girls before puberty and sometimes in old woman after their menses are ceased and some learned physicians tells us that even men are sometimes troubled with such kind of passions but  though the hysterical cholick often rises from the brain yet sometimes it comes by a cause beginning either in the womb or in other parts or the viscera and in whatever part it seats it self it presently produces such symptoms as belong to it and unless the physician is very skilful he will be mistaken and think those symptoms come from some essential distemper of this or that part and not from an hysteric cholick therefore the symptoms are best taken from the part affected but among all the diagnostick signs of an hysterical cholick this is most proper and almost inseparable viz an urine as clear as rockwater which hysterical women evacuate most plentifully and is in almost all of them the pathognomick sign of this disease which we call hsterical in women and hypocondriacal in men and women and men seldom recover till the citron colored urine returns to its amber color  prognostic symptoms if the female patient is extraordinarily troubled with cholick griping pains and incessant vomitings joined with strong convulsive fits her menses stopped undergoing violent contractions and convulsions about the parts of the mouth and face and arms and legs with a pale wan countenance and trembling as she walks and growing every day worse than other her case is very dangerous and seldom or never admits of cure but if the convulsions cease by administering proper medicines adapted to cholick pains and fits of the mother in conjunction vapors ascending from the womb are expelled and the menses orderly flow they are hopeful indications  the procatartick or external causes of this complicated disease causes of an hysterical cholick are violent motions of the body or which is oftener and worse violent perturbations of the mind from some sudden assault either of anger or grief or such like passions especially as i have said already if urine clear as crystal evacuated copiousl at some certain times makes the diagnostick more manifest but to these disorders of the mind which are usually the cause of this disease emptiness of the stomach by reason of long fasting is to be added and immoderate bleeding a vomit or purge that has wrought too much now having drawn the picture of this disease according to its vulgar phenomena in the next place the internal efficient causes are to be considered as well as i can gather them from all the circumstances joined together and in my opinion this disease that i call an hsterical cholick proceeds from a stoppage of the menses a confusion of the animal spirits when too many of them and contrary to due proportion are violently burried upon this or that part causing convulsions and pains when they rush upon parts of exquisite sense to which the causes of a simple cholick being added you have the true causes of this disease  the general method for the cure of this disease is first to give present ease in the paroxisms and then proceed to a cure to accomplish both these intentions it is usual in the first place to apply stinking and strong smelling things to the nostrils the effluvias of which repress and reduce to order the spirits which are grown too wild and apt to make exorbitant efforts nay and discuss their heterogeneous combination and often wholly exterminate it assa faetida castoreum galbanum tied in a fine cloth and held to the nostrils are proper also partridges feathers or old shoes burnt or sulphur kindled also the spirit and oil of soot and hartshorn often give ease but the chief indication in this disease is to strengthen the blood which is the fountain of the spirits which being done the invigorated spirits can preserve that order which is agreeable to the economy of the whole body and the particular parts and therefore when the ataxy of the spirits has vitiated the humors by long continuance you must first lessen the humors so corrupted by bleeding and purging if the patient has sufficient strength before you endeavor to invigoate the blood and which indeed you can scarce do whilst a faeculent heap of humors lie in the way  if there be room for a vomit you must always begin with that especially in cacochmical persons in whom a mighty load of viscous phlegm sticking to the folds and coats of the stomach hinders the virtues of other medicines in a few days after the vomit unless somewhat indicates the contrary in women of a hot temperament open a vein in the arm presently or afterward if need be take blood from the foot or the fundament by leeches and after these evacuations duly performed always provided they be indicated let a purge be given three or four mornings after then to strengthen the blood and consequently support the spirits let chalybeates be exhibited to raise a volatile ferment in the vapid and languid blood that the spirits may be roused which before were pressed down by their own weight these directions i think sufficient without prescribing particular medicines or their doses for he that does not understand what medicines are proper in every disease the quantity to be given and the manner how and the time when is unfit to practice physic and for those who do not pretend to that skill they may have experimented medicines of me in most diseases if they either please to come themselves or send their cases in writing or by an intelligent messenger  for the hysterical cholick i have such excellent and effectual remedies the knowledge and use where of god and nature has freely bestowed on me and daily produce such wonderful effects by their own native goodness and efficacy that i should be wanting in my gratitude to god unjust to my self and injurious to the diseased part of mankind not to make them known to the inquisitive world since i dont pretend to a multiplicity of medicines or to more art than others of my own profession tho i take more care than some others of my my own profession do in preparing them and in possessing my self of such medicines as are fit not to palliate but to cure diseases speedily safely and thoroughly among which in the cure of this disease and vapors which attend it i have a particular secret that has been experienced to excel all others that i have either heard or read of in the whole republic of physic as i can prove by abundance of instances though i give here but a few  frances mash dwelling next house to the sign of the three travelers in kentstreet southwark being so violently afflicted with a hysteric cholick that it was thought it would have been her death upon taking my remedies which i freely gave her because she was but in mean circumstances she was perfectly recovered of her distemper and desired it might be published for the good of all people who suffer under the same disease  mrs poulter dwelling at mr jacksons a bricklayer in mercer sstreet next door to the sign of the angel in longacre in the parish of st martins in the fields being sore grieved with a cholick and vapors insomuch that her painful fits continued several nights together to that degree that he life was despaired of by all that visited her being thought past recovery but applyin her self to me and god giving a blesin to my medicines she was perfectly ced and continues in as good health as ever she enjoyed in her whole life though she has no taken any medicines for eight or te months last past  a gentlewoman of good reputation is for the public good ready and willing to attest the truth of two remarkable and etraordinary cures performed by taking m medicines one upon her father who w severely afflicted with the cholick arising from hypocondriack effects which is the same disease in men as hysterical are in women an the other on her daughter which was purely cholical the stone and hysterical whos cases were both thought very dangerous b some eminently learned physicians wh attempted their cure but without success who afterward following my directions i taking my remedies had the benefit of a absolute cure if any persons desire it  shall direct them to the gentlewomans habitation who will satisfy them of the trut of what is above asserted  mary wats dwelling in noblestreet nea goldsmithshall being seized with the ston and an hysteric cholick which kept her almos in continued pains at times for ten year together and was thought by her self and others incurable by giving her my medicines appropriated to that distemper she had relief and an absolute cure  and since experience shows that stoppage of the menses or suppression of the courses is one of the causes of a hysteric cholick i cannot here forbear to acquaint the world that i am possessed of a powder of a long curious and chargeable preparation which never fails to cure that distemper whether in women caused by the veins of the matrix being obstructed so that the superfluous blood which nature ordaind to be evacuated that way having not a free passage returns to the greater vessels and is circulated with be whole mass of blood and humors by which they are in time vitiated to the great prejudice of the womans health in being the original causes of several other diseases as well as the hysteric cholick or if these obstructions happen to virgins and then is called the green sickness the whitefever and the white jaundice because the native color in such persons is very pale yet a few grains of this powder taken according to my directions will infallibly cure all those diseases as all that try it will happily experience and for cleansing the womb and furthering conception in barren women there is not the like medicine i believe in the world  the scorbutic cholick colica scorbuticus or the scorbutic cholick there is a sort of cachexy reigning in our northern clymats whose symptoms chiefly appearing in the hypochondria is called the hypocondriack evil and when its symptoms are very fierce and exalted it is named the scurvy an apellation given it by the saxons in north germany who are generally afflicted with it it is a busy intermedling encroaching disease that now mingles almost with all chronical distempers and passes inconceivably into all parts of the body which caused helmant to say of complicated effects that per ignorata seminaria and initia invisibilia by unknown seminaries and in visible beginnings which is certainly true for in these latter times new diseases have started up which were unknown to the ancients because they have put on other strange symptoms and properties quibus larvati incedunt with which they walk disguised and deceive such physicians as think to cure diseases by following the directions and precepts of the ancients who knew little or nothing of the unaccountable mixtures complications and disguises which we daily see and yet some are so sottish to confine themselves to such superannuated exploded definitions notions and medicines as they have left us who practiced when diseases were but few more single calm and gentle and more tractable and curable than at this day when its rare to sind an uncomplicated disease in which the blood and other humors are not vitiated by being unhappily mixed with other unseen maladies  now because the scurvy is a lurking disease and consumes the patient by insensible or slow degrees and its direful effects are never so much perceived or felt as when it intermixes it self with other diseases so its seldom regarded as the principal offender but the the disease is chiefly attributed to the concommitant distemper that causes pain so it often happens that a continued latent scurvy is little observed but when its joined with the cholick that causes griping tormenting pains the disease is called a cholick and remedies used accordingly without success because the scurvy was neglected though scarce any effect requires a more speedy physical help than the cholick and gripes of the besly occasioned by the scurvy which makes them more violent and of longer continuance by obstinately resisting the methods of cure  in the symptoms of the scorbutic cholick symptoms of the scorbutic cholick i shall be very brief having been very large on that head in the foregoing cholicks  the usual signs are high colored urine or precipitating a red sandy flesh colored sediment or fastens red friable sand upon the sides of the urinal continual pain of the head palpitation of the heart puffing up of the stomach loathing vomiting belching hiccough cough tumors and putrefaction of the gums with much spitting looseness and blackness of the teeth for the cure of which i have a dentefrice which makes the teeth as white as ivory the breath stinks and is sometimes fetched with great difficulty and is seldom free from terrible pains of the cholick and trembling and looseness of the joints and limbs with laziness and often faint sweats there is also sometimes malignant ulcers dry hard tubercles erisipelas and oedematous tumors with many others which to enumerate were to comprehend an universal genus of atoms within a very narrow limitation  this disease is very hard to cure where the scorbutic humor is obdurate and predominant and when the cure has been too long delayed or not treated as a complicated disease many times it is very dangerous the pains of the cholick may run into an incurable iliack passion and its sullen companion may bring a dropsy a consumption or other mortal chronical distempers and sometimes acute diseases as the appoplexy swooning or the like which produce sudden death  causes of a scorbutic cholick the immediate causes of this disease is a volatile acid that irritates the nerves and membranes sharpens the lympha debauches the innate spirits of the parts and perverts the equal temperature of the blood the remote causes are sea air impregnated with salin acid vapors salt and viscous food laziness weakness of digestion infection a hereditary conveyance and the influence of chronical diseases if the disease is recent it admits of cure if inveterate it requires a continued use of proper medicines for a long space of time  cure of a scorbutic cholick the cure of a scorbutic cholick consists in correcting and evacuating the crudities of the first passages fortifying the stomach retrieving the due crasis of the blood restoring all wonted evacuations to their former course and to appease excruciating pains in order then to compass these ends and cure this stubborn and rebellious disease the sick must observe a good diet without which physical means will profit but little and here because in the first place there will be a necessity if possible to give ease in the fit by opiates let them always be accompanied by antiscorbutick specificks of which may be prepared diversity of good medicines both chemical and galenical the volatile salts both of animals and vegitables are excellent to open all obstructions and temper the humors also elixir proprietatis the spirit of sal armoniack the spirit of nitre and of salt dulcified salt of steel wormwood and tartar oil of juniper cloves and cinnamon are all antiscorbutick specificks  next in order are gentle laxitives especially in hot constitutions such are pills of armoniacum or those of tartar mixed with sweet mercury to prevent or take away costiveness resinous purgatives are to be avoided as beings endowed with an astringent quality raisins prunes tamarinds and ripe sweet apples or their expressed juice are of considerable efficacy in this case but sugar and other sweet things ought to be carefully avoided rhubarb or cream of tartar sharpened with powder of jalap are proper for such as are of a moist juicy constitution  the patients body being thus prepared you ought to proceed to alteratives such are steel and all fixed salts or whatever subdues an acid to which join aperient diuretics and bitter stomachical aromaticks or the spirituous volatile salts mynsichts arcanum duplicatum is of excellent use especially when the sick is troubled with flushings and sudden inflammations elixir proprietatis prepared with an acid and mixed with the spirit of scurvigrass and that of sal ammoniac is also proper the tincture of tartar mixed with the spirit of salarmoniack and given by degrees to forty drops is a celebrated medicine and as you find occasion fomentations ligatures ventoses sternutatories etc are of use  i have been long you see in discoursing the cure of the scorbutic cholick according to the general method of practice because its a stubborn disease and too often of long continuance occasioned by this disease being as it were an odd and new kind of distemper not reducible to the old class of cholicks secondly being not considered in its various mixtures complications and disguises which requires other sorts of medicines to cure it than are commonly prescribed thirdly by practioners being confounded by variety of medicines directed by authors who seeing one medicine fail run to another and so from medicine to medicine in an endless circuit till they have either destroyed or nauseated their patients as well as crammed their chamberwindows and tables with galipots glasses boxes and papers whose contents instead of expelling noxious humors had no other effect than draining the patients purse to enrich an unexperienced unskilful physician  now these evils almost grown a common nuisance to the public as well as a reproach to physicians are remedied by those few men of which number i profess my self to be one that make art follow nature rather than strain nature and her anomalies to general rules of art and who seeing nature degenerated into extravagancies and complicated diseases unknown to the ancients endeavor to find out experienced ways to deal with her however various and disguised and by red cing a whole apothecarys shop into a few well studied and often experienced medicines such men though falsely called empericks will be masters in the art of physic since they can truly say with ovid remed am l    et quoniam vaniant morbi variabimus arts mill mali species mill salutis erunt  because diseases mix and vary therefore we do vary arts of cure and though there be a thousand sorts of strange distempers steal on us we have most certain ways to heal this being the main and honest design of practicing it will be no strange thing to believe that i being bred an apothecary and having seen the ineffectual prescription and multiplicity of medicines used by other men and dedicating my life to the service of mankind in the knowledge and practice of physic that i should by conversation much reading of the best authors foreign and domestic and by almost a twenty years practice be able to shorten the number of medicines and contract them into a few but so efficacious in their nature and effects as render them effectual in most diseases and such i assure you i have for the cure of this contumacious disease the scorbutic cholick of which i could give you numerous examples of persons cured by them as well as in these few that follow who have given me leave to make use of their names and places of abode of which i see i must be more sparing for the future because the book begins to swell into a larger volume than i first intended  elizabeth the late wife of robert miles tobacconist in lamballey in abchurchlane was for some years troubled with a complication of diseases viz the scorbutic cholick rheumatism sciatica palsy gravil in the kidneys and very troublesome vapors living in so miserable a condition that she was left off by several practioners as incureable and thought to be even at the very brink of the grave but being committed to my gare through the blessing of god upon the use of my medicines i cured her of her complicated distempers to that degree that she comfortably attends her daily affairs and enjoys a better state of health that she had done for six years last past the truth whereof she is ready and willing to attest upon oath before a magistrate as she has done to me in a certificate under her hand  mr william bagley clothworker i miless alley in petticoatlane was afflicte with a rhuematism complicated with scorbutic cholick pains for four years successively at spring and fall a lameness in hi hands and feet with large knobs and swellings was cured by the use of my medicines and has continued in firm health without any symptoms of a relaps or the return of pain for a long space of time as h will satisfy any person that enquires  him  william west senior waterman dwellin near st saviors millstairs in southwar was violently afflicted with a scorbutic cholick joined with nephritick pains vulgarl called the stone cholick and receiving  help from others addressed himself to m and i at a small charge and in little tim cased him of his terrible griping pains ar brought away three large stones in gratitude for which cure he recommended several of his neighbors to me who were troubled with the like disease who all as well as himself were cured to their great satisfaction  the iliack passion i his disease called in greek  in latin iliaca passio from the gut ileon which is chiefly affected in this distemper is a cholick in excess an extreme costiveness pain about the navel rising from the inverted peristaltick motion of the guts disgorging the excrements upward for the fibers of the guts which ought to be contracted from e superior toward the inferior are drawn to the superior so whatsoever is contained in the guts is vomited up and clysters how sharp so ever become vomitive purges also taken by the mouth are cast up by vomit and i am of opinion that the exquisite and intolerable pain coming upon this disease is only occasioned by the aforesaid preposterous motions of the guts for as those folds which the many circumvolutions of the guts make are so formed by nature that they should most aptly conduce to the carrying down of the feces when they are forced to give way to a motion contrary to their fibers the aforesaid pain is occasioned from thence which is fixed to one part and is like the boaring of an augur when either the value which is seated at the beginning of the colon hinders the going back of the excrements to the ilium or any other membrane belonging to the sinus sustains alone the force of this peristaltick motion  symptoms of an iliack passion the signs of an approaching iliack passion are extreme costiveness retraction of the anus a loathing vomiting and intolerable pains in the small guts and if a hiccough follow it threatens death if the anus is much drawn back so that a clysterpipe cannot enter it it is a sign that the gross intestiness are affected if otherwise the small guts are touched if the greatest pain possesses the epigastrium the ilium is most oppressed a shooting burning pain in one particular part of the body a lipyria fever if the pain ceasing is attended by cold sweats difficult respiration swoonings and sometimes convulsions it is a sign of a gangrene caused by the corrugation of the guts mistaken by some for a twisting of em round one another a thing inconsistent with their ligation to the mesentery in fine the common symptoms of an iliack passion are hardness of the belly suppression of the urine loathing vomiting first the contents of the stomach and next the excrements a stinking habit of body frequent swoonings insufferable griping pains in the guts a prodigious anxiety and sometimes vomiting of clysters  prognostic signs in the prognostics of an iliack passion nflamations or gangreenes are mortal if the upper gut descend in the lower it is a fatal symptom if the lower ascend into the higher it is curable if the disease proceed from a rupture or hardened excrements it is not desperate if sleep succeeds the taking of opiates it is a hopeful indication deafness or dotings are pernicious consequences if the sweat breath and belching stink very much death is about to put an end to the patients misery  causes of the iliack passion the cause of an ileos or iliaca passio is a excrementitious viscous matter adhering to the gut ileo which in time is coagulated into a very hard substance almost in the form of bullets whence all the passage for excrements by siege is stopped and anon their regress and ascent to the stomach follows with a miserable vomiting of them up  the rupture of the peritoneum may cause this grievous disease especially if it be so great that not only the small guts but the great ones also fall through the lacerated orifice and renders them incapable of being reduced or put back through the same hole so that a hard and unsupportable tumor follows which hinders the reflux of blood and causes an inflammation and consequently a gangrene in the guts attended with a violent vomiting of the excrements and a speedy summons to the grave  but we may chiefly assign a twofold cause of this inversion from whence the pain arises and they are obstruction and irritation for whatever violently obstructs the intestines so that nothing can pass downwards necessarily occasions this contrary motion in them as hardened excrements gross wind collected in great quantity etc irritation proceeds from sharp and malignant humors cast upon the stomach and guts that are next to it by the excessive raging of the blood by reason of a late fever begun whereby the motion of the stomach is first inverted and violently forced to cast up what is contained in it at length the small guts that are joined to the stomach being weakened yield to the violent motion of it and with them at last the greater follow by consent the stomach vomiting beginning the fatal tragedy and this may be truly called the iliack passion  the cure of this disease consists in removing the irritation and retrieving the natural motion of the guts to that end if the excrements are hardened they ought to be softened by the speedy exhibition of clysters before they are hardened beyond relief all purgatives are improper till the pain in the guts and stomach are quieted and restored to their natural motion which you may know by a large quantity of humors being voided downwards by the help of nature or art opiates are very hurtful in case of a gangrene and in that of obstructions till the belly is well opened but if the disease proceed from violent irritations attended by continual vomiting opiates may be mixed with stomachical medicines while the patient is strong always remembering that whatever you use in the cure of this disease whether outwardly or inwardly must be warm both in the fit and when the patient is on the mending hand  if the small guts only are inverted give emollient clysters quickened with sal gem or the infusion of crocus metallorum or those of the carminative seeds boiled in childs urine and water but if the great ones are also inverted that sort of clysters are noxious and you must seek help from temperate laxative lubrical potions such as the decoction of emollient herbs in broth mixed with oil of sweet almonds newly drawn  when all other medicines want success some men give leaden bullets and boast of the use of quicksilver which i have seldom known to have done much good but often prove injurious especially in an inflammation rupture gangrene or falling of the upper gut into the lower therefore if any practitioner thinks himself under a necessity of using quicksilver which is prefered before bullets let him be sure to prepare his patients body before he gives it with lubric al medicines such as oil of sweet almonds new drawn or sperma caeti then exhibit three four and sometimes eight ounces of purified quicksilver together with oil of sweet almonds and mint water and if it does not answer his intentions at first let it be frequently repeated and the mean while inject emollient clysters foment the belly with softning decoctions or set the sick into a proper bath if the mercury does not force its way out of the body give sharp clysters and anoint the belly with oil of coloquintida to soften the excrements if the quicksilver offend the mouth throat and gums check its virulence with a gargarism of honey of roses and syrup of violets and if the mercury is successful in opening the body remember to exhibit the lunar bezoar and diaphoretick antimony to expel the remains of the mercury for though mercury given by an intelligent person is an excellent medicine yet it always does mischief if any of it stays too long in the body  these are the usual methods for discovering the cause and curing this disease which i publish in this succinct way first to assist those that want greater light secondly to show that i am thoroughly instructed in the knowledge of physic and thirdly to silence malicious backbiters who for want of business make it part of their employment to represent me in their ow class of ignoramuss which this treatise a the rest that are to follow it will plainly confute in the opinion of all men of sense generosity and learning  in my own practice for the cure of this disease when it evidently appears by the symptoms abovenamed and by vomiting up clysters that its a true iliack passion i apply my self to give the patient some ease if it be possible for let others say what they please he that can do that has half conquered the disease for then nature will assist in removing the cause by being enabled to sustain the force of medicines proper to soften the excrements and after to expel them by siege and to this end i give my elixir in small doses repeat them often and enlarge the number of drops every time they are given and i never found them unsuccessful their virtue being to invigorate the sick by giving him a relaxation from his pain mollifying the offending matter and by that means preparing and smoothing the way for my pills to drive it out by gentle degrees for this disease will endure no rough and violent treatment  here i cannot according to custom give examples of persons cured by the use of my two abovenamed remedies one i cured sometime since but am not permitted to make use of her name for though blessed be god i have never wanted success yet i could not prevail with the patients i have cured to give me leave to name them and so the credit of my medicines in this case can have no other vouchers but my own word and reputation which i value my self more upon than ten thousand testimonials  the caeliack cholick called in greek  in latin caeliaca passio the caeliack passion or caeliack cholick is a looseness of the belly when the meat comes forth crude and imperfectly digested which some say is not to be refered to the concoction only being hurt but to the debility of the retentive faculty the food being not long enough retained to be concocted by which it appears say they that the disease proceeds from a fault in the stomach as well as in the guts but the learned etmullerus says it is a flux of the belly by which the chyle is voided together with excrements the stomach being in no fault because chylification is duly performed there therefore the blame says he must either be laid on the bile that is stopped in its passage to the guts or by degenerating from its saline acrimony and consequently is unfit to separate the chyle or else on the lacteal vessels through which the chyle ought to pass their orifices being covered with slime or shut by the contraction or corrosion of the intestines occasioned by fluxes  symptoms of a caeliaca the symptoms of this disease are extraorinary pains both in the upper and lower region of the belly not unattended with pain in the back and limbs for all complicated diseases generally affect all the neighboring parts as well as the place where they are more particularly and chiefly seated and that you may have a true notion of this maladay observe that if the bile is defective the excrements are white or very pale without any sign of separation if the obstruction of the lacteal veins cause the disease the excrements are yellowish and the chyle though voided at the same time with them is but loosely mixed with them as being separated in the guts but disappointed in its passage  causes of a coaliack cholick the causes of this distemper are generally ranked under three heads which will comprehend all the differing opinions about it the first is a cold distemper of the stomach and liver which generate phlegmatic and glutinous humors which cover the wrincles of the stomach that it cannot retain the food though retention be made by the astringing quality yet it operates by fit instruments viz the rawness of the inward coat of the stomach which rawness being taken away and the wrincles filled by the humors aforesaid the retention is damnified and the food slips away without concoction  the second cause assigned by others is violent sharp humors that prick twinge and irritate the parts by which the stomach and guts are provoked to send out the meat too soon  the third and which i take to be the true cause of the caeliack cholick is the obstruction of the mesenteraick veins which hinder the passage of the chyle to the liver or the obstruction of the glandules of the mesentery and therefore must of necessity be ejected by the belly if this disease is of long continuance it is very dangerous because nature is deprived of her nourishment and the weak body is liable to the insults of all diseases  now since the disease called  a lientary is also a flux of the belly in which the food is quickly thrown out of the body undigested and differs only from a caeliack cholick in degrees and that their cures are the same i shall omit treating particularly on that head and refer the reader to what follows  cure of the caelick cholick the curatory indication of the caeliack choliack is to remove the morbisick cause and strengthen the stomach which kind of method being seasonably begun and duly prosecuted often does the whole work for the cause of the disease or the root of it being cut off the effects depending on it die of their own accord therefore if the bile is sluggish or stopped in its passage means must be used to make it more active to correct the acid and austure ferment proceeding from the stomach and intestines to retrieve the natual texture and distribution of the bile and to promote the separation of the heterogenious particles if the lacteal or milky vessels are shut up endeavor to remove the slime that choaks them by attenuating opening ingredients astringents are improper let the peccant humors be purged after which the tincture of tartar or of the dross of regules of antimony or chalybeate tinctures mixed with the spirit of sal armoniaci are very convenient to strengthen the stomach by procuring an appetite amatus lusitanus highly commends the following prescription conserve of roses six ounces venice treacle six drams and syrup of quinces a sufficient quantity to make an opiate halt an ounce of which must be taken in the morning fasting an hour after it  for the use and benefit of my own patients i have stated and well experienced medicines for the cure of this disease  which i could give numerous examples though i only prodnce two  experience guides my practice others may do what their inclinations prompt them to mrs anne percival of russel street bloomsbury was for several years grieved with a caeliack cholick at certain times and seasons only but about three months since she was seized with it in so violent and terrible a manner that her life was despaired of and having by the advice of some able physicians taken diverse medicines without receiving any benefit by them at length hearing of my great success in curing the cholick of what kind soever she came to me who through the divine blessing and the use of my medicines was cured in a short time and that others who suffer the like cruel pains and languish under that disease might also find relief gave me authority under her hand writing to publish her name and cure and if any person desires further satisfaction in this matter if they please to enquire at her brothers house mr percival in benbridgestreet in the parish of st giless in the fields this fact will be attested by word of mouth  samuel maynard dwelling in lydes court near st giless church being sorely afflicted with the cholick and rheumatism the sciatica and excessive pains in his back and limbs insomuch that he was incapable of following his employment was happily cured by my advice and taking my remedies in a very short time and now is able to follow his business as formerly this example i insert as i could do many others to show what a concatenation of diseases and different sorts of pains and in many places do often accompany this disease as will further appear in the next instance  a sufficient and reputable tradesmans wise in the city of london was unspeakably troubled with vapors originally proceeding from this disease which run her into distraction and after much advice and taking many medicines from other physicians to no purpose her husband sent for me and by heaven s blessing my particular care and the seasonable use of my medicines she was restored to her senses perfectly recovered freed from her vapors and so continues so that you see violent pains of the head giddiness and frenzies are concomitants in a caeliack cholick i will direct any modest enquirer how and where they may be satisfied of the truth of this remarkable instance from the gentlewomans own mouth  the choleric cholick this disease named in greek  and in latin cholerica passio is a grier in which the vicious humors are impetuously thrown out both by vomit and stool with a violent pain in the stomach and belly distension of the hypocondria heartburnings thirst perplexity of the breast a swift and sometimes small pulse frequent swoonings a coldness in the outward parts prostration of strength and at last convulsions and hiccoughs this disease some say is a symptom of the expulsive faculty being hurt by uncocted meats and if the retentive faculty is also in fault the distemper is so much the worse and more violent  immediate causes of a choleric cholick some make two sorts of this disease a wet and a dry and from hence came the vulgar distinction of moist and dry gripes a moist is what i am discoursing the dry is more rarely found proceeds from a windy spirit produced in the stomach by the fiery heat of the part corrupting the meat or by meats rank and windy as hipocrates himself affirms senuertus from the hermetical doctrine adds another cause namely salt and adust humors in the hpochondria which grow hot by the mixture of another humor and demonstrates it by the mixing aqua fortis and oil of vitriol with salt of tartar which produce very flatuous spirits so that according to these authors the immediate causes of this disease are choleric burnt sharp salt or rotten humors of the stomach bowels spleen and mesentery or some nourishment of a pernicious quality or some strong medicine or poison taken uncorrected  oasional causes the occasional causes of a choleric cholick are the same with those of a looseness the corruption and acrimony of food in the stomach the assumption of sharp costick medicines such as antimony arsenick mercury etc  if the excrements are livid faetid black or corrosive if it accompany malignant fevers especially in the beginning and if the stomach is much disordered it generally proves fatal it is an acute disease and quickly finishes its course it observes a tertian period in its exasperations and frequently relapses after an apparent cure  symptoms the signs preceding this disease are frequent and plentiful evacuations of choleric sharp and corrupted humors upward and downward swelling with wind thirst and gnawing pains in the stomach and guts a loathing which a little appeased with cold drink which is soon after cast up the pulse high and unequal sweating with convulsion of the extreme parts and swooning are dangerous symptoms it is easily discovered whether the disease came by some violent medicine poison or offensive diet  the internal causes are known by the quality of the humors that are ejected if there be continual loathing and gnawing the disease is in the stomach if a malignant fever is joined it is in the veins if it has its original from some ill diet there is hopes that when the peccant matter is cast out the disease will end if its very violent it is dangerous for the greater the convulsions swoonings and coldness of the extreme parts are the nearer death is at hand  in the beginning of the cure you ought to assist evacuations with gentle cooling and cleansing clysters especially milk clysters with venice treacle or diascordium dissolved in them are always useful it is proper to breathe a vein to cool the burnt and boiled blood but let it be done with discretion twice or thrice if the strength be not impaired by the first endeavor to qualify the sharpness of the humors after this manner waters of plantane purslane and mint of each two ounces syrup of quinces and dried roses of each one ounce syrup of vinegary half an ounce mix them and dissolve therein two scruples of theriack andromachi and six drops of oil of vitriol give now and then a spoonful but if the patient has some ease and if the symptoms abate or disappear take great care that they dont suddenly return to your amazement and the destruction of the patient as it sometimes happens unforeseen in this case therefore nourish him and strengthen his stomach says most of our eminent physicians with a restoring opiate compounded in or after this method gelly of hartshorn made with canary wine four ounces conserve of roses burrage bugloss and clove gillyflowers of each one ounce confectio alkermes half an ounce citron bark and nutmegs candied of each three drams essence of cloves mace nutmegs and cinnamon of each three drops and with the syrup of clove gillyflowers make on opiate of which must be taken the quantity of a hazle nut or more mornings and evenings of all the medicines used against looseness says a great author opium is the chief being a powerful controler of all tumultuous motions and accordingly prescribes laudanum opiatum or liquid laudanum in large quanties for the cure of this and most other diseases  but for my part though i will not pretend to censure the practice of my superiors yet i think my self obliged to say that i tamper not with opiates nor ever use laudanum but on extraordinary occasions being rather a pallative than a curative medicine and therefore in my practice for the cure of this or any other disease i pretend to cure i only employ my own experiencd medicines which by their own native virtue subdue diseases by their amicable correspondence with nature and by assisting her in all her operations and endeavors to support her self and exterminate those noxious invaders that disturb her desired peace and tranquillity and that i have such efficacious remedies for the cure of this disease if timely consulted will appear by the following examples  an eminent trader in the city of london who had for a long time been grieviously troubled with intolerable pains proceeding from a choleric cholick such as violent pains in the stomach and bowels distension of the hypochondria heart burning thirst and perplexity of the breast insomuch that he scarce enjoyed one minutes health and having advised with the learned and taken a multiplicity o medicines both inwardly and by outward applications to his breast to his very great trouble but without relief he was at last recommended to me and i perfectly cured him in a few days no symptoms of the said disease having appeard since the time of his recovery and though he is unwilling to have his name exposed in print yet to do me and my remedies justice and that others might reap benefit by the same means he has orderd me to send any person to receive satisfaction from his own relation which i am always ready to do  mr john shadwel near the sign of the three mariners in the parish of st thomas wapping mate of a merchant man having been a long voyage and feeding much upon meat that had been long salted at his coming on shore was violently taken with frequent vomiting and purging attended with great weakness of body a chilness in the outward parts and unexpressible pain he consulted two physicians took the medicines they jointly prescribed but those gentlemen being frighted at the appearance of a slight convulsive motion in the patients face and eyes gave him over as incurable whereupon i was sent for and by the blessing of god upon one single medicine he had ease in less than ten minutes time and continuing the same medicine but four days together was perfectly recovered and so remains to this day  the dysentery or bloody flux a dysentery which the greeks name  properly so called proceeds from the ulceration of the intestines but is commonly taken for every bloody flux the latins call it tormina from the excessive pain the patient endures this disease which is voiding blood and purulent matter with tormenting pain is distinguishd from the painless evacuation of thin watery blood from the internal hemerroid veinsm called by the ancients a flux of the liver and likewise from the natural discharge of blood independent of the guts causd by its redundancy in the body as after amputation suppression of the menses etc or by its acrimony opening the vessels or the obstruction of the bowels hindering its regular circulation agreeable hereunto galen mentions four kind of fluxes all which he calls dysenteries the first is when any usual evacuation of blood as the hemerroids or at the nostrils is impeded secondly when watery blood is voided occasioned by the weakness of the liver the third is blood mixed with melancholy and burnt by reason of its being detaind in the liver and spleen is evacuated and shines the fourth and last and that i am now treating of is when blood and excrements are mixed together and sometimes also purulent matter accompanies it to the patients intolerable pain  symptoms of a dysentery the diagnostick signs of the bloody flux are that the sick person is seized with unsufferable griping pains in the guts followed by frequent stools first of whitish matter and afterward of blood and slime mixed together watching thirsting loathing food and sometimes attended by a malignant fever and all its dismal symptoms if the small guts are affected the pain is vehement like the pricking of pins because they are of exquisite sense the patient goes not to stool presently after the pain and when he does is grievously tortured and the guts and bowels seem to fall down if the great guts are affected the pain is not so sharp and being seated toward the sides of the belly is quickly followed by stools the blood swims on the top or is a little mixd with the excrements and you may judge of the humor causing this disease by the color of the excrements age and temperament of the patient and the season of the year  there are three degrees observable in a dysemery the symptoms of the first are bloody and slimy stools in the second the slime is a sign of excoriation and in the third of an exulceration when the guts are excoriated it is either the crust that covers them or part of their thick tunicle or at most the caruncles or inflamed glandules of the guts that is voided  prognostic symptoms a dysentery caused by black choler is a dangerous sign if it be not critical because the ulcer grows cancerous be sure therefore you make a right judgment between melancholy and congealed blood if loathing of meat and a fever accompany it it is dangerous if pieces of flesh be voided in it it is deadly much watching great thirst black bloody and stinking stool without a mixture of humors hiccough choleric vomitings pains in the liver and midriff are generally deadly signs if choler and sharp diet is the cause of this disease its easily cured salt phlegm is worse because sticks longer in the guts if the because it sticks longer in the guts if the bloody flux happens to one troubled with a diseased spleen or the gout its good in the opinion of hippocrates because the matter is sent forth but i rather take this for a diarrhea than a dysentery  causes of the bloody flux the internal causes of this disease are sharp and vlcerating humors yellow green and black choler salt phlegm in the head created by heat or in the belly by putrefaction which being brought to the guts and sticking close to them ulcerates the part the sharp acid that irritates the guts provokes them to contraction assembles the blood by virtue of its provocation and corrodes the orifices of the blood vessels this may proceed from the corrupted matter in the guts but the cause of a malignant epidemical contagious looseness such as the learned sydenham discourses of as happening in the years       0       is a corrupt volatile acid not lodged in the guts but immediately reigning in the blood perverting its texture opening the vessels inserted into the guts and provoking them to convulsive contractions from whence is derived a malignant fever griping and bloody stools so though the previous excoriations may take place in benign dysenteries there is no occasion for them in the contagious malignant sort it being a sufficient cause of bloody stools that the costick ferment is a mortal enemy to the intestines like arsenick that perpetually thwarts and provokes them to convulsions upon which says that excellent author they squeeze out their blood together with their nutritious juice that they are not then in a capacity to receive and which is taken by some for the mucus or snot of the guts whereas the large quantities that are voided sufficiently evince the contrary  the external causes are all such things as procreate sharp and ill humors as meats which soon putrify ill the stomach fruits which are soon rotten and all things unripe the air thus qualified the winter cod and dry and the spring very wet and full of south winds cause dysenteries in summer or if the winter be wet and full of south winds and a dry spring and the north winds blow much such a season generally speaking produces bloody fluxes sometimes the air is infected and produces a contagious and epidemical dysentery which is so infectious that the excrements of the sick being cast into a boghouse infect all that sit over it to which may be added the taking of mercury coloquintida antimony lead the course powder of an adamant worms etc which vellicate the guts and heap up sharp humors in them  to cure of the bloody flux from what has been already said you may rationally infer that indications for cure of a dysentery are to evacuate sharp humors assuage pain cleanse consolidate and dry the ulcers purify the blood separate the preternatural ferment and stop the flux  to discharge the body of sharp humors you must purge every second third or fourth day according to the patients age and strength and the season of the year rhubarb given in powder a dram a dram and half and two drams is very usual but because pouders are apt to stick to the guts and vex them i better approve of it converted into a potion made of liquoras raisms of the sun tamarinds and yellow myrabolans boiled in barleywater to three or four ounces which liquor being strained infuse in it a dram of rhubarb sliced very thin then add an ounce of syrup of roses solutive and you have a very good medicine to evacuate sharp humors  if the dysentery is accompanied with a fever and inflammation of the bowels open a vein let the patient bleed in proportion to his strength sometimes vomiting is profitable to repel the humors which fall from the stomach to the intestines and therefore not to be omitted especially if the patient is inclined to vomit for then nature dictates the right way and ought to be immitated in disburdening a foul stomach afterward you ought to give asswaging mild and cleansing clysters and succeed them with astringent clysters  if the vlcerss stand in need of cleansing add centaury and wormwood to the former decoction and to the strained liquor add turpentine dissolvd in the yolk of an egg and the chemical oil of wax of each one dram when there is more need of binding and glutinating medicines give emplastick clysters to cover the internal superfices of the guts and preserve those parts from the gnawing of the matter  to cleanse give goats milk to glutinate cows milk chalybeated which is proper to consolidate and heal to which you may add the juice of plantan syrup of comfrey sugar of roses troches of amber and rhasiss white troches let the sick eat rice boiled in chalybiated milk or the mucilage of gum tragacanth and arabic drawn with rose or plantan water the quantity of half a dram in his broth to purify the blood and separate the preternatural ferment goddards drops are often successful and to complete the cure the body being thoroughly cleansed you may use astringent decoctions and narcoticks to stop the flux  and if this course and these medicines are ineffectual as sometimes to the patients disappointment and extravagant charge they have been too often found let the sick try my medicines which have never yet failed to cure the bloody flux in numerous instances of which i only give you two examples  mr alexander carter tailor dwelling in swanyard over against somerset house in the strand was sorrowfully afflicted with the bloody flux above two years together without any intermission insomuch that he had almost ruined himself in going from one doctor to another and yet was still rather worse than any thing better till he came to me and made use of my remedies which cured him in a few days and now continues in as good health as ever he enjoyed in his life to the truth whereof he is ready to make oath if desired  mr thomas chiffinch carpenter aged sixty odd years was seven years grieved with the bloody flux at certain times but the last three years had it constantly and in so violent a manner as threatened him with inevitable death in the opinion of all his friends and acquaintance for he could find no relief in all the means he used but applying himself to me and taking my medicines was cured in a short time and at a small charge the truth of which immediate cure will be attested to any person that pleases to enquire either of mr clark or the patient himself at duglass coffee house in st martins lane westminster  having now i presume said enough about the cure of the cholick in all its different kinds and the other diseases that generally accompany it sufficient for the instruction of the industrious and ingenious and too much for the envious idle and ignorant i should have concluded this treatise but because i resolve to publish several other discourses on other diseases and that many people who have met with repeated disappointments in following other mens remedies before my books now under hand can be published for their sakes as well as my own i shall briefly show in a few examples in what other diseases as well as the cholick my medicines have been wonderfully successful and also that the over curious or suspicious may receive entire satisfaction by enquiring of the persons i have taken leave to name and the places where they dwell in the following brief catalogue which i shall begin with the headache  headache and vertigo william fletcher of engfield in the country of middlesex whitesmith being grievously afflicted with the megrim giddiness and swimming pains in the head so that oftentimes he was in danger of falling down as he worked or walked which continued upon him for the long space of six years and using diverse medicines for his cure but without success he applied to me and i in letting him blood in the inside of one of his nostrils and giving him a medicine he found immediate relief without any pain or trouble for above a year but afterward finding a pain and giddiness on the other side of his head and i letting him blood in the nostril of that side he was perfectly cured of that vexatious and troublesome disease  head ach mr samual haines broadsilkweaver dwelling in fashonstreet in spittlefields london was for the long space of twelve or thirteen years violently afflicted with the headache and though he industriously sought relief from other hands could find none till he made use of my remedies and by them the almightys blessing interposing was thoroughly cured  edward harrison leather dresser living with sir isaac shard knight in horselyedown near southwark was sorely afflicted with the headache at certain times which returned very often and continued to his great chief in this manner six whole years successively of which he could find no cure though he used variety of medicines from no mean professors of physic but at last applying himself to me was perfectly cured  margaret thomas servant to the late mrs jux who was her majestys strower and did then dwell in little scotlandyard adjoining to white hall was grievously troubled with the headache for the space of two years and with other female distempers much longer with which she will acquaint any of her own sex that thinkfit to enquire of her but after the use of not a few medicines prescribed by other practitioners in physic without effect she was recovered from all her diseases by following my advice and the use of my medicines and continues in perfect health to the present time  william watson late servant to mr welsh vertigo a shoemaker in chancery lane london was much troubled with a vertigo or giddiness of the head between five and six years and sometimes so violently that some thought it would terminate in a appoplexy or epilepsy of which disease he could find no cure till he applied himself to me and by gods blessing and giving him experienced proper remedies he was restored to health  moses grant late servant to mr london perrukemaker in channel row westminster was fourteen years troubled with the headache and four years last past was afflicted with it in so grievous a manner and with such intolerable pain without one days intermission and making use of diverse medicines without relief he came to me and i effectually cured him by giving him my medicines in six or eight times and he has continued well for a year last past as he assures me excepting twice that he was slightly visited with it by too hard drinking which soon went off again without the use of any means  a child of mr john evanss frameworkknitter in handalley in bishopsgatestreet was so grievously afflicted with soreeyes occasioned by a defluction of hot rheum on those tender parts which continuing with great severity above a quarter of a year twas the general opinion she would be blind but her father addressing himself to me i perfectly cured his childs sore eyes and took away the cause in three or four days time and left her as well as ever she was in her life  the worms mr robert guinn at the sign of the two brewers in white lion yard near nortonfalgate in the parish of stepney for some years past was so abundantly pestered with worms that sometimes they dropped out of his body as he went along the streets and at other times crept from him when he was in bed he was also afflicted with an excessive ravenous appetite and yet though he eat as much as would have sufficed six or eight persons he received no nourishment by his food but fell away and was so wasted in his flesh that he was little else than skin and bones he had long sought relief from many and variety of means but all in vain till he came to me and through mercy i cured him of all these complicated and uncommon distempers in about a fortnights time and has continued in a good state of health ever since  the son of mr john carter in georgealley in colemanstreet london who was about two years of age and terribly afflicted with worms and gnawing griping pains by taking my remedies voided above a pint of worms was freed from his pains and has continued well ever since  i could give you may other instances of persons of both sexes young and old but i reserve them for a particular treatise of the worms that will immediately follow the publication of this book  rheumatism and gout a gentleman of considerable quality lame with a rheumatism and the gout to such a degree that he dreaded the utter loss of the use of his limbs but applying himself to me i cured him of his rheumatism eased his arthritick pains and so restored the use of his limbs that he is capable of attending his own affairs and though he will not allow his name to be printed yet i have his leave to send any person to him who will confirm the truth of what is here but privately divulged to name more persons whom i have cured of the rheumatism is wholly needless since the weekly papers have from time to time published to many and though i dont pretend to mke a perfect cure of the gout yet i hope i may be allowed to speak truth and say that my medicines never fail to give speedy ease in the most violent pains attending that disease  the stone and gravel mr william cordwell frameworkknitter at the sign of the blackboy in wheelers street spittlefields being violently afflicted with suppression of urine occasioned by the stone gravel and a concommitant cholick which had continued at certain times for three years last past and since christmas last in a more severe manner than ever applied himself to me and by the use of my remedies aforenamed voided several stones and obtained a perfect cure and having paid me for my medicines to my own content desired also that his cure might be published that others laboring under the same distemper might receive benefit by the same hand and means  franciswilks fevers dwelling near the sign of the blackhorse in blackmanstreet hard by st georgeschurch in southwark was seize five months with a tertian ague and having taken great quantities of jesuits powder or peruvian bark and an incredible number of other medicines to no purpose insomuch that he seemed to be on the brink of the grave and his circumstances being but indifferent i offered him his cure gratis which i performed with great expedition and so effectually that after the first dose of physic i gave him his fit returned no more and the patient enjoys his health to this day  the great number of patients i have cured of fevers under all denominations whether attended or unaccompanied with a cold shaking fit which are vulgarly called agues will excuse me from giving more examples in this disease because my medicines are so well known to give relief in fevers that to commend them by testimonies in uncessary waste of time since they recommend themselves by their innate virtue not because they are hot not because they are cold not because they cut and attenuate but because they have the peculiar virtue to extinguish the hot fermenting alkali which is the occasional internal and continent cause of fevers and that they may effect what they are designed for i vary them as i find occasion because vix ulla perpetua ars medicinalis recepit scarce any of the precepts of the art of physic are perpetual  coughs and consumptions mr thomas adin weaver dwelling in kings headyard in shoreditch was long afflicted with a consumptive cough attended with all the dismal symptoms of approaching death but by the blessing of god the medicines i directed him to take perfectly recovered him  spitting blood mary wife of mr richard darling barber formerly dwelt in burchenlane near lumbard street london was in three years time last past twice cured by medicines of a violent cholick and spitting blood and the last spring was seized with a hectic fever and all the dreadful symptoms of an approaching tabes or consumption and was given over for a dying woman by all her friends and relations but by heaven blessing the medicines she took of me she was restored to her former health as will be attested by more than twenty eyewitnesses of her unexpected cure as well as by the patient her self  the french disease in the next place i could give many examples of persons i have cured of both sexes of gonorheas and the french pox but because to give examples in such cases would be a horrid breach of good manners i shall only recommend my medicines as safe and certain in the cure and my self for perfect silence  the stone the last disease of which i shall give any examples in this book is the stone and shall begin in the well known case of mr richard hurford at the sign of the new england arms near ratliffcross who was twelve years afflicted with the stone but lately in a most violent manner and having taken abundance of medicines in hopes of ease but all in vain i gave him my own medicines experimentally adapted to the cure of that disease in his case which brought away an incredible number of stones and some of them as large as were capable of passing through the vreters and can scarce be credited by any but those that have seen and handled them  mary the wife of mr richard pomfret dwelling in little carter lane near the swan ale house was afflicted with the stone and gravel to that degree that upon any agitation of the body she made bloody urine and after she had had the advice of several doctors of physic but without success the first remedy i gave her put a stop to her bloody urine and brought away a prodigious quantity of gravel by which means she was cured at a small charge and in a very short time  having thus plainly proved to the meanest capacity the efficacy of my remedies the sincerity of my practice and the truth of the examples of persons cured insomuch that they that are not blinded by partiality or biased by interest must be masters of a great deal of sophistry that will pretend to deny contradict or oppose them i should now put an end to this brief discourse  but having a little paper to spare i shall employ it in accommodating the reader with the virtues and use of a bitter medicament which i invented and call tinctura stomachicalis major or the greater stomachical tincture  which is a composition of all the noblest bitter aromatic and stomachical specificks in the whole materia medica and perfectly answers all intentions accordingly it enlivens and sharpens a languid appetite expels viscous humors assists fermentation and helps digestion fortifies the stomach and prevents nauseating and loathing it is carminative a great expeller of wind out of the stomach and bowels and as all bitter things are medicinal against worms so this tincture has an excellent faculty that way if any person has the misfortune to drink bad wine or to drink to excess if he mingles some drops of this tincture in his wine it will rectify all disorders occasioned by hard drinking and prevent next mornings headachs loathsome vomitings and menacing surfeits the usual attendants on nocturnal debauches it is a good remedy for persons newly delivered from a fever or any chronical distemper because it strengthens the crasis or convenient mixture of qualities it is proper for mariners to carry with them to sea and for those that travel by land because it prevents ill accidents occasioned by ill or scanty diet change of air and epidemical infections it far excels all other bitter medicaments it never offends the eyes or causes breakings out on the skin as generally all other bitters do it will keep good many years and may be taken in wine ale tea or spring water from thirty drops to a hundred in the morning and at four or five of the clock in the afternoon when people find occasion for it either to cure diseases prevent them or confirm one in a state of good health in which i have found my tincture successful in many years practice being as pleasant a bitter as art can contrive one ounce of mine will make three ounces of any other bitter that is commonly exposed to sale and that the poor may receive benefit by it i will sell it to such as really are so for two shillings the ounce and twelve pence the half ounce  t u of the cpta sn for the cure of the headache deafness vertigo or giddiness and the cure of an old and inveterate cough i have also a caephalik snush which snuffed up both nostrils night and morning till the nose runs plentifully will produce the desired effect but when this and other remedies fail as the best sometimes do i have another way of curing the headache and vertigo by phlebotomy in the part and by a safe method scarce known or practiced by any other person  finis errata besides mispellings mispointings and literal faults the reader is desired in page    line   to read diseases act against us per ignorata seminaria etc
