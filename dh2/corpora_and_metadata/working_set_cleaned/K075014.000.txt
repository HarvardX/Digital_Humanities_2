of it  non sibi sed toti to which is added an answer to a supposed physicians letter to the right reverend the bishop of cloyne occasioned by his lordships treatise on the virtues of tarwater  dublin printed london reprinted for m cooper at the globe in paternoster row mdccxliv price sixpence  a letter to t p esquire from the author of siris i among the great numbers who drink tar water in dublin your letter informs me there are several that make or use it in an undue manner to obviate those inconveniences and render this water as generally useful as possible you desire i would draw up some rules and remarks in a small compass which accordingly i here send you  ii put a gallon of cold water to a quart of tar stir and work them strongly together for about four minutes let the vessel stand close covered for eight and forty hours that the tar may subside then pour off the clear water and keep it in bottles well corked for use this is a good general rule but as stomachs and constitutions are so various it may admit of some latitude the less water or more stirring makes it stronger as more water or less stirring makes it weaker  iii the same tar will not do so well a second time but may serve for common uses the putting off tar that has been used for fresh tar would be a bad fraud to prevent which it is to be noted that tar already used is of a lighter brown than other tar the only tar that i have used is that from our northern colonies in america and that from norway the latter being thinner mixeth easier with water and seems to have more spirit if the former be made use of as i have sometimes known it with good success the tar water will require longer stirring to make it  iv tar water when right is not paler than french nor deeper colored than spanish white wine and full as clear if there be not a spirit very sensibly perceived in drinking you may conclude the tar water is not good if you would have it good you must see it made yourself those who begin with it little and weak may by habit come to drink more and stronger according to the season or the humor of the patient it may be drank either cold or warm it lays under no restraint as to air exercise clothes or diet and may be taken at all times in the year  v as to the quantity in common chronical indispositions one pint of tar water a day may suffice taken on an empty stomach at two or four times to wit night and morning and about two hours after dinner and breakfast more may be taken by strong stomachs alteratives in general taken in small doses and often mix best with the blood how often or how strong each stomach can bear experience will show but those who labor under great and inveterate maladies must drink a greater quantity at least one quart per diem taken at four six or eight glasses as best suits the circumstances and case of the drinker all of this class must have much patience and perseverance in the use of this as well as of all other medicines which if sure and safe must yet from the nature of things be slow in the cute of inveterate chronical disorders in acute cases fevers of all kinds it must be drank in bed warm and in great quantity the fever still enabling the patient to drink perhaps a pint every hour which i have known to work surprising cures  vi as the mornings draught is most difficult to nice stomachs such may lessen or even omit it at the beginning or rather postpone it till after breakfast and take a larger dose at night the distance from mealtime need not be more than one hour when the stomach is strong or the glasses small the oil that swims on the top may either be drank with the rest of the liquor or skimmed off and kept for outward sores whether there be any difference between old tar or new tar or which of all the various tars produced from different trees or in different parts of the world is most medicinal future trials must determine  i have made a second sort of tar water to be used externally as a wash for the itch scabs ulcers leprosy and all such foul cases which i have tried with success and recommend it to the trial of others for inveterate cases of that kind tar water should be drank a quart every day at fix or eight glasses and at the same time the wash applied outwardly and warm by bathing fomenting and steeping to heal and dry up the sores and this several times in the twentyfour hours this water for external use must be made in the following manner pour two quarts of hot boiling water on a quart of tar stir and work it strongly with a flat stick or ladle for a full quarter of an hour let it stand eight hours then pour it off and keep it close covered for use it may be made weaker or stronger as there is occasion  vii my experiments have been made in various cases and on many persons and i make no doubt its virtues will soon be more fully discovered as tarwater is now growing into general use though not without that opposition which usually attends upon novelty the great objection i find made to this medicine is that it promises too much what say the objectors do you pretend to a panacea a thing strange chimerical and contrary to the opinion and experience of all mankind now to speak out and give this objection or question a direct answer i freely own that i suspect tarwater is a panacea i may be mistaken but it is worth trial for the chance of so great and general a benefit i am willing to stand the ridicule of proposing it and as the old philosopher cried aloud from the housetop to his fellow citizens educate your children so i confess if i had a situation high enough and a voice loud enough i would cry out to all the valetudinarians upon earth drink tar water  viii having thus frankly owned the charge i must explain to you that by a panacea is not meant a medicine which cures all individuals this consists not with mortality but a medicine that cures or relieves all the different species of distempers and if god has given us so great a blessing and made a medicine so cheap and plentiful as tar to be withal so universal in its effects to ease the miseries of human life shall men be ridiculed or bantered out of its use especially when they run no risque in the trial  ix it must be owned i have not had opportunities of trying it myself in all cases neither will i undertake to demonstrate a priori that tar water is a panacea but yet methinks i am not quitedestitute of probable reasons which joined to what facts i have observed induced me to entertain such a suspicion  x i know tar was used to preserve cattle from contagion and this may be supposed to have given rise to that practice of drinking tar water for a preservative against the smallpox but as the tar water used for that purpose was made by mixing equal quantities of tar and water it proved a most offensive portion besides as a fresh glass of water was put in for each glass that was taken our and this for many days on the same tar it followed that the water was not equally impregnated with the fine volatile spirit though all alike strongly saturated with gross particles  xi having found this nauseous draught very useful against the small pox to as many as could be prevailed on to take it i began to consider the nature of tar i reflected that tar is a balsam flowing from the trunks of aged evergeens that it resists putrefaction that it has the virtues of turpentine which in medicine are known to be very great and manifold but i observed withal that turpentines or balsams are very offensive in the taking i therefore considered distinctly the several constituent parts of balsams which were those wherein the medicinal virtues resided and which were to be regarded rather as a viscous matrix to receive arrest and retain the more volatile and active particles and if these last could be so separated and disengaged from the grosser parts as to impregnate a clear and potable liquor i concluded that such liquor must prove a medicine of great force and general use i considered that nature was the best chemist and preparer of medicines and that the fragrance and flavor of tar argued very active qualities and virtues  xii i had of a long time entertained an opinion agreeable to the sentiments of many ancient philosophers that fire may be regarded as the animal spirit of this visible world and it seemed to me that the attracting and secreting of this fire in the various pores tubes and ducts of vetegables did impart their specific virtues to each kind that this same light or fire was the immediate instrumental or physical cause of sense and motion and consequently of life and health to animals that on account of this solar light or fire phoebus was in the ancient mythology reputed the god of medicine which light as it is leisurely introduced and fixed in the viseid juice of old firs and pines so the setting it free in part that is the changing its viscid for a volatile vehicle which may mix with water and convey it throughout the habit copiously and inoffensively would be of infinite use in physic extending to all cases whatsoever inasmuch as all distempers are in effect a struggle between the vis vitae and the peculiar miasma or fomes morbi and nothing strengthens nature or lends such aid and vigor to life as a cordial which does not heat  xiii the solar light in great quantity during the space of many suocessive years being attracted and detained in the juice of ancient evergreens does form and lodge itself in an oil so fine and volatile as shall mix well with water and lightly pass the primae viae and penetrate every part and capillary of the original system when once exempt and freed from the grosser nauseous refin it will not therefore seem unreasonable to whoever is acquainted with the medicinal virtues of turpentine in so many different distempers for which it has been celebrated both by ancient and modern physicians and withal reflects on the nausea or clog that prevents their full operation and effect on the human body it will not i say seem unreasonable to such a one to suppose that if this same clog were removed numberless cures might be wrought in great variety of cases  xiv the desideratum was how to separate the active particles from the heavy viscid substance which served to attract and retain them and so to order matters that the vehicle of the spirit should not on the one hand be volatile enough to escape nor on the other gross enough to offend for the performing of this i have found a most easy simple and effectual method which furnishes a potable inoffensive liquor clear and fine as the best white wine cordial and stomachic to be kept bottled as being endued with a very sensible spirit though not fermented  xv i tried many experiements as to the quantity of water and the time of stirring and standing in order to impregnate and clarify it and after all fixed on the forementioned receipt as the most generally useful for making this salutiferous liquor well impregnated and not offensive to common stomachs and even drank with pleasure by many in which the most medicinal and active particles that is to say the native salts spirit and volatile oil being disentangled from the gross oil and viscous resin can freely pass the primae viae insinuate themselves into the smallest ducts and pervade the whole animal machine and that in such full proportion and measure as suiteth every case and constitution  xvi the foregoing general considerations put me upon making experiments in many various and unlike cases which otherwise i should never have thought of doing and the success answered my hopes philosophical principles led me to make safe trials and on those trials is founded my opinion of the salutary virtues of tar water which virtues are recommended from and depend on experiments and matters of fact and neither stand nor fall with any theories or speculative principles whatever howbeit those theories as i said enlarged my views of this medicine led me to a greater variety of trials and thereby engendered and nourished my suspicion that it is a panacea i have been the more prolix in these particulars hoping that to as many as shall heartily weigh and consider them the high opinion i conceive of this medicine will not seem altogether an effect of vain prepossession or blind empiric rashness but rather the result of free thought and inquiry and grounded on my best reason judgment and experience  xvii those who have only the good of mankind at heart will give this medicine fair play if there be any who act from other motives the public will look sharp and beware to do justice to tar water as well as to those who drink it regard must be had to the particular strength and case of the patients grievous or inveterate maladies must not be treated as common cases i cured a horrible case a gangrene in the blood which had broke out in several sores and threatened speedy death by obliging the person to drink nothing but this liquor for several weeks as much and as often as his stomach would bear common sense will direct a proportionable conduct in other cases but this must be left to the conscience and disceretion of the givers and takers  xviii after all that can be said it is most certain that a panacea sounds odd and conveys somewhat shocking to the ear and sense of most men who are wont to rank the universal medicine with the philosophers stone and the squaring of the circle whereof this chief if not sole reason i take to be that it is thought incredible the same thing should produce contrary effects as it must do if it cures opposite distempers and yet this is no more than every days experience verifies milk for instance makes some costive and others laxative this regards the possibility of a panacea in general as for tar water in particular i do not say it is a panacea i only suspect it to be so  time and trial will show  xix but i am most sincerely persuaded from what i have already seen and tried that tar water may be drank with great safety and success for the cure or relief of most if not all diseases of ulcers itch scaldheads leprosy the foul disease and all foul cases scurvies of all kinds disorders of the lungs stomach and bowels gouty and nephritic ailments pleurifies peripneumonies erysipelas and all kinds of fevers hysteric and all nervous cases dropsies decays and other maladies nor is it of use only in the cure of sickness it is also useful to preserve health and guard against infection and in some measure even against old age as it gives lasting spirits and invigorates the blood i am even induced by the nature and analogy of things and its wonderful success in fevers of all kinds to think that tar water may be useful against the plague both as a preservative and a cure  xx but i doubt no medicine can withstand that execrable plague of distilled spirits which all without exception the fire of the hot still imparting a caustic and coagulating quality to all distilled spirits whatever the subject or ingredients may be operate as a slow poison preying on the vitals and wasting the health and strength of body and soul which pest of human kind is i am told gaining ground in this country already too thin of inhabitants  i am etc  remarks on a letter to the right reverend the bishop of cloyne  occasioned by his treatise of tarwater  an answer to a letter to the right reverend the bishop of cloyne occasioned by his treatise of tarwater when a gentleman had proposed a medicine to the world which from repeated experience he had found to be of singular efficacy one would think he had a right to be heard with candor if not with applause but the author of a letter to the bishop of cloyne has attacked him in a manner as much below the character of a gentleman to offer as a bishop to receive it is to say the least of it what the author professes it to be with the utmost freedom he compares him to a quack a boasting mountebank dr salmon dr rock the devil there is my lord another being whom i have have more reverence than to name in your lordships company and whose actions nothing but the perfect justice and equality of the allusion can atone for my mentioning with your lordships who can cite scripture for his purpose letter p     himself the world will probably guess to be a physician a thorough bread man no doubt and i suppose the great point be has in view is to lie half discovered half concealed ready to be called forth from his present obscurity into practice when he has raised a character by demolishing a writer of eminence  but physician as he supposes the world will take him to be i much doubt whether it may mot give to the bishop even in that respect the preference to make a science a nostrum is as quackish as to make a medicine one knowledge is open to every man of sense and application and has the bishop shown his want of either in his study of physic though it is not more immediately his profession how frequently have physicians turned divines where is the absurdity for a divine to become a physician is the pale of physic only so narrow that it admits of no interlopers what then does this gentleman mean when he tells us page     the principal points of knowledge necessary to a physician are naturally wanting in a divine alas it is not the degree or the robe the tie wig or the goldheaded cane that makes the physician anymore than prunella the parson but the knowledge of either may be concealed under every habit and the seven sciences contained without a college title  need i produce authority or example for this the two great names of bacon and boil will be lasting monuments that the knowledge of physic is not confined to those of the profession only  but the letterwriter says page     he cannot guess from any part of the bishops treatise that he ever made physic his study many others say he talks as rationally of it as those that have this author himself obseves page     that he has searched the books of physicians for histories of diseases and to find out the peculiar properties of medicines no small part of a physicians learning as much i believe as many an one sets up on but because the bishop has applied it to the magnifying his favorite medicine this author will not allow him to have made any improvement from his researches  will it be said that physic has eluded his labors because the theory of it is more extensive than any other the world has generally judged very differently and if we consider how sacredly the avenues to this science are guarded by mysteriously prescribbing things unknown in an unknown tongue how it is conversant with mankind in its weakest state when the mind is drooping and catches at any thing that promises relief the whole faculty ought with humility and thankfulness to acknowledge the reputation the world has given them nay i would appeal to this very writer whether he is not persuaded that even a regular physicians practice does not depend more on his address to the whims and foibles of his patients than his real skill in his profession i ask this when he has compared his own merit with his practice i know his natural pride will extort from him what his artificial pride would tempt him to conceal  to sense and study has not the bishop joined experience experience founded on his own unbounded generosity to the poor itself an hospital without adventitious subscriptions and is he not to be believed when he tells us without fee or reward he has known frequently known after repeated trials upon various constitutions his medicine prove successful the letterwriter says the facts were all page    misunderstood and endeavors to prove from theory that page    tar water is no medicine something hardly worth the name of one and that it can care no one disease nay to make sure work and to be as far in one extreme as the bishop in the other that it can do no good page  0  but may do harm he assures us cold water oured on tar can take none not the least of its medicinal virtues that if we ask the chemist he will tell us oil cannot be mixed with or drawn forth by cold water now in obedience to this gentleman i have asked the chemist and he tells me that some of the virtues of the oil of tar may be drawn forth by cold water and i have actually tasted water wherein the oil of tar was washed two ounces to a pint strongly imbued with its virtues and which had much the same taste with water wherein the oil of benzoin was washed in analyzing tar there are found to come over some fine flowers so quick with the oil that they cannot be separated which may be communicated to water and it is well known all acids will imbibe some part of the flowers or finest part of the oil of all resinous substances as it may afford some satisfaction to the letterwriter and enable others to determine more particularly the virtues of tar i shall set down the product of    pound of the best norway tar by two retorts viz  lib acid spirit     oil      pitch             lost       after theory the letterwriter proceeds to prove that tar water can do no good from experience here then let issue be joined and from one assertion which all the world may judge of let this writers credit stand or fall  crimine ab uno  disce omnes  he says of this medicines power of doing harm we have too many proofs if we could overlook the fatigues of the physicians and apothecaries unable to go through the load of business and the visible increase in the bills of mortality the fatigues of physicians his own i suppose included in that number in the midst of which it was excess of good nature to find time to write so long a pamphlet the increase in the bills of mortality to them then let us go the bishops book was published in england i think about the middle of april the medicine recommended in it came into greatest vogue about the beginning of june and the bills of mortality stand thus      june   christened     buried     decreased       christened       0 increased      0    christened         decreased    so that we see after all this mighty parade about the bills of mortality they were lowest when tar water was in its highest repute or take which period you please afterward for its season before this authors book appeared the alteration was inconsiderable increased the next week    and decreased again    such abundant reason had he to set out with a maxim which he learnt from his own experience more than universal consent that truth and partiality are inconsistent  after these specimens of his skill in the nature of medicines and of his faithfulness in the history of cases he may charge the bishop with deficiency in both particulars and please himself with the thoughts that the world will probably guess himself to be a physician i leave him and it in the quiet possion of that satisfaction  the rest of his letter is chiefly taken up in mirth and pastime he plays the doctor as he calls it and throws out plenty of jokes to gather the crowd together and help off a sixpenny packet  he describes the witty reflections of the company he kept  or such as he has made for them  take a specimen of the weak defender of the bishop and of the acute opponent come says another with a world of important nothing in his look the bishop is a man of sound learning i avouch it and i have read  and what then says another the letterwriter his knowledge is borrowed from the writings of other men page     i wonder how this author got his i fancy as sergeant kite says he came into the world of his own head  another witty observer says the bishop has served his medicine just as pope served him by giving it every virtue under heaven upon which the author notes  unless it be true what some people say that he never praised any body but with an intent that the world should construe it into something more bitter then his severest raillery ibid   great and generous thus with a single roke to destroy the general character of an sent bishop and a poet just cold in his grave but as the discovery it wonderful it ght not to be concealed and there is less reason to expect it should bccause it carries  own reward with it for this author and  friends will go on to construe the rest of  works of that great genius backwards  for the comfort of their party invert the dunciad into a serious panegyric thus for ding out the intention of the poet they all be blessed with their own delusion and  theirs the worlds construction i have ard a story of a hero in bedlam who told a  secret to his friend that it was the world road which was really mad they within ere only reputed to be so it was so they nstrued among one another however others ight misconstrue them  that he may still keep his hand in at play the doctor he examines carefully the very xcrements of the bishops book the index  wonder it was in search of a medicine for  cough and why should not tar and honey  found where album graecum is a medicine  no very different purpose but the difficul is how tar and honey came there since  is not in the body of the book i will not etend to account for the phenomenon but shall only observe almost as odd an one in this writers letter as an instance how the sense of words may be perverted he tells us a story of great effects page    produced by a trifling alteration in the pointing instead of cains saying i have killed a man with a colon at the end which makes it a confession of guilt only write it thus i have killed a man where is the difference this story it seems made him wonder when he heard it and it makes the reader stare when he reads it it should be i suppose have i killed a man but when he tells us how the fame blunder came to stand in his second edition as well as in his first we may find out perhaps how tar and honey came to be in the index only  the bishop having illustrated how acid are sheathed by alkalies from a simile of spigots and faucets this authors modesty i much offended at it hail woodward lives i cannot but admire says he the perfect decency of your lordships manner your excellent cleaness as well as delicacy in smlles which reminds me of the lady that could not bear a chapter of hard names for fear there should be some what immodes in them  but it is not enough that he cut down the bishop in physic unless he makes reprisals upon him in divinity he charges him with making the scriptures serve the turn of his philosophy by new translaitions and even where there was no need of it this i suppose alludes to     where the bishop observes that the passage in the psalms who makes his ministers a flaming fire might as well be rendered and more agreeably to the context who makes flaming fire his ministers if it is more agreeable to the context why will this author say there was no need of the alteration and as to the charge of novelty there is scarce a commentator but gives the passage the same construction though they have nothing to do with the bishiops hypothesis without a pomp of quotations i recommend only to this authors polite taste buchanans version or if that is more suitable to it sternhold and hopkins  apparent accinctae aurae flammaeque ministrae in the same place he says i shall only commemorate to your lordships honor as a bishop that you can soften atheism into misconstruction ay and this very lordship he honors and respects as a bishop whom as a physician he despises it is plain his personal charity is as great as his public zeal which could prompt him to consute an author half dead as he was with the fatigues of practice which that very author had helped him to  but how has his lordship been guilty of lessening atheism why he has vindicated it seems aristotle and some other philosophers from that imputation by showing how their principles have been mistaken atheism the bishop leaves just what it was but shows those venerable sages did not come within the verge of it where is the harm if we will not take them as partners of our natural creed another set of men will be proud of them here our authors zeal gets the better of his charity and he betrays a little of that unsociable temper by which he excluded the clergy from the college of physicians some of whom i am persuaded cure more than many a licentiate from the same turn of mind he seems proud to characterise himself at parting when he lets the bishop know what he should have done to have prevented the attacks of so formidable an adversary then says he page    no carping wit or sour pbilosopher would have dared to have blamed you  finis
