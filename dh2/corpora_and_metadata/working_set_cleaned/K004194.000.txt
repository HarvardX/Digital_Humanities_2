an enquiry into the advantage received by the first eight years inoculation  london printed for j roberts at the oxfordarms in warwick lane      price four pence  an enquiry into the first eight years inoculation it is now about ten years since the inoculation of the small pox has been introduced among us most contrary at first were mens opinions about it some were confident the practice would be of little service that the distemper could not be thus given or if given would not be less dangerous to the patient others that it would be so beneficial as that no one could die of the small pox who thus underwent it  the writers of either side were not a few and many reasons both for and against the practice were daily published  however the inoculation went on and the most impartial judges were of opinion that how plausible soever the reasons might be on either side that the service or disservice of it would best be known by observing the various success of it and then comparing the danger of dying by the inoculation with the danger of dying by the small pox in the natural way  to this end the learned doctors jurin and scheuchzer have taken great pains in getting in the accounts of the success of all the persons inoculated for the first eight years as also of the hazard men underwent who had the small pox in the natural way and with faithfulness not to be called in question have published them  by their accounts it appears that eight hundred and fortyfive persons have received the small pox by the inoculation and that seventeen of them or only one person in fifty has been suspected to have died by it  that in the natural way out of eighteen thousand two hundred and twentynine persons who have been sick of the small pox three thousand and eight persons or one in six has died of it  their conclusion is that if these eight hundred and fortyfive persons had had the small pox in the natural way one in six of them might be reckoned to have died by it that is one hundred and forty or rather one hundred and fortyone persons that is one hundred and twentythree or one hundred and twentyfour more than there died by the inoculation which number of lives they therefore think may actually be reckoned to have been saved by this practice  it is very easy to observe that the advantage here shown is not the real advantage but a supposed one it is grounded upon a supposition that all those eight hundred and fortyfive persons must have undergone the distemper a supposition no otherwise true than that all persons whatever must undergo it which though indeed it has been often asserted is yet a supposition of which every days observation in the death of many persons who never had this distemper demonstrates the falsehood  passing by then this supposed advantage let us enquire into the real one which can only be known by comparing the loss sustained by these eight hundred and fortyfive persons being inoculated not with the loss out of so many persons who actually undergo the distemper but with the loss out of as many who not submitting to the operation take their chance of having it in the natural way  were bills of mortality published for the whole kingdom as there are for london and westminster what this loss would be would easily appear since by them it would be easy to see what proportion the number of those persons who die of the small pox bears to the number of persons who die of all other distempers and consequently in any given number how many would probably die of this distemper or what would be the loss out of the eight hundred and fortyfive persons  but such bills are only to be wished for till we can have more light in this affair we must be contented with such as the london bills afford us  from a table of casualties for twenty years published by the ingenious mr grant it appears that out of two hundred twentynine thousand two hundred and fiftysix persons there died of the small pox ten thousand five hundred and seventysix or one in twentyone  by a table published by dr jurin for fortytwo years one person in fourteen died of this distemper  and by a table published by dr scheuchzer for eight years those years in which the inoculation has been practiced one person in twelve has died of it  which of these tables or whether any of them may be made the standard of the mortality of the small pox will not easily be decided  the favorers of the inoculation will think the last table the most proper to be made the standard and in regard to persons living at london not unjustly but the enemies of it will think and perhaps with as much reason that even the first table represents the small pox too severe to be made the general standard of the danger of it in the whole kingdom  till a better standard can be fixed it may not perhaps be greatly amiss to suppose the last table the standard of the mortality of the small pox at london and the first table the standard for the kingdom in general and so proceed to enquire what benefit has arisen from the inoculation as each of these tables is made the standard of the danger of the small pox in the natural way  by the first table when one person out of twentyone die of the small pox in the natural way then out of eight hundred and fortyfive persons there could only be reckoned to have died forty and whereas there died out of the same number by the inoculation seventeen the lives of twentythree persons only can justly be reckoned to have been saved by this practice  by the second table when one in fourteen died of it in the natural way sixty persons out of the eight hundred and fortyfive would have then died of it and fortythree persons more than there died by the inoculation and  by the last table when in the natural way one out of twelve died of this distemper seventy persons out of the eight hundred and fortyfive would have died of it and fiftythree more than by the inoculation  by all these accounts it appears that many lives have been saved by this practice but that the learned gentlemen in reckoning one hundred and twentythree or one hundred and twentyfour lives seem to have been mistaken  but though fewer lives are lost by the inoculation than in the natural way yet as the loss of them one way is almost present and in the other at some distance of time it cannot appear unjust to make a further deduction on this account from the number of lives saved by the inoculation  out of fifty persons inoculated at a certain time given one of them is supposed to die of the small pox and that presently  should these fifty refuse to submit to the operation about four of them would die and three lives would be saved by the practice  but the time of these having the small pox is yet at a distance suppose at the time given for their inoculation the lives of these persons to be each of the value of thirty years or that these four persons one with another were to live thirty years exclusive of the danger of their dying by the small pox suppose now each of these persons were to live fifteen years from the time given for their inoculation before they had the distemper it is plain these four together would have lived sixty years the value of two lives before they died of this distemper which being deduced out of the four lives that are lost out of the fifty in the natural way two only can be accounted to be lost out of that number and only one life more than in the way of inoculation  what deduction is to be made on this account out of the number of the lives which are saved by the inoculation cannot be determined unless we could first determine from a time given for their inoculation how long those persons may be accounted to live who are supposed to die at last of the small pox in the natural way and then the deduction would be plain and easy  should these persons then be supposed to live a second a third a fourth or sixteenth part of their lives let the fraction whatever it be be multiplied by the number of the persons that are reckoned to die as many unites as the product will be so many lives are to be deduced from those accounted to be saved by the inoculation  when i consider that few persons are inoculated but when the danger seems near of their having the small pox i cannot well suppose them to live longer than one fourth of their lives before they have it and when i consider that persons chiefly inoculated are very young persons and that the mortality of the small pox is mostly among those that are grown up i am not inclined to think they should have it much sooner  let us then suppose that the persons who die at last of the small pox live one fourth of their lives from the time given for their inoculation and the deduction from the number of lives saved by the inoculation will be as follows  according to the first table when forty persons out of the eight hundred and fortyfive die in the natural way each of these forty living one fourth of their lives from the time given for their inoculation together equal to ten whole lives thirty lives only may more justly be said to be lost in the natural way and only thirteen lives more than by the way of inoculation  according to the second table when sixty persons die in the natural way these sixty living each one fourth or together fifteen whole lives fortyfive lives can only then be said to be lost in the natural way and but twentyeight more than by the inoculation  according to the third table when seventy persons die in the natural way these seventy living each one fourth or seventeen whole lives fiftythree lives can only then be said to be lost in the natural way and thirtysix only more than by the inoculation  were this distemper not an infectious one i should here finish this enquiry and determine the advantage to be on the side of the inoculation but it is most certainly otherwise so that it will be proper to inquire farther how far the inoculation of these eight hundred and fortyfive persons may be supposed to have spread this distemper and compare the mischief probably arising from the increased infection with the mischief that is prevented or with the loss of as many lives as are accounted to have been saved by the practice  were these eight hundred and fortyfive persons to take their chance of having the small pox in the natural way it is easy to find out how many probably would have the distemper and how many would escape it  upon the exactest inquiry that could be made and the best accounts that have been given in it appears that one person in six die that has the small pox in the natural way  in any given number then six times the number of the persons who are accounted to die of this distemper should be accounted to undergo it and the remainder to escape it  according to the first table then when out of the eight hundred and fortyfive persons forty only are supposed to die of the small pox in the natural way six times forty or two hundred and forty persons only should be supposed to have this distemper and six hundred and five persons to escape it  according to the first table then when out of the eight hundred and fortyfive persons forty only are supposed to die of the small pox in the natural way six times forty or two hundred and forty persons only should be supposed to have this distemper and six hundred and five persons to escape it  according to the second table when sixty persons are accounted to die three hundred and sixty persons should be supposed to have this distemper and four hundred and eightyfive to escape it  by the third table when seventy persons are reckoned to die of it four hundred and twentytwo persons should be reckoned to have this distemper and as many to escape it  the mischief then arising from the inoculation of these eight hundred and fortyfive persons is the mischief that arises from six hundred and five persons having this infectious distemper who otherwise would probably have escaped it or from four hundred and eightyfive or from four hundred and twentytwo persons as each of these tables is made the standard of the mortality of the small pox in the natural way  the questions then to determine whether the inoculation be of service or not according to the several tables are different and these  according to the first which is better or of more service to mankind the saving of twentythree lives or according to the deduction of thirteen or preventing the mischief which arises from six hundred and five persons having this infectious distemper  according to the second which is better the saving fortythree lives or according to the deduction twentyeight or preventing the mischief from the infection of four hundred and eightyfive persons  according to the third which is better the saving fiftythree or if the deduction is to be allowed thirtysix lives or preventing the mischief from the infection of four hundred and twentytwo persons  these questions may be differently answered and the practice accordingly either universally approved or universally condemned or perhaps allowed in one place and condemned in another  to say there is no mischief to be feared from the increased infections of such a number of persons would be a very bold assertion yet what the mischief probably to be expected is is very difficult to determine  the general if not universal way of having the small pox is accounted to be from infection and the distemper now for some years last past has seemed to have been at a stand that is the mortality of it seems neither to have much increased or diminished and the number of persons that undergo it to have been neither much greater or less  if these propositions are true each person who has the small pox may be supposed the cause of another persons having it  unless therefore the mischief of infection be less from a person inoculated than from one who has the small pox in the natural way the mischief probably to be expected from the increased infection will be as follows  by the first table when from the inoculation six hundred and five persons out of the eight hundred and fortyfive have the small pox who otherwise would have escaped it these six hundred and five infecting or giving the distemper to an equal number and one out of six of them dying according to the standard of the mortality of the small pox to those that have them the mischief from the increased infection will be the loss of the lives of one hundred persons  by the second table when four hundred and eightyfive persons have the small pox who without the inoculation would have escaped them the same number will be by them infected and the mischief will be the loss of the lives of eighty persons  by the third table when four hundred and twentytwo persons have the small pox who without this practice would not have had them an equal number will be infected and the mischief from the increased infection will be the loss of the lives of seventy persons  if these suppositions may be admitted the inoculation for the first eight years appears to have been of great disservice to the world since the lives saved to the persons themselves inoculated fall very short of the lives lost from the increased infection  yet we have only now considered the mischief arising immediately from the first infection from the persons themselves inoculated but the mischief ends not here the persons thus infected may be accounted the causes of a future infection and the small pox with increased strength may descend to our latest posterity  finis
