all in the wrong  a comedy  as it is acted at the theater royal in drury lane  by mr murphy  in amore haec omnia insunt vitia injuriae suspiciones inimicitiae induciae bellum pax rursum  terence london printed for p vaillant facing southamptonstreet in the strand mdcclxi  price  s  d  advertisement the first hint of this comedy was suggested by the cocu imaginaire of moliere who took the idea of his piece from an italian writer though jealousy in all its appearances has been frequently exhibited on the english stage yet it was imagined that a plan which should delineate all the varieties of that passion whether subsisting between lovers or in the matrimonial life and blend them together in one piece would not be unacceptable to the public if therefore there is atonement made for the want of originality of character by the decency of the dialogue the novelty of the fable and the complication of the incidents the author has compassed all that he proposed to himself in the ensuing scenes which with pleasure he finds were the occasion of producing the too long concealed powers of miss haughton and of showing in a distinguished light the exquisite acting of mr obrien  lincolns

park or did she go out at the street door    rob this door sir   sir john robert i will never live in a house again that has two doors to it   rob sir   sir john i will give warning to my landlord instantly  the eyes of argus are not sufficient to watch the motions of a wife where there is a street door and a back door to favor her escapes   rob upon my word sir i wish  you will pardon my boldness sir  i wish you would shake off this uneasiness that preys upon your spirits  it grieves me to the heart  it does indeed sir to see you in this way  banish your suspicions sir  you have conceived some strange aversion i am afraid to my lady sir   sir john no robert no aversion  in spite of me i dote upon her still    rob then why will you not think generously sir of the person you love  my lady i dare be sworn    sir john is false to me  that embitters my whole life  i love her and she repays me with ingratitude with perfidy  with falsehood  with    rob i dare be sworn sir she

indulgent master to me and i am only concerned for your welfare  you married my lady for love and i have heard you so warm in her praise  why will you go back from those sentiments    sir john yes i married her for love  oh love love  what mischief do thou not occasion in this world  yes robert i married her for love  when first i saw her i was not so much struck with her beauty as with that air of an ingenuous mind that appeared in her countenance  her features did not so much charm me with their symmetry as that expression of sweetness that smile that indicated affability modesty and compliance  but honest robert i was deceived  i was not a month married when i saw her practicing those very smiles at her glass  i saw through the artifice plainly saw there was nothing natural in her manner but all forced all studied put on with her headdress  i was alarmed i resolved to watch her from that moment and i have seen such things    rob upon my word sir i believe you wrong her and wrong yourself  you build on groundless surmizes  you make yourself unhappy and my lady too and by being constantly uneasy and never showing her the least love  you will forgive me sir  you sill her mind with strange suspicions and so    sir john suspicions robert   rob yes sir strange suspicions  my lady finds herself treated with no degree of tenderness she infers that your inclinations are fixed elsewhere and so she is become  you will pardon my blunt honesty  she is become downright jealous  as jealous as yourself sir    sir john oh robert you are little read in the arts of women you little know the intricacies of their conduct the mazes through which they walk shifting turning winding running into devious paths but tending all through a labyrinth to the temple of venus  you cannot see robert that all her pretenses to suspect me of infidelity are merely a counterplot to cover her own loose designs  it is but a gauzecovering though  it is seen through and only serves to show her guilt the more   rob upon my word sir john i cannot see    sir john no robert i know you cannot  her suspicions of me all make against her they are but female stratagems and yet it is but too true that she still is near my heart  oh robert robert when i have watched her at a play or elsewhere  when i have counted her oglings and her whisperings her stolen glances and her artful leer with the cunning of her sex she has pretended to be as watchful of me  dissembling false deceitful woman    rob and yet i dare assure you    sir john no more i am not to be deceived i know her thoroughly and now  now  has not she escaped out of my house even now    rob but with no bad design   sir john i am the best judge of that  which way did she go    rob across the park sir  that way sir  toward the horseguards    sir john toward the horseguards  there  there  there  the thing is evident  you may go in robert   rob indeed sir i    sir john go in i say go in    rob there is no persuading him to his own good   exit sir john alone gone toward the horseguards  my head aches  my forehead burns  i am cutting my horns  gone toward the horseguards  i will pursue her thither if i find her her usual artifice will fail her  the time the place will all inform against her  sir john sir john you were a madman to marry such a woman    exit enter beverley and bellmont at opposite sides bev ha my

faith the greatest merit i ever could see in clarissa is that she loves you freely and sincerely   bell and to be even with you sir  your belinda upon my soul notwithstanding all your lavish praises her highest perfection in my mind is her sensibility to the merit of my friend   bev oh bellmont dont talk profanely  such a girl scarce can i to heaven excuse the devotion which i use unto that adored dame but my dear bellmont tell me honestly now do you think she has ever betrayed the least regard for me    bell how can you beverley you that have such convincing proofs how can you ask such a question  that uneasiness of yours that inquietude of mind    bev prithee now dont fix that character upon me    bell it is your character my dear beverley and instead of enjoying the object before you you are ever looking back to something past or conjecturing about something to come and are your own selftormentor   bev no no no dont say so i hate the very notion of such a temper the thing is when a man loves tenderly as i do solicitude and anxiety are natural and when belindas father opposes my warmest wishes    bell why yes the good mr blandford is willing to give her in marriage to me   bev the senseless old dotard    bell thank you for the compliment  and my father the wise sir william bellmont    bev is a tyrannical positive headstrong    bell there again i thank you  but in short

called love and he has stamped such an impression of you here    bev madam your most obedient  and i can tell you that the very same gentleman has been at work for you too    bell  who had been talking apart with clarissa oh he has had a world of business upon his hands for we two have been agreeing what havoc he has made with us   clar yes but we are but in a kind of fools paradise here all our schemes are but mere castlebuilding which your father mr bellmont  and my dear belinda  yours too are most obstinately determined to destroy   bell why as you say they are determined that i shall have the honor of belindas hand in the countrydance of matrimony   belin without considering that i may like another partner better    bev and without considering that i forlorn as i am and my sister there  who is as well inclined to a matrimonial game of romps as any girl in christendom must both of us sit down and lead apes in hell in spite of our strongest inclinations to mingle in the groupe   bell but we have planned our own happiness and with a little resolution we shall be successful in the end i warrant ye  clarissa my angel let us take a turn this way and leave that lovesick pair to

learn since the spirits you were in the whole evening though i enjoyed nothing in your absence  i could hear the sallies of your wit the sprightliness of your conversation and on whom your eyes were fixed the whole night   belin they were fixed upon mr bellmont you think   bev ay and fixed with delight upon him seemed negociating the business of love before the whole company   belin upon my word sir whoever is your author he has misinformed you and let me tell you you alarm me with these fancies and you know i have often told you that you are of too refining a temper  you create for yourself imaginary misunderstandings and then are ever entering into explanations  i assure you mr beverley this watching for intelligence from the spies and misrepresenters of conversation betrays the symptoms of jealousy and i would not be married to a jealous man for the world    bev now she is seeking occasion to break off   aside jealousy maam can never get admission into my breast i am of too generous a temper a certain delicacy i own i have i value the opinion of my friends and when there are circumstances of a doubtful aspect i am glad to set things in their true light  and surely belinda if i do so with others surely with you on whom my happiness depends to desire a favorable interpretation of my words and actions    belin but these little humors may grow up and gather into
