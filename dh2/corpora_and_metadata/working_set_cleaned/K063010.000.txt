that would thy fame in numberstry nor dare in humble verse adore but rise with thee above the sky you ask a bold and lofty strain and what we meanly sing disdain ii you natures early birth explore her disunited frame disclose from what mixed cause and jarring power the infant earth to being rose how in her circling bosom sleep the imprisoned seas and bounded deep iii resolved great hidden truths to trace each learned fable you despise and pleased enjoy the famed disgrace to think and reason singly wise each tale reject by time allowed and nobly leave the erring crowd iv hark from her weak foundations tore the bursting earth asunder flies and propd by yielding seas no more the dreadful crack alarms the skies whose arches rent their weight forego and plunge in opening gulphs below v now rushing from their watery bed the driving waves disdain a shore and with resistless force overspread that orb which checked their rage before while scattered over the foamy tide all natures floating ruins ride vi new heavens disclosed the silver train the sun beneath their waves admire and gliding through the enlightned main gaze at each stars diminished fire well pleased the moons bright orb survey trembling along their azure way vii how strong each line each thought how great with what an energy you rise how shines each fancy with what heat does every glowing page surprise while spouting oceans upward flow or sink again to caves below viii as natures doom you thus impart the moving scene we scarce endure but shrinking ask our anxious heart if on our earth we tread secure whose fate unmoved as you pursue we start and tremble but to view ix yet these remains we now behold which towering once in hills arose shall from a new and fairer mould a new and fairer earth compose which to her fate shall owe her bloom and rise more lovely from her tomb x yet see this beauteous fabric end this second pride of fate expire while gushing from the clouds descend the burning storm the liquid fire where worlds and men consuming lie and in one bright confusion die xi their naked tops the hills admire no longer white with fleecy dew and as they moan the spreading fire add to the flames dissolving too while rocks from melting mountains flow and roll in streams through vales below xii and now the kindling orbs on high all natures mournful end proclaim when thy great work alas must die and feed the rich victorious flame give vigor to the wasting fire and with the world too soon expire xiii once more her bloom the earth renews smoothed into green eternal vales her glebe still moist with fragrant dews her air still rich with balmy gales no change her flowery seasons breed but springs retire and springs succeed xiv oh say thou great thou sacred name what scenes thy thoughtful breast employ capacious as that mighty frame you raise with ease with ease destroy each world shall boast thy fame and you who charmed the old shall grace the new ad d d hannes insignissimum medicum

ingruentes et quem dierum lene fluentium delectat ordo vitaque mutuis felix amicis gaudiisque innocuis been temperata jo addison e coll magd oxon      an ode to dr hannes an eminent physician and poet i while flying over the golden strings you gently wake the tuneful lyre or tender as when orpheus sings with softer sounds the harp inspire sad fleeting ghosts with art constrain back to a kinder life again ii whether in graceful lays you shine and verse your easy hours employ or give the soul her mouldring shrine decayed a fairer to enjoy the body cold in death explore thy skill could only not restore iii awhile thy learned toil decline nor anxious more in smiles allow the circling glass the generous wine tunbend and smooth thy cheerful brow nor longer to thy self severe in the rich draught forget thy care iv now with thy monarchs glory fired let great nassau thy thirst inflame or by his mountague the late earl of halifax inspired record the patriots faithful name by whose wise arts and watchful pains he rules in peace in safety reigns v at length thy mournful task forbear from sadning thoughts some respite find and while we bless thy pious care be to thy self in pity kind inspired with your own blessings live nor want your self that bloom you give vi in vain the bloods tumultuous tide and circling stream your hand restrains taught over the pulses to preside and well explore the bubbling veins that with the fevers swelling heat glow more inflamed more fiercely beat vii in vain you try each chymic power trace to its spring the sanguine wave and kindly search each healing flower for helps to guard us from the grave in endless bloom to bid us live which thou nor they alas can give viii one certain fate by heaven decreed in spite of thee we all must try when from her bursting prison freed the mounting soul shall claim the sky our sons must once lament our doom and shed their sorrows round our tomb ix thou too shall with pale horror see the fabled ghosts which glare below which to the shades restrained by thee in thinner shoals descending flow and death whose power you now defy shall boast her conqueror can die x his life alone is greatly blessed whom no intruding griefs annoy who smiles each happy day possessed of cheerful ease and harmless joy nor sadly soothing his own cares augments himself the weight he bears xi pleased with a few selected friends he views each smiling evening close while each succeeding morn ascends charged with delights unmarked with woes in pleasures innocently gay wears the remains of life away
