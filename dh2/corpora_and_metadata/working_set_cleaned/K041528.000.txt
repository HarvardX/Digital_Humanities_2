dvblin printed by s powell for g risk g ewing and w smith booksellers in dames street mdccxxvii  a poem etc let gaudy mirth to the blithe carrolsong in loose lightmeasurd numbers dance along thou muse no flowery fancies here display nor warble with the cheerful lark thy lay in the dark cypress grove or mossgrown cell where dreary ravens haunt would sorrow dwell where ghosts that shun the day come sweeping by or fix in melancholy frenzys eye yet now she turns her flight to scenes of state where wealth and grandeur weep the frowns of fate wealth want rank power here each alike partakes as the shrub bends the lofty cedar shakes to her wide view is no contraction known it is youth it is age the cottage and the throne o exclamation lend thy sad relief o dodington indulge the righteous grief distant i have long beheld in thee transcend the poet patron patriot and the friend thou who must live in truths remotest page formed to delight and dignify an age whose words whose manners and whose mind declare each grace each moral and each muse are there accept this poesy void of venal aim made sacred by thy royal masters name but why o muse are songfulhours thy choice lost is the life whose glory lifts thy voice george is no more as at the doomful sound of the last trump all nature feels the wound each private each distinguished virtue bleeds and what but lamentation long succeeds where will thou then for apt allusions fly what eloquence can throbbing grief supply late golden pleasures urged their shining way with george they flourished and with george decay now dusky woes over varied scenes extend groans rise rocks echo and chill damps descend grief strikes my view with everweeping eyes at her wan look each lively fancy dies in fear in hope dull rest or rufling storms thus woe besets us tho in various forms that dire event of youths ungoverned rage that dearbought knowledge to declining age in want in scorn it haunts an humble state it is care it is envy to perplex the great a kingdoms curse it in dissension brings or heavier falls when falls the best of kings worth it exalts when aiming to debase it is virtues triumph or it is guilts disgrace it humbles life yet dignifies our end reflections torment yet reflections friend then let the muse her meaning notes resume and pay due sorrows to the hallowed tomb was there a glory yet to greatness known that not in brunswicks soul superior shone ill fare the man who robbed in purple pride to wounded worth has no relief applied benevolence makes power to prudence dear when pity weeps what pearl excells the tear when not one virtue glows to bless mankind when prides cold influence petrifies the mind let the prince blaze with jems  in wisdoms view an emblem of the rock where once they grew yet springs gush out to prove even rocks can flow in rills refreshful to the vales below why has he power and why no heart to cheer unseeing eyes and ears that will not hear swift as his bliss shall his light name decay who selfindulgent sports his hours away but oh  what love what honor shall he claim whose joy is bounty and whose gift is fame he truly great his useful power refines by him discovered worth exalted shines exalted worth the enlivening act repeats and draws new virtues from obscure retreats he as the first creative influence praised smiles over the beings which his bounty raised such dodington thy royal master shined such thou the image of thy monarchs mind nations were balanced by his guardian skill like the poised planets by the allpowerful will mark the swede succored mark the aspiring czar checked are his hopes and shunned the naval war by george the austrian eagle learns to tower while the proud turk shakes conscious of her power but when her menace braves our envied shore she trembles
