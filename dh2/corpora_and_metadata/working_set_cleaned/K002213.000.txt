medical advice to the consumptive and asthmatic people of england  price one shilling  medical advice to the consumptive and asthmatic people of england wherein the present method of treating disorders of the lungs is shown to be futile and fundamentally wrong and a new and easy method of cure proposed by philip stern m d  london printed for j almon opposite burlington house in piccadilly  mdcclxvii    medical advice to the consumptive people of england if it should be asked why i address myself to the patient rather than to the physician i answer that having offended the doctor in my title page i presume he will give but little attention to my reasoning for we listen very unfavourably to the advice of a man who begins by asserting that we are fundamentally wrong but with the patient the case is different recollecting that consumptions in the present mode of practice are very rarely cured he almost assents to the truth of my assertion even before he has heard the arguments upon which it is founded i speak therefore not immediately to the physician because i do not like that a man should turn his back on me when i am talking to him if the doctor chooses whilst i am conversing with my patient to look another way yet squint an ear to my babbling he is very welcome provide he will not condemn my practice till he has proved its futility by experience  now though i write not directly to medical gentlemen i esteem it nevertheless necessary to proceed methodically and accordingly shall premise as much of the anatomical and physiological description of the lungs as will be sufficient to enable those who have not had a medical education to comprehend my arguments i shall then enquire into the predisposing and immediate causes of consumptions shall indicate the symptoms by which the patient may be certain of his disorder and shall lastly proceed to consider the cure upon rational principles  the trunk of the human body is divided by a membrane called the diaphragm into two distinct cavities the lower of which is called the abdomen or belly and the upper the thorax or chest the latter of these cavities contains the heart and the lungs the lungs are divided into two principal lobes which are enclosed in two distinct bags formed by a membrane called the pleura so that the right and left lobe of the lungs have not the least communication the adhesion of these bags near the middle of the chest forms a perpendicular membrane called the mediastinum but receding from each other as they go lower down they form a third bag called the pericardium which contains the heart so that the chest is divided into three separate cavities  the lungs are composed of blood vessels air vessels lymphatic or water vessels nerves and cellular membrane  the blood vessels are arteries and veins but these are of two distinct kinds the first receive and return the whole mass of blood which circulates through the lungs before it is thrown into the other parts of the body and the second were intended only for the support and nourishment of the lungs themselves  the air vessels are infinitely small branches continued from the windpipe with which in a sound state they have a free communication so as at every inspiration to be filled with air  the lymphatic vessels are distributed on the surface of the lungs and convey the lymph which they imbibe to a certain duct whence it is returned to the mass of blood  the nerves are exceeding small branches which proceed chiefly from what is called the eighth pair  the cellular membrane which fills the intermediate parts between the vessels is composed of fibers or lamina which are neither vascular nor endowed with sensibility  the asperaarteria or windpipe is that tube which conveys the air passing through the mouth or nose to and from the lungs it is composed of alternate cartilaginous and fleshy rings behind which are an infinite number of small glands which supply the windpipe with a thin pellucid mucus lining its internal surface which consists of a membrane of exquisite sensibility  thus much being premised we shall now proceed to the office and utility of the lungs which are necessary to be understood before we speak of its diseases  the organs of respiration are so indispensably necessary to our existence it is no wonder that physiologists should have taken uncommon pains to discover the real design of nature in their formation various have been the conjectures of authors on this subject some have supposed that the blood in passing through the lungs acquires its red color others have been of opinion that the intention of respiration is to receive a certain quantity of air which they imagined necessary to be mixed with the vital fluid with many other suppositions equally without foundation that nature by first circulating the blood through the lungs after the reception of fresh chyle intend some necessary preparation may be concluded without farther examination and that this preparation is effected by throwing off a certain quantity of noxious matter imbibed by the air which is received by the lungs seems evident from the experiments which prove that air once saturated with this noxious matter is unfit for respiration the notion that animals when confined to breathe the same air die because the elasticity of the air is destroyed is entirely without foundation it being very easy to prove that the elasticity of the air is not in the least diminished the use therefore of respiration is to relieve the body from a certain matter perspirable only from the lungs which if entirely retained is incompatible with existance and when retained in part is productive of disease it is separated from the blood by means of small ducts passing from the pulmonary arteries to the air vessels where it is dissolved and carried off by the air the existence of these ducts is easily demonstrated by injecting almost any liquor into the pulmonary artery which liquor may without much difficulty be made thus to fill the branches of the windpipe  supposing that we are now pretty well acquainted with the fabric and office of the lungs we may i think with safety proceed to the more immediately object of our attempt  the general predisposing causes of a consumption of the lungs are to be sought for in the original formation of the body the acrimony of the juices or the age of the patient as to the first of these causes without reasoning about the matter it is sufficient for our purpose to observe that people of a slender and delicate frame whose skin appears remarkably transparent whose chest is flat and narrow and shoulders high are in general more subject to this disease than people of a contrary make because say the learned the vessels of the lungs are in such bodies too fine and too weak to resist the impetus of the blood flowing with great rapidity through the organ of respiration a rupture of the vessels a spitting of blood etc are the consequence the same effects may be produced by an extraordinary acrimony in the fluids which may corrode the vessels and as to the third cause it is attributed to the fervor of the blood which is supposed to be greatest at the age when people are most liable to consumptions to a sagacious reader part of this reasoning will appear plausible and part otherwise but these are remote causes which are equally applicable to all countries and which do not in the least assist us in accounting for the peculiar consumptive propensity in the inhabitants of this island  this propensity must be accounted for not by any predisposition in the make of our bodies but by what is called a procatarctic or occasional cause namely the instability of our climate or rather its immediate effect a cold to which i am convinced the frequency of consumptions in this kingdom is chiefly to be attributed  what is a cold and what are its effects  the questions are of importance let us not therefore be too precipitate experience our best instructor has taught us that nothing is so detrimental to the human body as sudden transitions from one extreme to another but it is particularly true in regard to heat and cold the natural effect of warm air is to relax the skin consequently to open our pores and consequently to increase our perspiration an effect which may reasonably be supposed to take place equally in the lungs as on the surface of the body when the body in this state is suddenly exposed to a cold air the consequence is an immediate spasm over its whole surface the pores are obstinately closed and the perspirable matter is gradually returned into the mass of blood  that this perspirable matter is of an exceeding acrid nature is evident from its effects by irritating the vessels it increases their oscillations which increasing the circulation produces fever its acrimony appears even in the very first symptom of a cold the pores of the head have scarce been closed a moment before the perspirable matter falling upon the membrane which lines the nose causes by its irritation that convulsive motion which we call sneezing it returns upon the glands about the windpipe and issuing thence excites another convulsive motion called a cough which are different efforts of nature to rid herself of the offending cause in oozing down the windpipe it destroys the mucus therefore we are hoarse and by inflaming the membrane which lines the trachia occasions that sensation of soreness in the breast which we feel in a few hours after taking cold thus continually descending it enters the branches of air vessels and diffusing itself to every part of the lungs occasions the cough which we so easily distinguish from that which proceeds from an irritation in the upper part of the windpipe and which we call a tickling cough  we are not however to imagine that this acrid lymph which falls from above is the sole cause of irritation in the lungs on the contrary it is more probable that they are principally offended by the acrimony of that which issues from their own peculiar glands for in severe colds that is when the obstruction of perspiration is almost universal for it is never entirely so in such cases i say every humor in the body is contaminated and that very mucus which in health prevents irritation in the air vessels of the lungs is now the principal cause  inflammation is the natural consequence of this continued irritation which as naturally produces a superabundant secretion of mucus and which if not constantly spit up suffocates the patient when these symptoms are violent the disease is called a peripneumony but if this inflammation continues beyond a certain time the vessels are destroyed and become dissolved in a kind of mattercalled pus  thus we are arrived at the immediate or proximate cause of a consumption of the substance of the lungs but here it may naturally be asked how it happens when a part of an organ so indispensibly necessary to life is destroyed that the patient does not immediately die i answer that nature in this instance has been particularly kind to us for the two lobes of the lungs having no communication are not immediately affected by each others diseases besides every minute branch of the same lobe is so contrived as to perform its office independent of the rest therefore every single vessel continues to receive and return its portion of air till it be actually destroyed hence it is that in dissecting of bodies which have died consumptive we frequently find a considerable part of the lungs entirely destroyed indeed the appearance of the lungs in those who have died of this disease is so various that though it may be but of one genus the number of species are extremely numerous if we may conclude from the diversity of phenomena upon dissection sometimes we find the texture of a part of the lungs entirely destroyed and nothing but a collection of purulent matter in its place communicating with the windpipe so as to fill it on laying the head downward at other times we discover a quantity of matter enclosed in a kind of bag sometimes this matter is contained in a number of small follicles and at others it may be squeezed from every part and the texture of the lungs but little injured in some cases we find a number of small hard lumps in others large indurations and sometimes tumors that are absolutely cancerous in short as i have before observed the variety of appearances is infinite especially if we include color  however notwithstanding this great diversity the proximate cause of that species of consumption which is so frequent and so fatal in this kingdom is an ulcer in the lungs in consequence of inflammation occasioned by a cold or in other words by a greater flux of acrid perspirable matter to the lungs than can be absorbed and carried off by the air it is also possible that a part of this matter may be confined near the extremities of the air vessels by a spasmodic constriction in the upper part occasioned by the sudden admission of cold air when this is the case an enclosed ulcer or vomica is the consequence  having proceeded thus far in the consideration of our subject and i think without straining our text we are now naturally led from the cause to the cure of our disease and first it may not be amiss to enquire a little into the foundation of the general practice  the first thought which naturally occurs is that this general practice is generally unsuccessful and we thence as naturally conclude that it must be fundamentally wrong  if the inflammation be violent comparing it with inflammations in other parts of the body and reasoning from analogy the first thing we do is to bleed and so far we are right as by lessening the quantity of blood we lessen the impetus of the remaining part and thereby retard the progress of the disease for a time but alas the time is very short the pulse soon recovers its velocity and strength well but then we administer a quantity of saccharine oily and mucilaginous medicines in the form of an emulsion or otherwise intending no doubt thereby to sheathe and obtund the acrimony which causes the irritation in the lungs the intention is certainly laudable but it happens unfortunately that these balsamics go down not into the lungs but into the stomach where they immediately undergo such a change as to carry but little of their balsamic qualities even into the intestines where they are still farther mixed and adulterated particularly by the addition of a certain quantity of bile immediately on quitting the stomach  but to proceed let us suppose these demulcents already in the intestines what becomes of them they must either be received by the lacteal vessels or pass off per anum the latter of which is the way chosen by the greatest part of them contrary to the intention of the physician happily for mankind these lacteal vessels are endowed with a kind of mechanical sagacity which enables them to select from that heterogeneous mass of food and medicines constantly presented to them by the stomach such matter only under the denomination of chyle as is fit to be assimulated with the blood  here i shall be interrupted with an objection that the lacteals are capable of admitting poisonous matter and conveying it to the heart to the immediate destruction of the body to this objection having first hinted that most poisons are destructive from their immediate action on the nerves in the stomach i answer that nature acts not by partial but by general laws those who are incapable of applying this argument deserve no other reply  let us now suppose that a small portion of our balsamics has gained admittance through the mouths of the lacteals thence it is conveyed into the glands of the mesentery and having been secerned through several of these it rises into a certain receptacle whence it is conducted into a vein under the left arm and thus mixes with the blood it now soon reaches the heart and from thence thus mingled with blood it passes through the lungs i say through the lungs because it is immediately returned to the heart thence to be distributed through the rest of the body  now it must be remembered that the seat of the disorder which by these healing medicines we are endeavoring to cure is not in the blood vessels but in the air vessels of the lungs and that these air vessels have no communication with the arteries except by means of tubes or pores so extremely small as not to admit the red globules of the blood consequently the constituent particles of our medicine must be smaller than these otherwise no part of it can possibly be thus applied to the part injured but we have said that a liquor may by injection through the pulmonary artery be forced into the bronchia true but this liquor passes colorless always depositing in its passage the matter with which it was tinged  these things being properly considered let me now ask the reader whether he thinks it probable that even the least benefit can rationally be expected from saccharine oily mucilaginous or balsamic medicines thus applied  what then is to be done has nature been so unkind particularly to the inhabitants of this island as to afflict us with a disease for which there is no remedy i verily believe she has not been so unkind the fault is not in nature but in ourselves or perhaps rather in the difficulty of the task for we cannot suppose in the present improved state of chemistry and anatomy that all thinking men are not perfectly sensible of the improbability i had almost said impossibility of applying demulcents to the lungs through the alimentary canal nor is it more reasonable to suppose them forgetful that the only possible way of applying medicines directly to the lungs is through the windpipe but as i have before observed they have been prevented from attempting this obvious method by the difficulties which occurred in the execution  to convey any palpable solid or liquid substance through the windpipe into the lungs we know to be impossible for that if the least crumb of bread or drop of any liquor happens by accident to enter the glottis a violent cough is immediately excited till the offending matter be rejected but we also know that impalpable volatile matter is incessantly carried to and from the lungs along with the air every substance therefore that can be volatilized may be conveyed directly to the lungs aqueous liquors may be easily converted into vapor and vapor may be impregnated with great variety of medicinal substances  on these considerations it should now seem that the whole mystery is at once discovered and that we have nothing more to do than to convert our proper medicines into vapor and so convey them directly to the diseased part alas there are many considerable obstacles yet to surmount as will appear from a chemical view of the medicines in question  let us suppose that our patient having caught a severe cold labors under an inflammation of that membrane or skin which is continued from the mouth down the windpipe into the bronchia and that this inflammation is chiefly in the lungs or let us suppose that the irritating matter is not sufficiently acrid to produce much inflammation but only a superabundant secretion of acrid mucus or let us farther suppose that the lungs are actually ulcerated in these several stages or degrees of the disorder what are the indications  our endeavors to restore the obstructed perspiration is undoubtedly rational but our medicines given with this intention commonly fail they excite indeed a copious sweat but the fluid thus determined to the surface of the body is totally different from that volatile matter which in a sound state exhales particularly from the lungs and to the diminution of which exhalation the disease in question is solely to be attributed but what is the present danger it is that the inflammation may end in suppuration or that the acrid matter may be obstructed by mucus or spasm and so corrode indurate or destroy the substance of the lungs the immediate indication therefore is if possible to prevent these consequences which i presume can only be effected by the application of antiseptic that is medicines which resist putrefaction antispasmodic attenuating and balsamic medicines directly to the part affected  with regard to the first viz antiseptics there is no difficulty the most powerful of them i speak from experience being in their nature volatile antispasmodies and attenuants are equally easy of conveyance so that the sole difficulty lies in our balsamic medicines which are very refractory but of great importance  gums mucilages and expressed oils are by no means volatile nor would i in the present case give one farthing to find them otherwise as they would at any rate be totally unfit for our present purpose our whole attention therefore is fixed on the resinous native balsams but not indiscriminately those who have bestowed so much attention on them as myself will find them extremely different in their chemical properties and effects on the human body besides they are rarely to be met with genuine and a thorough knowledge of them is only to be acquired by long experience and frequent examination  the chief of the liquid balsams are balsam of gilead of copaiba of peru of tolu of canada and the dry balsams are benjoine storax labdanum myrrh and mastich and the terpentines but though these several substances are much alike in their chemical properties yet they differ essentially in their medical virtues which is easily accounted for from the difference in quantity and quality of the etherial oil which they contain  the chemical properties as far as they are commonly known of these fragrant resins or balsams are that they are inflammable dissoluble in rectified spirits but not in water now this being the case supposing even after a thousand experiments that we have fixed upon those whose oils are least acrid and which in every respect are best fitted for our purpose how shall we possibly contrive to convey them to the lungs in a proper vehicle they will not dissolve in water and the vapor of spirit of wine is much too ardent and inflammatory  if indeed we had remained satisfied with these general properties without farther enquiry we should still have believed with our neighbors that the attempt was impracticable that it was impossible to apply an efficacious remedy directly to the lungs and consequently that consumptions were incurable  ever since i was capable of enquiry it has been a constant maxim with me to take nothing for granted upon any authority whatsoever upon this principal i began my experimental disquisitions relative to the subject in question being fully persuaded for reasons which will hereafter appear that if i could find means to convey the best of these native fragrant balsams to the lungs in a mild and truly balsamic state the consumptive people of this island might expect considerable benefit from my success  were i to relate the many fruitless experiments i have made since i first engaged in this enquiry the reader would be surprised at my patience and perseverance but it would answer no other purpose let it suffice therefore to tell him that i at last hit upon a certain chemical liquor which to my great astonishment dissolved at least double the quantity of the balsamic resins which i had selected to any menstruum which i had ever tried or heard of the pleasure i felt upon this discovery can only be conceived by those who have had the happiness to extend in any degree the path of knowledge it immediately occurred to me that the discovery of so powerful a menstruum would not only be a considerable step in my present pursuit but might probably prove of singular advantage to medicine in general but what added greatly to my expectations was that this liquor happens to be of exceeding volatility not at all inflammatory and remarkably antiseptic and antispasmodic  thus far i had obtained every thing that i could wish my solution however was too strong for the purpose i intended i therefore by way of experiment dropped a few drops of it into boiling water and found beyond all possibility of a doubt that the steam was richly impregnated both with the antispasmodic and antiseptic qualities of the menstruum and also with the balsamic and salubrious principles of the fragrant resins this vapor i drew in with my breath for a considerable time and found it not in the least irritating but on the contrary extremely mild and agreeable being now desirous to ascertain the quantity of the dissolved resins which thus rose with the vapor i poured half an ounce of my solution into a quantity of hot water and after evaporating the whole i found remaining in the vessel a very small proportion of the weight of balsam which had been dissolved in that quantity and consequently by much the greatest part had risen with the vapor  let me now ask the reader whether he is not of opinion that the happiest effects may rationally be expected from such a medicine thus applied by means of the steam of hot water directly to the injured lungs whether he does not think it probable that the acrimony of the irritating fluid will be thus obtunded either in a recent cold or more advanced state of the disease whether the spasmodic constriction of the vessels will not thus be relaxed and the consequence of obstructions prevented whether the progress of putrefaction may not thus be stopped and whether in that case even in the advanced stage of a consumption we may not hope for a cure  when a considerable part of the substance of both lobes of the lungs is destroyed the disease is doubtless incurable but we know from diffection that commonly one lobe only is principally affected if therefore we can thus stop the progress of putrefaction in the diseased lobe the other may continue to perform its office and the patient suffer but little inconveniency  there remains yet another argument in favor of this new method of application which i think will appear to be a powerful one we know that many people who have been far gone in a consumption have recovered by removing to happier climates we cannot rationally attribute their recovery to any other cause than a difference in the air they breathe which difference must arise from its being impregnated with certain salubrious antiseptic or balsamic effluvia since therefore this natural application of salutiferous air to the part affected will produce that which medicines taken into the stomach had attempted in vain are we not thereby naturally led to conclude that the best way of administering to the lungs is by means of the air it were ridiculous to attribute the recovery of consumptive people on their migration to a milder climate merely to increase of heat which might be increased to any degree in the patients chamber at home on the contray we know that heat remarkably accelerates putrefaction so that in a putrid state of the lungs if it were not for some powerful counteracting cause the disease by traveling southward must necessarily be increased  with regard to the manner of applying this medicine it is extremely easy i usually drop  0 drops into about half a pint of boiling water immediately after it is taken from the fire ordering the patient to hold his mouth over the vessel so as to draw in with his breath as much as possible of the vapor continuing the operation as long as the steam will rise i then order him to drink the water as soon as it is cold enough for that purpose for though i depend entirely on the vapor for the cure of the lungs yet as all the juices in the body may be in some degree affected by the matter absorbed from the lungs this balsamic water received into the stomach will be of some advantage  this simple method of application will be abundantly sufficient in common colds hoarseness etc but when there is reason to  and from its antiseptic power that it will prevent putrefaction or stop its progress when begun and thus preserve the sound part of the lungs and give an opportunity to nature to regenerate the parts that were already destroyed  what says the sagacious reader do you imagine if a part of the lungs be actually destroyed that it can ever be restored  sir it is a maxim with me never to affirm any thing which i cannot prove but i know no reason why nature should not as easily restore a part of the lungs as a part of an external muscle or a part of the external skin which is continued into the lungs and which is as vascular as the lungs themselves  i shall now beg leave to add a few words concerning the diet etc of consumptive people for though our opinion of a medicine be ever so great it were certainly imprudent to neglect such other means as may contribute to its success and indeed if the disease be far advanced little is to be expected from any medicine whatsoever unless the patient will adhere implicitly to the rules prescribed by his physician relative to his diet and manner of living  first with regard to exercise our immortal sydenham was so strongly prepossessed in favor of riding on horseback that he constantly recommended that exercise in every stage of a consumption it is however with this as with most efficacious medicines if it does no good it certainly does harm the patient himself will be able to determine whether its effects be salutary or otherwise by observing the following directions first unless the weather be hot let his clothing be somewhat warmer than usual as he will otherwise grow chilly let him ride not more than an hour at a time and that very gently if it be in spring or autumn he must ride from eleven to twelve or from twelve to one if in the hotter months let it be from nine to ten in the morning but in moist or cold weather let him not ride at all if after this gentle exercise he finds himself in better spirits his appetite increased his breathing easy and his skin cool and soft he may certainly conclude that riding is of service to him and ought therefore to be continued as often as the weather will permit if on the contrary he finds himself fatigued his breathing more frequent and more difficult his skin parched and dry the palms of his hands hot his cheeks flushed his tongue dry and in himself an inclination to drink rather than eat he may then conclude that riding is improper in the present state of his disorder and that taking the air in a carriage will have better effects if nevertheless he finds no alteration for the better i advise him by all means to have recourse to a sea voyage from which with the continuance of the medicine here recommended i venture to promise him every thing that human art can possibly supply it may not be improper to observe that though i have above in speaking of riding limited the patient to an hour at a time i mean that in proportion to his increase of strength and benefit received the time should be prolonged and the degree of exercise augmented  we come now to aliment which is of infinite importance the first general rule which i give to my consumptive patients is that regardless of all stated hours he is to eat as often as he has an appetite but never much at a time if when he rises in a morning he finds no appetite for his breakfast let him walk a little into the air and wait an hour or two before he takes any food as to tea i absolutely forbid it because it is an enemy to weak nerves but more especially on account of the warm water which greatly relaxes the stomach a sea biscuit with a pint of cold almond milk made with barley water or whey is a good breakfast for a consumptive person or a few almonds blanched and ground in a mortar with a little cold water and then mixed by little at a time with two thirds of milk from the cow is still better where more nourishment is required this admixture of almonds renders the curd which separates in the stomach much less tenacious and easier of digestion i mention cows milk because it is most easily obtained otherwise asses milk is certainly preferable because it contains much less of curd which is both difficult of digestion and putrescent goats milk contains even a greater proportion of curd than cows milk and therefore highly improper though frequently prescribed  eggs are by no means to be allowed on account of their putrifactive tendency in short animal food is in general to be avoided though if the patient be weak i allow a little boiled white meat once or twice a week and now and then a little veal or chicken broth with a small quantity of lemon juice squeezed into it potatoes turnips carrots parsneps beans spinach broccoli sallets bread and rice constitute our general bill of fare  as to drink if the patient has much hectic fever i confine him entirely to almond milk barley water or milk and water otherwise besides these he is permitted to drink one or two glasses of mountain wine every day or in case that cannot be afforded now and then a draught of ale porter or table beer  if the patient complains of a nausia weight or uneasiness at his stomach i order him ten grains of ipecacoanha with chamomile tea to be repeated once in ten days or a fortnight if the symptoms return  with regard to bleeding as i expect nothing more from it than a little present relief i never order it unless when the fever runs too high and then i seldom exceed five ounces  if the patient be costive i order him a solution of manna with a little soluble tartar if the contrary i give him occasionally a few drops of the thebaic tincture in a little simple cinnamon water  if he sweats toward morning which is often the case i order him to go to bed in good time to rise very early and to repose a little after dinner if his sweat still continue i give him  0 or  0 drops of the acid elixir of vitriol in a glass of cold water twice a day as to the peruvian bark on this occasion i believe it to be an excellent medicine but i dislike it in substance for many reasons and am no less dissatisfied with all the known preparations of it i have lately begun a course of tedious experiments with an intention to discover the parts in which its virtues actually reside and to divest it of those which are inert if i am not much mistaken in my conjectures it is possible to condence its active principles into a very small compass and thereby to render it a much more agreeable and efficacious medicine if i succeed possibly the public may in some future time expect to be made acquainted with the result of my enquiries  there remains yet one piece of advice to which the patient if he regards his own safety will be particularly attentive it concerns the position of his body consumptive people from an indolence peculiar to their disorder are very apt whether sitting walking or riding to suffer the body to bend forward for want of a proper exertion of those muscles by which it should be kept erect in this drooping position the chest is never sufficiently enlarged nor the lungs fully expanded i therefore constantly advise my patients to keep themselves upright and especially when in the open air to endeavor to bring their breast as forward as possible in this my intention is to expand the small ramifications of the bronchus to their extremities and to open a free passage for the blood from and to the heart both which will assist our endeavors to remove obstructions and prevent those adhesions of the lungs to the pleura which are generally found on dissection of consumptive bodies see morgagni de sedib and causis morborum   my asthmatic patients no doubt begin to think me tedious or rather imagine that i have quite forgot them that however is not the case by an asthma we mean that disorder the chief symptom of which is a difficulty of breathing it is either continued or by fits now though the cause of this disease is frequently in the lungs yet it is sometimes owing to a morbid affection of some of the other organs of respiration as the diaphragm the intercostal muscles or the windpipe or some of the neighboring viscera how it happens that the balsmic medicines which are recommended as a cure for consumptions are at the same time recommended in asthmatic complaints is amazing and must proceed either from consummate ignorance or unpardonable dishonesty if as we have seen above these balsamics taken into the stomach can do nothing toward the cure of a consumption how much less likely are they to relieve an asthmatic patient for if they could even be applied immediately to the part affected they possess no one virtue that might authorize such expectation  hold cries the reader if that be the case how comes it that you recommend your balsamic vapor for the cure of an asthma i answer that unless the asthma be a symptom of a consumption i expect no advantage from the balsamic quality of this vapor but when the cause of the asthma is a spasmodic contraction of the lungs or windpipe which is very frequently the case especially when the disease returns by fits i then expect considerable advantage from the antispasmodic power of this vapor and when in a continued difficulty of breathing the cause of the disorder is an infarction of the lungs from viscid mucus my hopes are then built on the attenuating power of the vapor exhibited in the manner i recommend let those who are capable of reasoning judge whether my expectations are well founded  i have said that the peculiar consumptive disposition observable in the people of this kingdom is to be attributed to the instability of our climate which renders us so frequently liable to take cold now as it is always better to prevent a disorder than to cure it and as colds do no injury to the lungs except in their remote effects i thought it rational to suppose if immediately after taking cold i could dilute or obtund the acrimony of the humor which irritates and inflames the lungs i should probably prevent the bad consequences of obstructed perspiration at least as far as it concerned the lungs having myself lately taken a violent cold i immediately began to use the balsamic vapor by holding my head over a common pint vessel keeping my mouth generally shut that the steam might pass through my nose and repeating the operation several times a day for two or three days the consequence of this was that i very soon got rid of my cold without the least cough or difficulty of breathing which was really a remarkable circumstance because my lungs are naturally so irritable that i hardly remember ever to have had the least degree of cold which did not end in a cough this however is but a single experiment but i have another of greater weight  having founded my expectations in the cure of consumptions which are far advanced chiefly on the antiseptic quality of this ether in order to try its power i suspended from two nails at the distance of about four foot from each other two pieces of fresh beef under one of these i held a vessel of hot water into which fifteen drops of the medicine were dropped repeating the operation three or four times every day and continuing it about five minutes each time to the other piece nothing was applied i carefully examined each piece every day and was greatly surprised to find at the expiration of a month that neither of them was in the least tainted or discolored that the piece to which the vapor was applied continued sweet did not at all surprise me but i own i did not expect that the antiseptic power of this vapor was so great as to prevent putrefaction in the other piece of beef by only mixing with the air in the room indeed the room was small this unexpected event however gave me great pleasure as it immediately suggested to me the evident advantage that might be expected in all putrid disorders from impregnating the air in the chamber with this vapor for this purpose it is my constant practice to order  0 or  0 drops to be dropped into a quart of boiling water and the vessel to be placed near the bed of the patient to be repeated three or four times a day or the water to be kept boiling over a lamp in any part of the room till it is entirely evaporated if the disorder be of a very putrid nature and especially in the small pox it were certainly needless to mention the use of this vapor in sore throats whether inflammatory or putrid  the medicine is entitled dr sterns balsamic ether and may be had for six shillings the bottle of mr almon in piccadilly mr cook near the royal exchange mr

to the reader which may enable him to judge properly of medicines which are exposed to sale these rules seem the more necessary in an age when almost every week produces a new medicine  the first general rule is never to pay the least regard to the canting of those who pretend that the good of mankind is their sole motive for offering their medicine to sale  secondly disregard all assertions concerning the excellency of a medicine which are mere assertions without any foundation in reason and experiment  thirdly conclude the advertizer to be either a knave or a fool in physic who pretends that his medicine will cure several disorders which have not the least analogy to e other  fouthly give no credit to the recital of cases as they are generally invented by the doctor  and lastly when the doctor writes a pamphlet with an intention to recommend his medicine if it betray a manifest ignorance of his subject of style and grammar in short when his language is evidently that of a porter conclude him to be some illiterate ignorant person whose medicine and opinions deserve no attention  concerning myself and the medicine i recommend i do not expect that the reader should have any

to convict me of falsehood or confirm the truth all i expect of the reader is that he will impartially consider the reasons upon which i have founded my expectations of curing disorders of the lungs by means of this balsamic vapor if he is of opinion that i have reasoned justly he will certainly think it advisable for those whose lungs are injure to try the experiment especially as it cannot possibly be attended with any danger and as to the expense it will certainly be thought most inconsiderable when compared with the fees of a physician and the bills of an apothecary  finis
