a tour in scotland mdcclxix  tros tyriusque mihi nullo discrimine agetur chester printed by john monk mdcclxxi  to sir roger mostyn bart of mostyn flintshire dear sir a gentleman well known to the political world in the beginning of the present century made the tour of europe and before he reached abbeville discovered that in order to see a country to best advantage it was infinitely preferable to travel by day than by night  i cannot help making this applicable to myself who after publishing three volumes of the zoology of great britain found out that to be able to speak with more precision of the subjects i treated of it was far more prudent to visit the whole than part of my country struck therefore with the reflection of having never seen scotland i instantly ordered my baggage to be got ready and in a reasonable time found myself on the banks of the tweed  as soon as i communicated to you my resolution with your accustomed friendship you wished to hear from me i could give but a partial performance of my promise the attention of a traveller being so much taken up as to leave very little room for the discharge of epistolary duties and i flatter myself you will find this tardy execution of my engagement more satisfactory than the hasty accounts i could send you on my road but this is far from being the sole motive of this address  i have irresistible inducements of public and of a private nature to you i owe a most free enjoyment of the little territories providence had bestowed on me for by a liberal and equal cession of fields and meads and woods you connected all the divided parts and gave a full scope to all my improvements every view i take from my window reminds me of my debt and forbids my silence causing the pleasing glow of gratitude to diffuse itself over the whole frame instead of forcing up the imbittering sigh of oh si angulus ille now every scene i enjoy receives new charms for i mingle with the visible beauties the more pleasing idea of owing them to you the worthy neighbor and firm friend who are happy in the calm and domestic paths of life with abilities superior to oftentation and goodness content with its own reward with a sound judgment and honest heart you worthily discharge the senatorial trust reposed in you whose unprejudiced vote aids to still the madness of the people or aims to check the presumption of the minister my happiness in being from your earliest life your neighbor makes me confident in my observation your increasing and discerning band of friends discovers and confirms the justice of it may the reasons that attract and bind us to you ever remain is the most grateful wish that can be thought of by  dear sir your obliged and affectionate friend thomas pennant downing octobe  plates i eider drake and

for the singular structure of the four principal streets which are as if excavated out of the earth and sunk many feet beneath the surface the carriages drive far beneath the level of the kitchens on a line with ranges of shops over which on each side of the streets passengers walk from end to end in covered galleries secure from wet or heat the back courts of all these houses are level with the ground but to go into any of these four streets it is necessary to descend a flight of several steps  the cathedral is an ancient structure very ragged on the outside from the nature of the red friable stone saxum arenarium friabile rubrum da costa fossils i     with which it is built the tabernacle work in the choir is very neat but the beauty and elegant simplicity of a very antique gothic chapter house is what merits a visit from every traveller  the hypocaust near the feathers inn is one of the remains of the romans this city was the deva and devana of antonine and the station of the legia vicessima victrix  it being well known that this place was a principal station among many antiquities found here none is more singular than the rude sculpture of the dea armigera minerva with her bird and her altar on the face of a rock in a small field near the welsh end of the bridge  the castle is a decaying pile the walk of the city the only complete specimens of ancient fortifications are kept in excellent order being the principal walk of the inhabitants the views from the several parts are very fine the mountains of flintshire the hills of broxton and the insulated rock of beeston form the ruder part of the scenery a rich flat forms the softer view and the prospect up the river toward boughton recalls in some degree the idea of the thames and richmond hill  passed through tarvin a small village in the churchyard is an epitaph in memory of mr john thomasen an excellent penman but particularly famous for his exact and elegant imitation of the greek character  delamere which leland calls a fair and large forest with plenty of read deer and falow is now a black and dreary waste it feeds a few rabbets and a few black terns br zool ii   0 skim over the splashes that water some part of it  a few miles from this heath lies northwich salt pis a small town long famous for its rock salt and brine pits some years ago i visited one of the mines the stratum of salt lies about forty yards thick that which i saw was hollowed into the form of a temple i descended through a dome and found the roof supported by rows of pillars about two yards thick and several in height the whole was illuminated with numbers of candles and made a most magnificent and glittering appearance above the salt is a bed of whitish clay argilla caerulacinerea da costa fossils i     used in making the liverpool earthenware and in the same place is also dug a good deal of the gypsum or plaster stone the fossil salt is generally yellow and semipellucid sometimes debased with a dull greenish earth and is often found but in small quantities quite clear and colorless  the road from this place to macclesfield is through a flat rich but unpleasant country that town is in a very flourishing state is possessed of a great manufacture of mohair and twist buttons has between twenty and thirty silk mills and a very considerable copper smelting house and brass work  after leaving this place the country almost instantly changes and becomes very mountanous and barren at left on the surface but the bowels compensate for the external sterility by yielding sufficient quantity of coal for the use of the neighboring parts of cheshire and for the burning of lime vast quantity is made near buxton and being carried to all parts for the purposes of agriculture is become a considerable article of commerce  the celebrated warm bath of buxton the romans who were remarkably fond of warm baths did not overlook these agreeable waters they had a bath enclosed with a brick wall adjacent to the present st annes well which dr short in his essay on mineral waters says was razed in   0  is seated in a bottom buxton amidst these hills in a most chearless spot and would be little frequented did not hygeia often reside here and dispense to her votaries the chief blessings of life ease and health with joy and gratitude i this moment reflect on the efficacious qualities of the waters i recollect with rapture the return of spirits the flight of pain and reanimation of my long long crippled rheumatic limbs but how unfortunate is it that what providence designed for the general good should be rendered only a partial one and denied to all except the opulent or i may say to the comparatively few that can get admittance into the house where these waters are imprisoned there are other springs  cambden says nine very near that in the hall and in all probability of equal virtue i was informed that the late duke of devonshire not long before his death had ordered some of these to be enclosed and formed into baths it is to be hoped that his successor will not fail adopting so useful and humane a plan that he will form it on the most enlarged system that they may open not solely to these whom misused wealth has rendered invalids but to the poor cripple whom honest labor has made a burden to himself and his country and to the soldier and sailor who by hard service have lost the use ot those very limbs which once were active in our defense the honor resulting from such a foundation would be as great as the satisfaction arising from a consciousness of so benevolent a work would be unspeakable the charms of dissipation would then lose their force and dull and tasteless would every human luxury appear to him who had it in his power thus to lay open these fountains of health and to be able to exult in such pathetic and comfortable strains as these when the ear heard me then it blessed me and when the eye saw me it gave witness to me  because i delivered the poor that cried and the fatherless and him that had none to help him  the blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me and i caused the widows heart to sing for joy  i was eyes to the blind and feet was i to the lame  after leaving buxton passed through middleton dale a deep narrow chasm between two vast cliffs which extend on each side near a mile in length this road is very singular but the rocks in general are too naked to be beautiful at the end is the small village of stoney middleton here the prospect opens and at barsly bridge exhibits a pretty view of a small but fertile vale watered by the derwent and terminated by chatsworth and its plantations arrived and lay at  chesterfield an ugly town there is here a great manufacture of worsted stockings and another of a brown earthenware much of which is sent into holland the clay is found near the town over the bass or cherry or flinty stratum above the coal the steeple of chesterfield church is a spire covered with lead but by a violent wind strangely bent in which state it remains  in the road side about three miles from the town june    are several pits of iron stone about nine or ten feet deep the stratum lies above the coal and is two feet thick i was informed that the adventurers pay ten pounds per annum to the lord of the soil for liberty of raising it that the laborers borers have six shillings per load for getting it each load is about twenty strikes or bushels which yields a tun of metal coal in these parts is very cheap a tun and a half being sold for five shillings  changed horses at worksop and tuxford crossed the trent at dunhamferry where it is broad but shallow the spring tides flow here and rise about two feet but the common tides never reach this place pass along the fossdyke or the canal opened by henry i dugdale on embanking     to form a communication between the trent and the witham it was opened i make use of this word as doctor stukely conjectures this canal to have been originally a roman work and that another of the same kind called the cardike communicated with it by means of the withan which began a little below washenbro three miles from lincoln and was continued through the fens as far as peterborough the gentlemen who favored me with the account of the cardike referred me to stukelys cerausius and his life of richard of cirencester books i have not at present before me the year      and extends from lincoln to torkesey its length is eleven miles three quarters the breadth between dike and dike at the top is about sixty feet at bottom twentytwo vessels from fifteen to thirtyfive tuns navigate this canal and by its means a considerable trade in coals timber corn and wool is carried on in former times the persons who had landed property on either side were obliged to scower it whenever it was choked up and accordingly we find presentiments were made by juries in several succeeding reigns for that purpose reach  lincon an ancient but illbuilt city much fallen away from its former extent it lies partly on a plain partly on a very steep hill on whose summit are the cathedral and the ruins of the castle the first is a vast pile of gothic architecture has nothing remarkable on the outside but within is of matchless beauty and magnificence the ornaments are excessively rich and in the finest gothic taste the pillars light the center losty and of a surprising grandeur the windows at the n and s ends very ancient but very elegant one represents a leaf with its fibers the other consists of a number of small circles there are two other ancient windows on each side the great isle the others as i recollect are modern this church was till of late years much out of repair but has just been restored in a manner that does credit to the chapter there is indeed a sort of arch near the w end that seems placed there for the same end as bays tells us he wrote one of his scenes merely to set off the rest  the prospect from this eminence is very extensive but very barren of objects a vast flat as far as the eye can reach consisting of plains not the most fertile or of fens the fens naked as they now appear were once well wooded oaks have been found buried in them which were sixteen yards long and five in circumference fir trees from thirty to thirtyfive yards long and a foot or eighteen inches square these trees had not the mark of the ax but appeared as if burnt down by fire applied to their lower parts acorns and small nuts have also been found in great quantities in the same places dugdale on embanking     and moors the last are far less extensive than they were many being drained and will soon become the best land in the country but still much remains to be done the fens near revesbyabby eight miles beyond horncastle are of vast extent but serve for little other purpose than the rearing great numbers of geese which are the wealth of the fenmen  during the breeding season geese these birds are lodged in the same houses with the inhabitants and even in their very bedchambers in every appartment are three rows of coarse wicker pens placed one above another each bird has its separate lodge divided from the other which it keeps possession of during the time of sitting a person called a gozzard i e gooseherd  attends the flock and twice a day drives the whole to water then brings them back to their habitations helping those that live in the upper stories to their nests without ever misplacing a single bird  the geese are plucked five times in the year the first plucking is at lady day for feathers and quils and the same is renewed for feathers only four times more between that and michaelmas the old geese submit quietly to the operation but the young ones are very noisy and unruly i once saw this performed and observed that goslins of six weeks old were not spared for their tails were plucked as i was told to habituate them early to what they were to come to if the season proves cold numbers of geese die by this barbarous custom it was also practiced by the ancients candidorum alterum vecgal velluntar quibusdam loc his anno plinii lib x c      vast numbers are drove annually to london to supply the markets among them all the superannuated geese and ganders called here cagmags which serve to fatigue the jaws of the good citizens who are so unfortunate as to meet with them  the fen called the west fen fen birds is the place where the ruffs and reeves resort to in the greatest numbers br zool ii     suppl tab xv p     and many other sorts of water fowl which do not require the shelter of reeds or rushes migrate here to breed for this fen is very bare having been imperfectly drained by narrow canals which intersect it for great numbers of miles these the inhabitants navigate in most diminutive shallow boats they are in fact the roads of the country  the east fen is quite in a state of nature and gives a specimen of the country before the introduction of drainage it is a vast tract of morass intermixed with numbers of lakes from half a mile to two or three miles in circuit communicating with each other by narrow reedy straits they are very shallow none are above four or five feet in depth but abound with fish such as pike perch ruff bream tench rud dace roach burbolt sticklebacks and eels the fen is covered with reeds the harvest of the neighboring inhabitants who mow them annually for they prove a much better thatch than straw and not only cottages but many very good houses are covered with them stares which during winter resort in myriads to roost in the reeds are very destructive by breaking them down by the vast numbers that perch on them the people are therefore very diligent in their attempts to drive them away and are at great expense in powder to free themselves from these troublesome guests i have seen a stock of reeds harvested and stacked worth two or three hundred pounds which was the property of a single farmer  the birds which inhabit the different fens are verv numerous i never met with a finer field for the zoologist to range in besides the common wildduck of which an account is given in another place br zool ii     in general to avoid repetition the reader is errd to the four octavo volumes of british zoology for a more particular account of  mentioned in this tour  wild geese garganies pochards shovelers and teals breed here i have seen on the east fen a small flock of the tusted ducks but they seemed to make it only a baiting place the pewit gulls and black terns abound the last in vast flocks almost deafen one with their clamors a few of the great terns or tickets are seen among them i saw several of the great crested grebes on the east fen called there gaunts and met with one of their floating nests with eggs in it the lesser crested grobe the black and dusky grebe and the little grebe are also inhabitants of the fens together with coots waterhens spotted waterhens waterrails ruffs redshanks lapwings or wipes redbreasted godwits and whimbrels the godwits breed near weshenbrough the whimbrels only appear for about a fortnight in may near spalding and then quit the country opposite to fossdyke wash during summer are great numbers of avosettas called there yelpers from their cry they hover over the sportsmans head like the lapwing and fly with their necks and legs extended  knots are taken in nets along the shores near fossyke in great numbers during winter but they disappear in the spring  the shorteared owl br zool i     visits the neighborhood of washenbrough along with the woodcocks and probably performs its migrations with those birds for it is observed to quit the country at the same time i have also received specimens of them from the danish dominions one of the retreats of the woodcock this owl is not observed in this county to perch on trees but conceals itself in long old grass if disturbed takes a short flight lights again and keeps staring about during which time its horns are very visible the farmers are fond of the arrival of these birds as they clear the fields of mice and will even fly in search of prey during day provided the weather is cloudy and misty  but the greatest curiosity in these parts is the vast herony at cressihall heronry six miles from spalding the herons resort there in february to repair their nests settle there in the spring to breed and quit the place during winter they are numerous as rooks and their nests so crowded together that myself and the company that was with me counted not fewer than eighty in one tree i here had opportunity of detecting my own mistake and that of other ornithologists in making two species of herons for i found that the crested heron was only the male of the other it made a most beautiful appearance with its snowy neck and long crest streaming with the wind the family who owned this place was of the same name with these birds which seems to be the principal inducement for preserving them  in the time of michael drayton here stalked the stately crane at though he marched in war  but at present this bird is quite unknown in our island but every other species enumerated by that observant poet still are found in this fenny tract or its neighborhood  visited spalding june    spalding a place very much resembling in form neatness and situation a dutch town the river welland passes through one of the streets a canal is cut through another and trees are planted on each side the church is a handsome structure the steeple a spire the churches in general throughout this low tract are very handsome all are built of stone which must have been brought from places very remote along temporary canals for in many instances the quarries lie at lest twenty miles distant but these aedifices were built in zealous ages when the benedictions or maledictions of the church made the people conquer every difficulty that might obstruct these pious foundations the abbey of crowland seated in the midst of a snaking fen is a curious monument of the insuperable zeal of the times it was erected in as the beautiful tower of boston church visible from all parts is a magnificent specimen of a fine gothic taste  passed near the site of swinesheadabby june    swinesheadabby of which there are not the lest remains in the walls of a farm house built out of the ruins you are shown the figure of a knight templar and told it was the monk who poisoned king john a fact denied by our best historians  returned through lincoln went out of town under the newportgate a curious roman work passed over part of the heath changed horses at spittle and at glanfordbridge dined at the ferryhouse on the banks of the humber and after a passage of about five miles with a brisk gale landed at hull and reached that night burtonconstable the seat of mr constable in that part of yorkshire called holderness a dull flat country but excellent for producing large cattle and a good breed of horses whose prices are near doubled since the french have grown so fond of the english kind  made an excursion to hornsea a small town on the coast remarkable only for its mere a piece of water about two miles long and one broad famous for its pike and eels it is divided from the sea by a very narrow bank so is in much danger of being sometime or other lost  the cliffs on the coast of holderness are high and composed of clay which falls down in vast fragments quantity of amber is washed out of it by the tides amber which the country people pick up and fell it is found sometimes in large masses but i never saw any so pure and clear as that from the baltic it is usually of a pale yellow color within and prettily clouded the outside covered with a thin coarse coat  after riding about twentytwo miles through a flat grazing country july   reached burlingtonquay a small town close to the sea there is a design of building a pier for the protection of shipping at present there is only a large wooden quay which projects into the water from which the place takes its name from hence is a fine view of the white cliffs of flamboroughhead which extends far to the east and forms one side of the gabrantuicorum sinus portuosus of ptolomy a name derived from the british gysr on account of the number of goats found there according to the conjecture of cambden  a mile from hence is the town of burlington the body of the church is large but the steeple by some accident has been destroyed near it is a large gateway with a noble gothic arch possibly the remains of a priory of black canons founded by walter de gant in the beginning of the reign of henry i  this coast of the kingdom is very unfavourable to trees for except some woods in the neighborhood of burtonconstable there is a vast nakedness from the humber as far as the extremity of caithness with a very few exceptions which shall be noted in their proper places  went to flamboroughhead july   flamboroughhead the town is on the north side consists of about one hundred and fifty small houses entirely inhabited by fishermen few of whom as is said die in their beds but meet their fate in the element they are so conversant in put myself under the direction of william camidge ciceroni of the place who conducted me to a little creek at that time covered with fish a fleet of cobles having just put in went in one of those little boats to view the head coasting it for upwards of two miles the cliffs are of a tremendous height and amazing grandeur beneath are several vast caverns some closed at the end others are pervious formed with a natural arch giving a romantic passage to the boat different from that we entered in some places the rocks are insulated are of a pyramidal figure and soar up to a vast height the bases of most are solid but in some pierced through and arched the color of all these rocks is white from the dung of the innumerable flocks of migratory birds its birds which quite cover the face of them filling every little projection every little hole that will give them leave to rest multitudes were swimming about others swarmed in the air and almost stunned us with the variety of their croaks and screams i observed among them corvorants shags in small flocks guillemots a few black guillemots very shy and wild auks pussins kittiwakes called here petrels br zool suppl tab xxiii p     and herring gulls landed at the same place but before our return to flamborough visited robin leiths hole a vast cavern to which there is a narrow passage from the land side it suddenly rises to a great height the roof is finely arched and the bottom is for a considerable way formed in broad steps resembling a great but easy ftaircase the mouth opens to the sea and gives light to the whole  lay at hunmandby a small village above filey bay round which are some plantations that thrive tolerably well and ought to be an encouragement to gentlemen to attempt covering these naked hills  filey brig is a ledge of rocks running far into the sea and often fatal to shipping the bay is sandy and affords vast quantities of fine fish such as turbot soles etc which during summer approach the shore and are easily taken in a common sesne or draggingnet  set out for scarborough july   passed near the site of flixton a hospital founded in the time of athelstan to give shelter to travelers from the wolves that they should not be devoured by them cambden brit ii  0   so that in those days this bare tract must have been covered with wood for those ravenous animals ever inhabit large forests these hospitia are not unfrequent among the alps are either appendages to religious houses or supported by voluntary subscriptions on the spot where flixton stood is a farmhouse to this day called the spital house reach  scarborough a large town built in form of a crescent on the sides of a deep hill at one extremity are the ruins of the castle seated on a cliff of a stupendous height from whence is a very good view of the town in the castleyard is a handsome barrack for one hundred and fifty men but at present untenanted by soldiery beneath on the south side is a large stone pier another is now building which shelters the shipping belonging to the town it is a place absolutely without trade yet owns above  00 sail of ships which are hired out for freight in the late war the government had never less than  00 of them in pay  the number of inhabitants belonging to this place are above  0000 but as great part are sailors nothing like that number are resident which makes one church sufficient for those who live on shore it is large and seated almost on the top of the hill the range of buildings on the cliff commands a fine view of the castle town and shore and of innumerable shipping that are perpetually passing backward and forward on their voyages the spaw the waters are impregnated with a purgative salt  glaubers a small quantity of common salt and of steel there are two wells the ferthest from the town is more purgative and its taste more bitter the other is more chalybeate and ita taste more brisk and pungent d h lies at the foot of one of the hills s of the town this and the great convenience of seabathing occasion a vast resort of company during summer it is at that time a place of great gayety for with numbers health is the pretense but dissipation the end  the shore is a fine hard sand and during low water is the place where the company amuse themselves with riding this is also the fish market for every day the cobles or little fishing boats are drawn on shore here and lie in rows often quite laden with variety of the best fish there was a fisherman on the  th of may      brought in at one time  0 cods    lings    skates   holibuts besides a vast quantity of lesser fish and sold the whole for  l   s it is superfluous to repeat what has been before mentioned of the methods of fishing being amply described vol iii p     of the british zoology yet it will be far from impertinent to point out the peculiar advantages of these seas and the additional benefit this town might experience by the augmentation of its fisheries for this account and for numberless civilities i think myself much indebted to mr travis furgeon who communicated to me the following remarks  scarborough is situated at the bottom of a bay formed by whitby rock on the north and flamboroughhead on the south the town is seated directly opposite to the center of the w end of the dogger bank which end according to hammonds chart of the north sea lies s and by w and n and by e but by a line drawn from tinmouth castle would lead about n w and s e though the dogger bank is therefore but    leagues from flamboroughhead yet it is    and a half from scarborough    from whitby and    from tinmouth castle the n side of the bank stretches off e n e between  0 and  0 leagues until it almost joins to the longbank and jutts riff  it is to be remarked that the fishermen seldom find any cod ling or other round fish upon the dogger bank itself but on the sloping edges and hollows contiguous to it the top of the bank is covered with a barren shifting sand which affords them no subsistence and the water on it from its shallowness is continually so agitated and broken as to allow them no time to rest the flat fish do not suffer the same inconvenience there for when disturbed by the motion of the sea they shelter themselves in the sand and find variety of suitable food it is true the dutch fish upon the dogger bank but it is also true they take little except soles skates thornbacks plaise etc it is in the hollows between the dogger and the wellbank that the cod are taken which supply london market  the shore except at the entrance of scarborough pier and some few other places is composed of covered rocks which abound with lobsters and crabs and many other shell fish no oysters thence after a space covered with clean sand extending in different places from one to five or six miles the bottom all the way to the edge of the dogger banks is a scar in some places very rugged rocky and cavernous in others smooth and overgrown with variety of submarine plants mosses corallines etc i met with on the shores near scarborough small fragments of the true red coral some parts again are spread with sand and shells others for many leagues in length with soft mud and ooze furnished by the discharge of the tees and humber  upon an attentive review of the whole it may be clearly inferred that the shore along the coast on the one hand with the edges of the dogger bank on the other like the sides of a decoy give a direction toward our fishing grounds to the mighty shoals of cod and other fish which are well known to come annually from the northern ocean into our seas and secondly that the great variety of fishing grounds near scarborough extending upwards of    leagues from the shore afford secure retreats and plenty of proper food for all the various kinds of fish and also suitable places for each kind to deposit their spawn in  the fishery at scarbarough only employs  0  men and brings in about    0l per annum a trifle to what it would produce was there a canal from thence to leeds and manchester it is probable it would then produce above ten times that sum employ some thousands of men give a comfortable and cheap subsistence to our manufacturers keep the markers moderately reasonable enable our manufacturing towns to underfell our rivals and prevent the hands as is too often the case raising insurrections in every year of scarcity natural or artificial  on discoursing with some very intelligent fishermen i was informed of a very singular phoenomenon they annually observe about the spawning of fish mr osk observed the same in s lat       in his return from china the seamen call it the flowering of the water vol  l     at the distance of   or   leagues from shore during the months of july and august it is remarked that at the depth of   or   fathom from the surface the water appears to be saturated with a thick jelly filled with the ova of fish which reaches  0 or    fathoms deeper this is known by its adhering to the ropes the cobles anchor with when they are fishing for they find the first   or   fathom of rope free from spawn the next  0 or    covered with slimy matter the remainder again free to the bottom they suppose this gelatinous stuff to supply the newborn fry with food and that it is also a protection to the spawn as being disagreeable to the larger fish to swim in  there is great variety of fish brought on shore besides those described as british fish were two species of rays the whipray has also been taken here and another species of weever but these are subjects more proper to be referred to a fauna than an itinerary for a minute description  left scarborough passed over large moors to robin hoods bay july  0 on my round observed the vast mountains of alum stone alum works from which that salt is thus extracted it is first calcined in great heaps which continue burning by its own phlogiston after being well set on fire by coals for six ten or fourteen months according to the size of the heap some being equal to a small hill it is then thrown into pits and steeped in water to extract all the saline particles the liquor is then run into other pits where the vitriolic salts are precipitated by the addition of a solution of the sal sode prepared from kelp or by the volatile alkali of stale urine the superfluous water being then evaporated duly by boiling in large furnaces the liquor is set to cool and lastly is poured into large casks to crystallize  the alum works of this county are of some antiquity they were first discovered by sir thomas chaloner in the reign of queen elizabeth who observing the trees tinged with an unusual color made him suspicious of its being owing to some mineral in the neighborhood he found out that the strata abounded with an aluminous salt  at that time the english being strangers to the method of managing it there is a tradition that sir thomas was obliged to seduce some workmen from the popes alumworks near rome then the greatest in europe if one may judge from the curse which his holiness thundered out against sir thomas and the sugitives he certainly was not a little enraged for he cursed by the very form that ernulphus vide tristram shandy has left us and not varied a tittle from that most comprehensive of imprecations  the first pits were near gisborough the seat of the chaloners who still flourish there notwithstanding his holinesss anathema the works were so valuable as to be deemed a royal mine sir paul pindar who rented them paid annually to the king    00l to the earl of mulgrave    0l to sir william pennyman  00l kept  00 workmen in pay and sold his alum at   l per tun but

streaneshalch or bay of the lighthouse a large town oddly situated between two hills with a narrow channel running through the middle extending about a mile farther up the vale where it widens and forms a bay the two parts of the town are joined by a good drawbridge for the convenience of letting the shipping pass from this bridge are often taken the viviparous blenny whose backbone is as green as that of the sea needle the river that forms this harbor is the esk but its waters are very inconsiderable when the tide is out here is a pretty brisk trade in shipbuilding but except that a small manufacture of sailcloth and the hiring out of ships as at scarborough like that town it has scarce any commerce it is computed there are about   0 ships belonging to this place of late an attempt has been made to have a share in the greenland fishery four ships were sent out and had very good success there are very good dry docks toward the end of the harbor and at the mouth a most beautiful pier

northumberland about a d     possibly in consequence of a vow he made to found half a dozen monasteries and make his daughter a nun should heaven favor his arms st hilda founded a convent here for men and women dedicated it to st peter and put it under the direction of an abbess this establishment was ruined by the excursions of the danes but after the conquest it was rebuilt and filled with benedictines by walter de percy in less enlightened times it was believed that not a wild goose dared to fly over this holy ground and if it ventured was sure to fall precipitate and perish in the attempt  went about two miles along the shore then turned up into the country a black and barren moor observed on the right a vast artificial mount or tumulus called freeburgh hill a monument in all probability the work of the danes whose custom it was to fling up such tumuli over the graves of their kings or leaders or in memory of the flain in general upon the spot where they had obtained any great victory it is possible that this mount owed its rise to the victory gained by ivar a danish prince over ella king of bernicia who was on his way from the north to succor osbert for we are told that ivar after defeating the last went from york to meet ella and fought and flew him on his march  at the end of this moor about three miles from gisborough is a beautiful view over the remaining

it at right angles in the middle of the great street are neat shambles a townhouse and large assemblyroom there is besides a large square about a century ago according to anderson it had scarce a house that was not made of clay and thatch but is now a flourishing place its manufacture is sail cloth and great quantities of corn and lead from the mineral parts of the county are sent off from hence by commission as the river does not admit of large vessels so high as the town those commodities are sent down to be shipped  the salmon fishery here is neglected for none are taken beyond what is necessary to supply the country smelts come up the river in the winter time on the west side of the town stood the castle what remained of it is at present converted into a barn the country from

extensive principally along the sides or at the bottom of deep dells bounded with vast precipices finely wooded and many parts of the rocks are planted with vines which i was told bore well but late the river were winds along the hollows and forms two very fine reaches at the place where you enter these walks its waters are very clear and its bottom a solid rock the view toward the ruins of finchalabby is remarkably great and the walk beneath the cliffs has a magnificent solemnity a fit retreat for its monastic inhabitants this was once called the desert and was the rude scene of the austerities of st godric who carried them to the most senseless extravagance st godric was born at walpole in norfolk and being an itinerant merchant got acquainted with st cuthbtert at farn island he made three pilgrimages to jerusalem at length was warned by a vision to settle in the desert of finchal he lived a hermetical life there during    years and practiced unheard of austerities he wore an iron shirt next his skin day and night and wore out three he mingled ashes with the flower he made his bread of and least it should then be too good kept it three or four months before he ventured to eat it in winter as well as summer he passed whole nights up to his chin in water at his devotions like st antony he was often haunted by fiends in various shapes sometimes in form of beautiful damsels so was visited with evil concupiscence which he cured by rolling naked among thorns and briars his body grew ulcerated but to increase his pain he poured salt into the wounds wrought many miracles and died    0 britannia sacra  0  about ten years after his decease a benedictine priory of thirteen monks was founded there in his honor by hugh pudsey bishop of durham  a sober mind may

bottom  passed through chesterlestreet a small town near which is lumlycastle the seat of the earl of scarborough a place as i was told very well worth seeing but unfortunately it proved a public day and i lost sight of it the country from durham to newcastle was very beautiful the risings gentle and prettily wooded and the views agreeable that on the borders remarkably fine there being from an eminence not far from the capital of northumberland an extensive view of a rich country watered by the coaly tyne reach  newcastle a large disagreeable and dirty town newcastle divided in two unequal parts by the river and both sides very steep the lower parts are inhabited by keelmen and their families a mutinous race for which reason this town is always garrisoned  the great business of the place is the coal trade the collieries lie at different distances from five to eighteen miles from the river and the coal is brought down in wagons along rail roads and discharged from covered buildings at the edge of the water into the keels or boats that are to convey it on shipboard these boats are strong clumsy and round will carry about    tuns each sometimes are navigated with a square sail but generally are pushed along with large poles no ships of large burden can come up as high as newcastle but are obliged to lie at shields a few miles down the river where stage coaches go thrice every day for the convenience of passengers this country is most remarkably populous newcastle alone contains near  0000 inhabitants and there are at lest  00 sail of ships belonging to that town and its port the effect of the vast commerce of this place is very apparent for many miles round the country is finely cultivated and bears a most thriving and opulent aspect  july    left newcastle the country in general flat passed by a large stone column with three dials on the capital with several scripture texts on the sides called here piggs folly from the founder  a few miles further is stannington bridge a pleasant village morpeth a small town with a neat townhouse and a tower for the bell near it the castle was on a small eminence but the remains are now very inconsiderable some attempt was made a few years ago to introduce the manchester manufacture but without success there is a remarkable story of this place that the inhabitants reduced their own town to ashes on the approach of king john a d      out of pure hatred to their monarch in order that he might not find any shelter there  this place gave birth to william turner as dr fuller expresses it an excellent latinist grecian orator and poet he might have added polemic divine champion and sufferer in the protestant cause physician and naturalist his botanic writings are among the first we had and certainly the best of them and his criticisms on the birds of aristotle and pliny are very judicious he was the first who flung any light on those subjects in our island therefore clames from a naturalist this tribute to his memory he was born in the reign of henry viii died in        felton a pleasant village on the coquet which some few miles lower discharges itself into the sea opposite to a small isle of the same name remarkable for the multitudes of waterfowl which resort there to breed  at alnwick alnwick castle a small town the traveller is disappointed with the situation and environs of the castle the residence of the percies the ancient earls of northumberland you look in vain for any marks of the grandeur of the feudal age for trophies won by a family eminent in our annals for military prowess and deeds of chivalry for halls hung with helms and haberks or with the spoils of the chase for extensive forests and venerable oaks you look in vain for the helmet on the tower the ancient signal of hospitality to the traveller or for the greyheaded porter to conduct him to the hall of entertainment the numerous train whose countenances gave welcome to him on his way are now no more and instead of the disinterested usher of the old times he is attended by a valet eager to receive the fees of admittance  there is vast grandeur in the appearance of the outside of the castle the towers magnificent but injured by the numbers of rude statues crowded on the battlements the appartments are large and lately finished in the gothic style with a most incompatible elegance the gardens are equally inconsistent trim to the highest degree and more adapted to a villa near london than the ancient seat of a great baron in a word nothing except the numbers of unindustrious poor that swarm at the gate excites any one idea of its former circumstances  a stage further is belford the seat of abraham dixon esquire a modern house the front has a most beautiful simplicity in it the grounds improved as far as the art of husbandry can reach the plantations large and flourishing a new and neat town instead of the former wretched cottages and an industrious race instead of an idle poor at present fill the estate  on an eminence on the sea coast bamborough castle about four miles from belford is the very ancient castle of bamborough built by ida first king of the northumbrians a d     but according to the conjecture of an antiquarian i met with there on the site of a roman fortress it was also his opinion that the square tower was actually the work of the romans it had been of great strength the hill it is founded on excessively steep on all sides and accessible only by flights of steps on the south east the ruins are still considerable the remains of a great hall are very singular it had been warmed by two fireplaces of a vast size and from the top of every window ran a flue like that of a chimney which reached the summits of the battlements many of the ruins are now filled with sand caught up by the winds that rage here with great impetuosity and carried to very distant places  this castle and the manor belonging to it was once the property of the forsters but purchased by lord crew bishop of durham bishop crews charity and with other considerable estates left vested in trustees to be applied to unconfined charitable uses three of these trustees are a majority one of them makes this place his residence and blesses the coast by his judicious and humane application of the prelates generous bequest he has repaired and rendered habitable the great square tower the part reserved for himself and family is a large hall and a few smaller apartments but the rest of the spacious edifice is allotted for purposes which make the heart to glow with joy when thought of the upper part is an ample grainary from whence corn is dispensed to the poor without distinction even in the dearest time at the rate of four shillings a bushel and the distressed for many miles round often experience the convenience of this benefaction  other apartments are fitted up for the reception of shipwrecked sailors and bedding is provided for about thirty should such a number happen to be cast on shore at the same time a constant patrole is kept every stormy night along this tempestuous coast for above eight miles the length of the manor by which means numbers of lives have been preserved many poor wretches are often found on the shore in a state of insensibility but by timely relief are soon brought to themselves  it often happens that ships strike in such a manner on the rocks as to be capable of relief in case numbers of people could be suddenly assembled for that purpose a cannon once belonging to a dutch frigate of  0 guns which with all the crew was lost opposite to the castle about sixty years ago is fixed on the top of the tower which is fired once if the accident happens in such a quarter twice if in another and thrice if in such a place by these signals the country people are directed to the spot they are to fly to and by this means frequently preserve not only the crew but even the vessel for machines of different kinds are always in readiness to heave ships out of their perilous situation  in a word all the schemes of this worthy trustee have a humane and useful tendency he seemed as if selected from his brethren for the same purposes as spenser tells us the first of his seven beadsmen in the house of holiness was  the first of them that eldest was and best of all the house had charge and government as guardian and steward of the rest his office was to give entertainment and lodging unto all that came and went not unto such as could him feast again and doubly quite for that he on them spent but such as want of harbor did constrain those for gods sake his dewty was to entertain opposite to bamborough lie the farn islands farn isles which form two groupes of little isles and rocks to the number of seventeen but at low water the points of others appear above the surface they all are distinguished by particular names the nearest isle to the shore is that called the house island which lies exactly one mile    chains from the coast the most distant is about seven or eight miles they are rented for   l per annum their produce is kelp some few feathers and a few seals which the tenant watches and shoots for the sake of the oil and skins some of them yield a eider drake and duck little grass and serve to feed a cow or two which the people are desperate enough to transport over in their little

fowlers pass from one to the other of these columns by means of a narrow board which they place from top to top forming a narrow bridge over such a horrid gap that the very fight of it strikes one with horror  landed at a small island where we found the female eider ducks vide br zool ii     i have been informed that they also breed on inchcolm in the firth of forth at that time sitting eider ducks the lower part of their nests was made of sea plants the upper part was formed of the down which they pull off their own breasts in which the eggs were surrounded and warmly bedded in some were three in others five eggs of a large size and pale olive color as smooth and glossy as if varnished over the nests are built on the beach among the loose pebbles not far from the water the ducks sit very close nor will they rise till you almost tread on them the drakes separate themselves from the females during the breeding season we robbed a few of their nests of the down and after carefully separating it from the tang found that the down of one nest weighed only three quarters of an ounce but was so elastic as to fill the crown of the largest hat the people of this country call these st cuthberts ducks from the saint of the islands  besides these birds i observed the following  puffins called here tom noddies auks here skouts guillemots black guillemot little auks shielducks shags corvorants black and white gulls brown and white gulls herring gulls which i was told fed sometimes on eggs of other birds common gull here annets kittiwakes or tarrocks pewit gulls great terns sea pies sea larks here brokets jackdaws which breed in rabbetholes rock pigeons rock larks the terns were so numerous that in some places it was difficult to tread without crushing some of the eggs  the last isle i visited was the house island the sequestered spot where st cuthbert passed the two last years of his life here was afterward established a priory of benedictines for six or eight monks subordinate to durham a square tower the remains of a church and some other buildings are to be seen there still and a stone coffin which it is pretended was that of st cuthbert at the north end of the isle is a deep chasm from the top to the bottom of the rock communicating to the sea through which in tempestuous weather the water is forced with vast violence and noise and forms a fine jet deau

bramblings or snowflakes appear the most southern place of their migration in large companies  the country almost woodless there being but one wood of any consequence between belford and berwick saw on the left an ancient tower which showed the character of the times when it was unhappily necessary on these borders for every house to be a fortress  on the right had a view of the sea and not remote from the land of lindesfarn or holy island once an episcopal seat afterward translated to durham on it are the ruins of a castle and a church in some parts are abundance of entrochi which are called by the country people st cuthberts beads  after a few miles riding have a full view of berwick and the river tweed winding westward for a considerable way up the country but its banks were without any particular charms i was informed that the beautiful banks of the tweed verify the old fong at the passage at colstream  being almost woodless the river is broad and has over it a bridge of sixteen very handsome arches eipecially two next the town  berwick is fortified in the modern way but is much contracted in its extent to what it was formerly the old castle and works now lying at some distance beyond the present ramparts the barracks are large consist of a center and two wings the church was built by cromwell and according to the spirit of the builder without a steeple even in northumberland toward the borders the steeples grew less and less and as if it were forewarned the traveller that he was speedily to take leave of episcopacy the townhouse has a large and handsome modern tower to it the streets in general are narrow and bad except that in which the townhouse stands  abundance of wool is exported from this town eggs in vast abundance collected through all the country almost as far as carlisle they are packed in boxes with the thick end downwards and are sent to london for the use of sugar refiners i was told that as many are exported as bring in annually the sum of fourteen thousand pounds  the salmon fisheries here are very considerable salmon fishery and likewise bring in vast sums they lie on each side the river and are all private property except what belongs to the dean and chapter of durham which in rent and tithe of fish brings in   0l per ann for all the other fisheries are liable to tithe the common rents of those are  0l a year for which the tenants have as much shore as serves to launch out and draw their nets on shore the limits of each are staked and i observed that the fishers never failed going as near as possible to their neighbors limits one man goes off in a small flatbottomed boat square at one end and taking as large a circuit as his net admits brings it on shore at the extremity of his boundary where others assist in landing it the best fishery is on the south side for a fuller account of this fishery vide british zoology iii   l to it may be also added that in the middle of the river not a mile west of the town is a large stone on which a man is placed to observe what is called the reck of the salmon coming up  very fine salmon trout are often taken here which come up to spawn from the sea and return in the same manner as the salmon do the chief import is timber from norway and the baltic  almost immediately on leaving berwick enter in the shire of merch or mers boethius says that in his time

neglected for till the accession of james vi and even long after the national enmity was kept up and the borderers of both countries discouraged from improvement by the barbarous inroads of each nation this inattention to agriculture continued till lately but on reaching the small village of eytown the scene was greatly altered the wretched cottages or rather hovels of the country were vanishing good comfortable houses arise in their stead the lands are enclosing and yield very good barley oats and clover the banks are planting i speak in the present tense for there is still a mixture of the old negligence left amidst the recent improvements which look like the works of a new colony in a wretched impoverished country  soon after the country relapses no arable land is seen

in scotland there are some ships sent annually from this place to greenland and the exports of corn are pretty considerable the harbor is safe but small its entrance narrow and bounded by two rocks between the harbor and the castle is a very surprising stratum of stone columnar rocks in some respects resembling that of giants causeway in ireland it consists of great columns of a red grit stone either triangular quadrangular pentangular or hexangular their diameter from one to two feet their length at low water thirty dipping or inclining a little to the south  they are jointed but not so regularly or so plainly as those that form the giants causeway the surface of several that had been torn off appear as a pavement of numbers of unequal ends probably answering to the concave bottoms of other joints once incumbent on them the space between the columns was filled with thin septa of red and white fparry matter and veins of the same pervaded the columns transversely this range of columns faces the north with a point to the east and extends in front about two hundred yards the breadth is inconsiderable the rest of the rock degenerates into shapeless masses of the same fort of stone irregularly divided by thick septa this rock is called by the people of dunbar the isle  opposite are the ruins of the castle seated on a rock above the sea underneath one part is a vast cavern composed of a black and red stone which gives it a most infernal appearance a fit representation of the pit of acheron and wanted only to be peopled with witches to make the scene complete it appears to have been the dungeon there being a formed passage from above where the poor prisoners might have been let down according to the barbarous custom of war in early days there are in some parts where the rock did not close the remains of walls for the openings are only natural fissures but the founders of the castle taking advantage of this cavity adding a little art to it rendered it a most complete and secure prison  on the other side are two natural arches through which the tide flowed under one was a fragment of wall where there seems to have been a portal for the admission of men or provisions from sea through which it is probable that alexander ramsay in a stormy night reinforced the garrison in spite of the fleet which lay before the place when closely besieged by the english

facing the little village of castleton where i took boat in order to visit this singular spot but the weather proved unfavorable the wind blew so fresh and the waves ran so high that it was impossible to attempt landing for even in calmer weather it cannot be done without hazard there being a steep rock to ascend and commonly a great swell which often removes the boat while you are scaling the precipice so in case of a false step there is the chance of falling into a water almost unfathomable  various sorts of water fowl repair annually to this rock to breed but none in greater numbers than

getting as near as possible to the protection of the castle the houses were crowded together and i may say piled one upon another merely on the principle of security  the castle is ancient but strong castle placed on the summit of the hill at the edge of a very deep precipice strangers are shown a very small room in which mary queen of scots was delivered of james vi  from this fortress is a full view of the city and its environs a strange prospect of rich country with vast rocks and mountains intermixed on the south and east are the meadows or the public walks harriots hospital part of the town overshadowed by the stupendous rocks of arthurs seat and salusbury craigs the pentland hills at a few miles distance and at a still greater those of muirfoot whose sides are covered with verdant turf  to the north is a full view of the firth of forth from queensferry to its mouth with its southern banks covered with towns and villages on the whole the prospect is singular various and fine  reservoir the reservoir of water it is conveyed in pipes from the pentland hills five miles distant for supplying the city lies in the castlestreet and is well worth seeing the great cistern contains near two hundred and thirty tuns of water which is conveyed to the several conduits that are disposed at proper distances in the principal streets these are conveniences that few towns in north britain are without  in a small square on the south side of high street is the parliament close a small square in which is the parlementhouse advocates library where the courts of justice are held below stairs is the advocates library founded by sir george mackenzie and now contains above thirty thousand volumes and several manuscripts among the more curious are the four evangelists very legible notwithstanding it is said to be several hundred years old  st jeromes bible wrote about the year   00  a malabar book wrote on leaves of plants  a turkish manuscript illuminated in some parts like a missal elogium in sultan morad filium filii soliman turcici script constantinopoli anno hegirae      a cartulary or records of the monasteries some very ancient  a very large bible bound in four volumes illustrated with scripture prints by the first engravers pasted in and collected at a vast expense there are besides great numbers of antiquities not commonly shown except enquired after  the luckenbooth row which contains the tolbooth or city prison and the weighinghouse which brings in a revenue of  00l per annum stands in the middle of the high street and with the guardhouse contributes to spoil as fine a street as most in europe being in some parts eighty feet wide and finely built  the exchange is a handsome modern building in which is the customhouse the first is of no use in its proper character for the merchants always choose standing in the open street exposed to all kinds of weather  the old cathedral is now called the new church and is divided into four places of worship in one the lords of the sessions attend there is also a throne and a canopy for his majesty should he visit this capital and another for the lord commissioner there is no music either in this or any other of the scotch churches for peg still faints at the found of an organ  the same church has a large tower oddly terminated with a sort of crown  on the front of a house in the nether bow are two fine profile heads of a man and woman roman heads of roman sculpture supposed to be those of severus and julia but as appears from an inscription in sudore vultus tui versceris pane anno      these heads are well engraven in gordons itinerary tab iii made by the person who put them into the wall were mistaken for adam and eve  near the trone church are the remains of the house once inhabited by mary steuart now a tavern  at the end of the cannongatestreet stands holyrood palace holyroad house originally an abbey founded by david i in      the towers on the n w side were erected by james v together with other buildings for a royal residence according to the editor of cambden great part except the towers abovementioned were burnt by cromwell but the other towers with the rest of this magnificent palace as it now stands were executed by sir william bruce by the directions of charles ii within is a beautiful square with piazzas on every side it contains great numbers of fine apartments some that are called the kings are in great disorder the rest are granted to several of the nobility  in the earl of breadalbanes are some excellent portraits particularly three full lengths remarkably fine by vandyck of  henry earl of holland william duke of newcastle charles earl of warwick i am informed that the portraits of the earls of holland and warwick are now removed to taymouth  and by sir peter lely the duke and duchess of lauderdale and edward earl of jersey there is besides a very good head of a boy by morrillio and some views of the fine scenes near his lordships seat at taymouth  at lord dunmores lodgings is a very large piece of charles i and his queen going to ride with the sky showering roses on them a black holds a gray horse a boy a spaniel with several other dogs sporting round the queen is painted with a lovelock and with browner hair and complexion and younger than i ever saw her drawn it is a good piece and said to be done by vandyck in the same place are two other good portraits of charles ii and james vii  the gallery of this palace takes up one side and is filled with colossal portraits of the kings of scotland  in the old towers are showen the appartments where the murder of david rizzo was committed  that beautiful piece of gothic architecture the church chapel or chapel of holyroodabby is now a ruin the roof having fell in by a most scandalous neglect notwithstanding money had been granted by government to preserve it entire beneath the ruins lie the bodies of james ii and james v henry darnly and several persons of rank and the inscriptions on several of their tombs are preserved by maitland a gentleman informed me that some years ago he had seen the remains of the bodies but in a very decayed state the beards remained on some and that the bones of henry darnly proved their owner by their great size for he was said to be seven feet high  parks near this palace are the parks first enclosed by james v within are the vast rocks according to maitland their perpendicular height is     feet known by the names of arthurs seat and salusburys craigs their fronts exhibit a romantic and wild scene of broken rocks and vast precipices which from some points seem to overhang the lower parts of the city great columns of stone from forty to fifty feet in length and about two feet in diameter regularly pentagonal or hexagonal hang down the face of some of these rocks almost perpendicularly or with a very slight dip and form a strange appearance considerable quantities of stone from the quarries have been cut and sent to london for paving the streets its great hardness rendering it excellent for that purpose beneath these hills are some of the most beautiful walks about edinburgh commanding a fine prospect over several parts of the country  on one side of the park are the ruins of st anthonys chapel once the resort of numberless votaries  the south part of the city has several things worth visiting herriots hospital herriots hospital is a fine old building much too magnificent for the end proposed that of educating poor children it was founded by george herriot jeweller to james ii who followed that monarch to london and made a large fortune there is a fine view of the castle and the sloping part of the city from the front the gardens were formerly the resort of the gay and there the scotch poets often laid in their comedies the scenes of intrigue  in the churchyard of the gray friars is the monument of sir george mackensie a rotunda with a multitude of other tombs this and another near the cannongate being the only caemeteries to this populous city  the college is a mean building but no one resides in it except the principal college whose house is supposed to be on the site of that in which george darnly was murdered then belonging to the provost of the kirk of field the students of the university are dispersed over the town and are about six hundred in number they wear no habit nor are they subject to any regulations but as they are for the most part volunteers for knowledge few of them desert her standards there are twentytwo professors of different sciences most of whom read lectures all the chairs are very ably filled those in particular which relate to the study of medicine as is evident from the number of ingenious physicians eleves of this university who prove the abilities of their masters the musaeum had for many years been neglected but by the assiduity of the present professor of natural history bids fair to become a most instructive repository of the naturalia of these kingdoms  the royal infirmary is a spacious and handsome aedifice infirmary capable of containing two hundred patients the operationroom is particularly convenient the councilroom elegant with a good picture in it of provost drummond from the cupolo of this building is a fine prospect and a full view of the city  not far from hence are twentyseven acres of ground designed for a square called george square a small portion is at present built consisting of small but commodious houses in the english fashion such is the spirit of emprovement that within these three years sixty thousand pounds have been expended in houses in the modern taste and twenty thousand in the old  watsons hospital should not be forgot a large good building behind the gray friars church an excellent institution for the educating and apprenticing the children of decayed merchants who after having served their time with credit receive fifty pounds to set up with  the meadows or public walks are well planted and are very extensive these are the mall of edinburgh as comely gardens are its vauxhall  the cowgate is a long street running parallel with the high street beneath the steep southern declivity of the city and terminates in the grassmarket a wide street where cattle are sold and criminals executed on several of the houses are small iron crosses which i was informed denoted that they once belonged to the knights of st john  on the north side of the city lies the new town which is planned with great judgment and will prove a magnificent addition to edinburgh the houses in st andrews square cost from   00l to  000l each and one or two  000 or  000l they are all built in the modern style and are free from the inconveniences attending the old city  these improvements are connected to the city by a very beautiful bridge whose highest arch is ninetyfive feet high  in the walk of this evening i passed by a deep and wide hollow beneath calton hill the place where those imaginary criminals witches and forcerers in less enlightened times were burnt and where at festive seasons the gay and galant held their tilts and tournaments at one of these it is said that the earl of bothwell made the first impression on the susceptible heart of mary stuart having galopped into the ring down the dangerous steeps of the adjacent hill he seemed to think that  women born to be controlled stoop to the forward and the bold these desperate feats were the humor of the times of chivalry brantome relates that the ducde nemours galopped down the steps of the saint chapel at paris to the astonishment of the beholders the men cultivated every exercise that could preserve or improve their bodily strength the ladies every art that tended to improve their charms mary is reported to have used a bath of white wine a custom strange but not without precedent jaques du fouilloux enraptured with a country girl enumerating the arts which she scorned to use to improve her person mentions this  point ne portoit de ce linge semelle pour amoindrir son seeing et sa mammelle vasquine nulle ou aucun pelicon elle ne

lies the new botanic garden the old botanic garden lies to the east of the new bridge an account of it is to be seen in the museum balfourianum  consisting of five acres of ground a greenhouse fifty feet long two temperate rooms each twelve feet and two stoves each twentyeight the ground rises to the north and defends the plants from the cold winds the soil a light sand with a black earth on the surface it is finely stocked with plants whose arrangement and cultivation do much credit to my worthy friend dr hope professor of botany who planned and executed the whole it was begun in      being founded by the munificence of his present majesty who granted fifteen hundred pounds for that purpose  during this weeks stay at edinburgh the prices of provisions were as follow  beef from  d to  d

is a flourishing place and the port of edinburgh the town is dirty and ill built and chiefly inhabited by sailors but the pier is very fine and is a muchfrequented walk the races were at this time on the sands near low water mark considering their vicinity to a great city and populous country the meeting was far from numerous a proof that dissipation has not generally infected the manners of the north britons  craigmellar castle is seated on a rocky eminence about two miles south of edinburgh is square and has towers at each corner some few apartments are yet inhabited but the rest of this great pile is in ruins  newbottle the seat of the marquess of lothian is a pleasant ride of a few miles from the capital it was once a cistercian abbey founded by david i in    0 but in      was erected into a lordship in favor of sir mark ker son of sir walter ker of cessford the house lies in a warm bottom and like most other of the houses of the scotch nobility resembles a french chateau by having a village or little paltry town adjacent the situation is very favorable to trees as appears by the vast size of those near the house and i was informed that fruit ripens here within ten days as early as at chelsea  the marquess possesses a most valuable collection of portraits many of them very fine and almost all very instructive a large halflength of henry darnly represents him tall awkward and gauky with a stupid insipid countenance most likely drawn after he had lost by intemperance and debauchery those charms which captivated the heart of the amorous mary  a head of her

hawthornden the residence of the celebrated poet drummond who is said to have composed his poems in one of these caves he flourished in the time of james vi are as i was informed others of the same nature but of greater extent which doctor stukeley vide itin curiosum  0 tab    calls a pictish castle these places in fact were excavated by the ancient inhabitants of the country either as receptacles for their provisions or for retreats for themselves or families in time of war in the same manner as tacitus relates was the custom of the germans solent et subterraneos specus aperire

appeared to great advantage the country i past through was well cultivated the fields large but mostly enclosed with stone walls for hedges are not yet become universal in this part of the kingdom it is not a century since they were known here reach the  southferry a small village on the banks of the firth which suddenly is contracted to the breadth of two miles by the jutting out of the land on both shores but almost instantly widens toward the west into a fine and extensive bay the prospect on each side is very beautiful a rich country frequently diversified with towns villages castles and gentlemens seats such as seith castle dumferline town lord morriss lord hopetouns captain dundasss  there is beside a vast view up and down the firth from its extremity not remote from sterling to its mouth near mey isle in all about sixty miles  this ferry is also called queensferry being the passage much used or as others say because she her brother and sister first landed there after their escape from william the conqueror by margaret queen to malcom iii and sister to edgar etheling her residence being at dumferline cross over in an excellent passageboat observe midway the little isle called inchgarvey with the ruin of a small castle an arctic gull flew near the boat pursued by other gulls as birds of prey are this is the species that persecutes and pursues the lesser kinds till they mute through fear when it catches up their excrements ever they reach the water the boatmen on that account styled it the dirty aulin  landed in the shire of fife part of the ancient caledonia  at north ferry granite quarry near which are the great granite quarries which help to supply the streets of london with paving stones many ships then waiting near in order to take in their lading the granite lies in great perpendicular stacks above which a reddish earth filled with friable micaceous nodules the granite itself is very hard and is all blasted with gunpowder the cutting into shape for paving costs two shillings and eightpence per tun and the freight to london seven shillings  the country as far as kinross is very fine consisting of gentle risings much corn especially bear but few trees except about a gentlemans seat called blair where there are great and flourishing plantations near the road are the last collieries in scotland except the inconsiderable works in the county of sutherland  kinross is a small town seated in a large plain bounded by mountains the houses and trees are so intermixed as to give it an agreeable appearance it has some manufactures of linen and cutlery ware at this time was a meeting of justices on a singular occasion a vagrant had been not long before ordered to be whipped but such was the point of honor among the common people that no one could be persuaded to go to perth for the executioner who lived there to press i may say two men for that service was the cause of the meeting so mr boswell hist corsica may rejoice to find the notion of honor prevale in as exalted a degree among his own countrymen as among the virtuous corsicans  not far from the town is the house of kinross built by the famous architect sir william bruce for his own residence and was the first good house in north britain it is a large elegant but plain building the hall is fiftytwo feet long the grounds about it well planted the fine lake adjacent so that it is capable of being made as delightful a place as any in north britain  loughleven a magnificent piece of water very broad but irregularly indented is about twelve miles in circumference and its greatest depth about twentyfour fathoms is finely bounded by mountains on one side on the other by the plain of kinross and prettily embellished with several groves most fortunately disposed some islands are dispersed in this great expanse of water one of which is large enough to feed several head of cattle but the most remarkable is that distinguished by the captivity of mary stuart lochleven castle which stands almost in the middle of the lake the castle still remains consists of a square tower a small yard with two round towers a chapel and the ruins of a building where it is said the unfortunate princess was lodged in the square tower is a dungeon with a vaulted room above over which had been three other stories some trees are yet remaining on this little spot probably coeval with mary under whose shade she may have sat expecting her escape at length effected by the enamoured douglas historians differ in respect to the cause that influenced him to assist in his sovereigns escape some attribute it to his avarice and think he was bribed with jewels reserved by mary others that he was touched by a more generous passion the last opinion is the most natural considering the charms of the queen and the youth of her deliverer  this castle had before been a royal residence but not for captive monarchs having been granted from the crown by robert iii to douglas lord of lochleven but had been originally a seat of the culdees  the fish of this lake are pike small perch fine eels fish and birds and most excellent trouts the best and the reddest i ever saw the largest about six pounds in weight the fishermen gave me an account of a species they called the gally trout which are only caught from october to january are split salted and dried for winter provision by the description they certainly were our char only of a larger size than any we have in england or wales some being two feet and a half long the birds that breed on the isles are herring gulls pewit gulls and great terns called here pictarnes  lay at a good inn a single house about half a mile north of kinross  made an excursion about seven miles west july    rumbling brig to see the rumbling brig at glendevon a bridge of one arch slung over a chasm worn by the river devon about eighty feet deep very narrow and horrible to look down the bottom in many parts is covered with fragments of rocks in others the waters are visible gushing between the stones with great violence the sides in many places project and almost lock in each other trees shoot out in various spots and contribute to increase the gloom of the glen while the ear is filled with the cawing of daws the cooing of woodpigeons and the impetuous noise of the waters  a mile lower down is the cawdron glen here the river cawdron glen after a short fall drops on rocks hollowed in a strange manner into large and deep cylindric cavities open on one side or formed into great circular cavities like cauldrons in sweden and the north of germany such holes as these are called giants pots kalms voy i     and ph trans abridg v      from whence the name of the place one in particular has the appearance of a vast brewing vessel and the water by its great agitation has acquired a yellow scum exactly resembling the yesty working of malt liquor just beneath this the water darts down about thirty feet in form of a great white sheet the rocks below widen considerably and their clifty sides are fringed with wood beyond is a view of a fine meadowy vale and the distant mountains near sterling  two miles north is castle campbell castle campbell seated on a steep peninsulated rock between vast mountains having to the south a boundless view through a deep glen shagged with brush wood for the forests that once covered the country are now entirely destroyed formerly from its darksome situation this pile was called the castle of gloom and all the names of the adjacent places were suitable it was seated in the parish of dolor was bounded by the glens of care and washed by the birns of sorrow this castle with the whole territory belonging to the family of argyle underwent all the calamities of civil war in      for its rival the marquis of montrose carried fire and sword through the whole estate the castle was ruined and its magnificent relics exist as a monument of the horror of the times no wonder then that the marquis experienced so woeful and ignominious a fate when he fell into the power of so exasperated a chieftain  returned to my inn along the foot of the ochil hills whose sides were covered with a fine verdure and fed great numbers of cattle and sheep the country below full of oats and in a very improving state the houses of the common people decent but mostly covered with sods some were covered both with straw and sod the inhabitants extremely civil and never failed offering brandy or whey when i stopped to make enquiries at any of their houses  in the afternoon crossed a branch of the same hills which yielded plenty of oats descended into straithearn a beautiful vale about thirty miles in length straithearn full of rich meadows and corn fields divided by the river earn which serpentines finely through the middle falling into the tay of which there is a fight at the east end of the vale it is prettily diversified with groves of trees and gentlemens houses among which toward the west end is castle drummond the forfeited seat of the earl of perth  castle duplin near this place was the battle of duplin      between the english under the command of baliol and the scots the last were defeated and such a number of the name of hay slain that the family would have been extinct had not several of their wives been left at home pregnant  the residence of the earl of kinnouly seated on the north side of the vale on the edge of a steep glen only a single tower remains of the old castle the rest being modernized the front commands a pleasing view of the vale behind are plantations extending several miles in length all flourish greatly except those of ash i remarked in the woods some very large chestnuts horsechesnuts spruce and silver firs cedar and arbor vitae broadleaved laburnum thrives in this country greatly grows to a great size and the wood is used in sineering  fruits succeed here very indifferently fruit even nonpareils require a wall to ripen grapes figs and late peaches will not ripen the winters begin early and end late and are attended with very high winds i was informed that labor is dear here labor notwithstanding it is only eightpence a day the common people not being yet got into a method of working so do very little for their wages notwithstanding this improvements are carried on in these parts with great spirit both in planting and in agriculture lord kinnoul planted last year not sewer than eighty thousand trees besides scotch firs so provides future forests for the benefit of his successors and the embellishment of his country in respect to agriculture there are difficulties to struggle with for the country is without either coal or limestone so that the lime is brought from the estate of the

stormont hills and the hill of kinnoul whose vast cliff is remarkable for its beautiful pebbles the maeanders of the ern which winds more than any river i at this time had seen are most enlivening additions to the scene the last turn it takes forms a fine peninsula prettily planted and just beyond it joins the tay whose aestuary lies full in view the sea closing the prospect on this side  to the north lies the town of perth with a view of part of its magnificent bridge which with the fine woods called perth parks the vast plain of straithtay the winding of that noble river its islands and the grand boundary formed by the distant highlands finish this matchless scene the inhabitants of perth are far from being blind to the beauties of their river for with singular pleasure they relate the tradition of the roman army when it came in fight of the tay taus taciti vit agr  bursting into the exclamation of ecce tiberim  on approaching the town are some pretty walks handsomely planted and at a small distance the remains of some works of cromwell called olivers mount  perth is large and in general well built perth two of the streets are remarkably fine in some of the lesser are yet a few wooden houses in the old style but as they decay the magistrates prohibit the rebuilding them in the old way there is but one parish which has two churches besides meetings for separatists who are very numerous one church which belonged to a monastery is very ancient not a vestige of the last is now to be seen for the disciples of that rough apostle knox made a general desolation of every aedifice that had given shelter to the worshippers of the church of rome it being one of his maxims to pull down the nests and the rooks would fly away  the flourishing state of perth is owing to two accidents the first that of numbers of cromwells wounded officers and soldiers choosing to reside here after he left the kingdom who introduced a spirit of industry among the people the other cause was the long continuance of the earl of mars army here in      which occasioned vast sums of money being spent in the place but this town as well as all scotland dates its prosperity from the year      the government of this part of great britain having never been settled till a little after that time the rebellion was a disorder violent in its operation but salutary in its effects  the trade of perth is considerable trade it exports annually one hundred and fifty thousand pounds worth of linen ten thousand of wheat and barley and about the same in cured salmon that fish is taken there in vast abundance three thousand have been caught in one morning weighing one with another sixteen pounds the whole capture fortyeight thousand pounds the fishery begins at st andrews day and ends august   th old style the rents of the fisheries amount to three thousand pounds per annum  i was informed that smelts come up this river in may and june  there has been in these parts a very great fishery of pearl got out of the fresh water muscles from the year      to      pearl  0000l worth were sent to london and sold from  0s to  l   s per ounce i was told that a pearl has been taken there that weighed    grains but this fishery is at present exhausted from the avarice of the undertakers it once extended as far as loughtay  gowrie house is shown to all strangers formerly the property and residence of the earl of gowrie whose tragical end and mysterious conspiracy if conspiracy there was are still fresh in the minds of the people of perth at present the house is occupied by some companies of artillery i was shown the staircase where the unhappy nobleman was killed gowrie conspiracy the window the frighted monarch james roared out of and that he escaped through when he was saved from the fury of the populace by baily roy a friend of gowries who was extremely beloved in the town  from the little traditions preserved in the palace it seems as if gowrie had not the left intent of murdering the king on the day his majesty came to perth the earl was engaged to a weddingdinner with the dean of guild when the account of the kings design reached him he changed color on being taken so unprovided but the dean forced him to accept the nuptial feast which was sent over to the earls house  when the king fled he passed by the seat of sir william moncrief near ernbridge who happening to be walking out at that time heard from the mouth of his intrepid majesty the whole relation but the knight found it so mavelous and so disjointed as plainly to tell the king that if it was a true story it was a very strange one  gowrie was a most accomplished gentleman after he had finished his studies he held the professor of philosophys chair for two years in one of the italian universities  cross the tay on a temporary bridge the stone bridge which is to consist of nine arches being at this time unfinished the largest arch is seventysix feet wide when complete it promises to be a most magnificent structure the river here is very violent and admits of scarce any navigation above but ships of eighty or ninety tuns come as far as the town  scone lies about a mile and half higher up scone on the east bank of the river there was once here an abbey of great antiquity founded by alexander i      for canons regular of st augustine  which was burnt by the reforming zealots of dundee the present palace was begun by earl gowrie but on his death being granted by james vi to his favorite sir david murray of gospatrie was completed by him who in gratitude to the king has in several parts of the house put up the royal arms the house is built round two courts the dining room is large and handsome has an ancient but magnificent chimneypiece the kings arms with this motto nobis haec invicta miserunt centum sex proavi  beneath are the murray arms in the drawingroom is some good old tapestry with an excellent figure of mercury in a small bedchamber is a medly scripturepiece in needle work with a border of animals pretty well done the work of mary stuart during her confinement in lochleven castle but the house in general is in a manner unfurnished  the gallery is about a hundred and fiftyfive feet long the top arched divided into compartments filled with paintings in water colors of different sorts of huntings and that nimrod james vi and his train appear in every piece  till the destruction of the abbey the kings of scotland were crowned here sitting in the famous wooden chair which edward i transported to westminsterabby much to the mortification of the scots who esteemed it as their palladium charles ii before the battle of worcester was crowned in the present chapel the old pretender resided at scone for a considerable time in      and his son made it a visit in       repassed the tay at bullions boat visited the field of loncarty celebrated for the great victory in the time of kenneth who began his reign in     obtained by the scots over the danes loncarty by means of the gallant peasant hay and his two sons who with no otherweapons than the yokes which they snatched from their oxen then at plough first put a stop to the flight of their countrymen and afterward led them on to conquest the noble family of hay are descended from this rustic hero and in memory of their action bear for their arms the instrument of their victory with the allusive motto of sub jugo there are on the spot several tumuli in which are frequently found bones deposited in loose stones disposed in form of a coffin not remote is a spot which supplied me with far more agreeable ideas a tract of ground which in      was a mere bog but now converted into good meadows and about fifty acres covered with linen several other parts with buildings and all the apparatus of the linen manufacture extremely curious and worth seeing carried on by the industrious family of the sandimans who annually make four hundred thousand yards of linen  the country is good full of barley oats and flax in abundance but after a few miles traveling is succeeded by a black heath ride through a beautiful plantation of pines and after descending an easy slope the plain beneath suddenly contracts itself into a narrow glen the prospect before me strongly marked the entrance into the highlands the hills that bounded it on each side being lofty and rude birnam wood on the left was birnam wood dunsinane which seems never to have recovered the march its ancestors made to dunsinane i was shown at a great distance a high ridge of hills where some remains of that famous fortress   macbeths castle are said yet to exist  the pass into the highlands is awefully magnificent high craggy and often naked mountains present themselves to view approach very near each other and in many parts are fringed with wood overhanging and darkening the tay that rolls with great rapidity beneath after some advance dunkeld cathedral vance in this hollow a most beautiful knowl covered with pines appears full in view and soon after the town of dunkeld seated under and environed by crags dunkeld partly naked partly wooded with summits of a vast height lay at inver a good inn on the west side of the river  crossed it in a boat attended by a tame swan july    which was perpetually soliciting our favors by putting its neck over the sides of the ferryboat land in the duke of athols gardens which are extremely pleasing washed by the river and commanding from different parts of the walks the most beautiful and picturesque views of wild and gloomy nature that can be conceived trees of all kinds grow here extremely well and even so southern a shrub as portugal laurel flourishes greatly in the gardens are the ruins of the cathedral once a magnificent aedifice as appears by the beautiful round pillars still standing but the choir is preserved and at present used as a church in the burialplace of the family is a large monument of the marquis of athol hung with the arms of the numerous connections of the family in another part is a tomb of an old bishop  on the other side the river is a pleasing walk along the banks of the water of bran rivers in scotland are very frequently called waters  a great and rapid torrent full of immense stones on a rock at the end of the walk is a neat building impending over a most horrible chasm into which the river precipitates itself with great noise and fury from a considerable height the windows of the pavillion are formed of painted glass some of the panes are red which makes the water resemble a fiery cataract about a mile further is another rumbling brig like but inferior in grandeur to that near kinross  the town of dunkeld is small and has a small linen manufacture much company resorts here in the summer months for the benefit of drinking goats milk and whey i was informed here that those animals will eat serpents as it is well known that stags do  after a ride of two miles along a narrow strait amidst trees and often in fight of the tay was driven by rain into a fishermans hut who entertained me with an account of his business said he paid ten pounds per ann for the liberty of two or three miles of the river sold the first fish of the season at threepence a pound after that got three shillings per fish the houses in these parts began to be covered with broom which lasts three or four years their insides mean and very scantily furnished but the owners civil sensible and of the quickest apprehensions  the strait now widens into a vale plentiful in oats barley and flax and well peopled on the right is the junction of the tay and the tumel the channels of these rivers are wide full of gravel the mark of their devastation during floods due north is the road to blair and fort augustus through the noted pass of killicrankie turn to the left ride opposite to castle menzies reach taymouth the seat of the earl of breadalbane  taymouth its name in old maps is balloch i e the mouth of the loch lies in a vale scarce a mile broad july    etc taymouth very fertile bounded on each side by high mountains finely planted those on the south are covered with trees or with corn fields far up their sides the hills on the north are planted with pines and other trees and vastly steep and have a very alpine look but particularly resemble the great slope opposite the grande chartreuse in dauphine his lordships policy this word here signifies improvements or demesne when used by a merchant or tradesman signifies their warehouses shops and the like surrounds the house which stands in the park and is one of the few in which sallow deer are seen  the ground is in remarkable fine order owing to his lordships assiduity in clearing it from stones with which it was once covered a blaster was in constant employ to blast the great stones with gunpowder for by reason of their size there was no other method of removing them  the berceau walk is very magnificent walks composed of great trees forming a fine gothic arch and probably that species of architecture owed its origin to such vaulted shades the walk on the bank of the tay is fifty feet wide and two and twenty hundred yards long but is to be continued as far as the junction of the tay and the lion which is about as far more the first runs on the sides of the walk with great rapidity is clear but not colorless for its pellucidness is like that of brown crystal as is the case with most of the rivers of scotland which receive their tinge from the bogs  the tay has here a wooden bridge two hundred feet long leading to a white feat on the side of the opposite hill commanding a fine view up and down straithtay the rich meadows beneath the winding of the river the beginning of loughtay the discharge of the river out of it the neat village and church of kenmor form a most pleasing and magnificent prospect  the view from the temple of venus is that of the lake loughtay with a nearer sight of the church and village and the discharge of the river the lake is about a mile broad and about fifteen long bounded on each side by lofty mountains makes three great bends which adds to its beauty those on the south are well planted and finely cultivated high up interspersed with the habitations of the highlanders not singly but in small groupes as if they loved society or clanship they are very small mean and without windows or chimnies and are the disgrace of north britain as its lakes and rivers are its glory loughtay is in many places a hundred fathoms deep and within as many yards of the shore fiftyfour  till the present year this lake was supposed to be as incapable of freezing as loughness loughearn and lougheach though loughraynac and even loughfine an arm of the sea often does but in march last so rigorous and uncommon was the cold that about the  0th of that month this vast body of water was frozen over in one part from side to side in the space of one night and so strong was the ice as greatly to damage a boat which was caught in it  loughtay abounds with pike perch eels salmon and trout of the last some have been taken that weighed above thirty pounds of these species the highlanders abhor eels and also lampries fancying from the form that they are too nearly related to serpents i was informed that at the head of the lake are the remains of an old castle called finlarig belonging to lord breadalbane and of a park finely wooded with old oaks chestnuts and other timber   the north side is less wooded but more cultivated the vast hill of laurs with beds of snow on it through great part of the year rises above the rest and the still loftier mountain of benmor closes the view far beyond the end of the lake all this country abounds with game such as grous ptarmigans br zool illustr    tab xiii  stags and a peculiar species of hare which is found only on the summits of the highest hills white hare and never mixes with the common kind which is frequent enough in the vales the same p  0 tab xlvii  this species is gray in summer white in winter is smaller than the brown hare and more delicate meat  the ptarmigans inhabit the very summits of the highest mountains ptarmigan amidst the rocks perching among the gray stones and during summer are scarce to be distinguished from them by reason of their color they seldom take long flights but fly about like pigeons are silly birds and so tame as to suffer a stone to be slung at them without rising it is not necessary to have a dog to find them they taste so like a grous as to be scarce distinguishable during winter their plumage except a few feathers in the tail are of a pure white the color of the snow in which they bury themselves in heaps as a protection from the rigorous air  royston crows birds called here hooded crows and in the erse feanagh are very common and reside here the whole year they breed in the hills in all sorts of trees lay six eggs have a thriller note than the common sort are much more mischievous pick out the eyes of lambs and even of horses when engaged in bogs but for want of other food will eat cranberries and other mountain berries  ring ouzels breed among the hills and in autumn descend in flocks to seed on the berries of the wicken trees  sea eagles breed in ruined towers but quit the country in winter the black eagles continue there the whole year  it is very difficult to leave the environs of this delightful place and before i go within doors i must recall to mind the fine winding walks on the south side of the hills the great beech sixteen feet in girth the picturesque birch with its long streaming branches the hermitage the great cataracts adjacent and the darksome chasm beneath i must enjoy over again the view of the fine reach of the tay and its union with the broad water of the lion i must step down to view the druidical circles of stones called in the erse tibberd and lastly taybridge i must visit taybridge and as far as my pen can contribute extend the same of our military countrymen cascade near taymouth who among other works worthy of the romans founded this bridge and left its history inscribed in these

rebuilt in the neatest manner by the present lord breadalbane they stand beautifully on a small headland projecting into the lake his lordship permits the inhabitants to live rentfree on condition they exercise some trade and keep their houses clean so that by these terms he not only saves the expense of sending on every trifling occasion to perth or crief but has got some as good workmen in common trades as any in his majestys dominions the congregation was numerous decent attentive still well and neatly clad and not a ragged or slovenly person among them there were two services one in english the other in erse after the first numbers of people of both sexes went out of church and fearing themselves in the churchyard made in their motly habits a gay and picturesque appearance the devotion of the common people highland congregation on the usual days of worship is as much to be admired as their conduct at the sacrament is to be censured it is celebrated but once in a year when there are in some places three thousand communicants and as many idle spectators as can crowd each side of a long table and the elements are rudely shoven from one to another and in some places fighting and other indecencies ensue it is often made a season for debauchery so to this day jack cannot be persuaded to eat his meat like a christian tale of a tub formerly the sacrament was administered but once in two years   every sunday a collection is made for the sick or necessitous for poors rates are unknown in every country parish in scotland notwithstanding the common people are but just rouzed from their native indolence very few beggars are seen in north britain either they are full masters of the lesson of being content with a very little or what is more probable they are possessed of a spirit that will struggle hard with necessity before it will bend to the asking of alms  visited a pretty little island tusted with trees in lochtay not far from the shore on it are the ruins of a priory or dependent on that at scoone founded in      by alexander the first in which were deposited the remains of his queen sybilla natural daughter to henry i it was founded by alexander to have the prayers of the monks for the repose of his soul and that of his royal confort as appears from a grant made by that monarch of the isle in lochtay ut ecclesia dei ibi pro me et pro anima syrillae reginae ibi desuncta fabricetur etc  to this island the campbells retreated during the successes of the marquess of montrose where they defended themselves against that hero which was one cause of his violent resentment against the whole name  rode to glenlion july    went by the side of the river this river freezes but the tay which receives it never does that gives name to it it has now lost its ancient title of duie or black given it on account of a great battle between the mackays and the macgregors after which the conquerors are said to have stained the water with red by washing in it their bloody swords and spears on the right is a rocky hill called shiballen or the paps enter glenlion through a strait pass the vale is narrow but fertile the banks of the river steep rocky and wooded through which appear the rapid water of the lion on the north is a round fortress on the top of the hill to which in old times the natives retreated on any invasion a little further on a plain is a small roman camp it possibly might have been made during the expedition of severus who penetrated to the extremity of this island it was the most northern work of the romans i had my intelligence of  called by the highlanders fortingal or the fort of the strangers themselves they style nafian or descendents of fingal in fortingal church are the remains of a prodigious yewtree great yew whose ruins measured fiftysix feet and a half in circumference  saw at a gentlemans house in glenlion a curious walkingstaff belonging to one of his ancestors it was iron cased in leather five feet long at the top a neat pair of extended wings like a caduceus but on being shook a poniard two feet nine inches long darted out  he also favored me with the fight of a very ancient brotche which the highlanders use like the fibula of the romans to fasten their vest it is made of silver is round with a bar cross the middle from whence are two tongues to fasten the solds of the garments one side is studded with pearl or coarse gems in a very rude manner on the other are certain letters i could not make out  return south and come at once in fight of lochtay the day being very fine and calm the whole scene was most beautifully repeated in the water i must not omit that on the north side of this lake is a most excellent road which runs the whole length of it leading to teindrum and inveraray in argyleshire and is the route which travelers must take who make what i call the petit tour which comprehends the route i have described adding to it from taymouth along the road on the side of the lake to killin    miles from thence to teindrum  0 glenorchie    inveraray    luss on the banks of lochlomond  0 dunbarton    glasgow    sterling    edinburgh by hopetounhouse    a tract unparalleled for the variety and frequency of fine and magnificent scenery of scotland this whole road was made at the sole expense of the present lord breadalbane who to facilitate the traveling also erected thirtytwo stonebridges over the torrents that rush from the mountains into the lake they will find the whole country excel in roads roads partly military partly done by statute labor and much by the munisicence of the great men  i was informed that lord breadalbanes estate was so extensive that he could ride a hundred miles an end on it even as far as the west sea where he has also some islands these great properties are divided into districts called officiaries a ground officer presides over each and has three four or five hundred men under his care he superintends the duties due from each to their lord such as fetching peat bringing coal from perth etc which they do at their own expense on horses backs traveling in strings the tail of one horse being fastened by a cord which reaches to the head of the next the horses are little and generally white or gray and as the farms are very small it is common for four people to keep a plough between them each furnishing a horse and this is called a horse gang  the north side of lochtay is very populous for in sixteen square miles are seventeen hundred and eightysix souls on the other side about twelve hundred the country within these thirty years is grown very industrious and manufactures a great deal of thread they spin with rocks their lord gives among them annually a great number of spinningwheels  which they do while they attend their cattle on the hills and at the three or four fairs in the year held at taymouth about sixteen hundred pounds worth of yarn is sold out of breadalbane only  much of this may be owing to the good sense and humanity of the chieftain but much again is owing to the abolition of the seudal tenures or vassalage for before that was effected which was done by the influence of a chancellor earl of hardwick  whose memory scotland gratefully adores for that service the strong oppressed the weak the rich the poor courts indeed were held and juries called but juries of vassals too dependent and too timid to be relied on for the execution of true justice  leave taymouth ford the lion aug   and ride above it through some woods on the left bursts out a fine cascade in a deep hollow covered with trees at a small distance to the west is castlegarth a small castle seated like castle campbell between two deep glens keep ascending a steep hill but the corn country continues for a while the scene then changes for a wild black and mountainous heath descend into raynach a meadowy plain raynach tolerably fertile the lake of the same name extends from east to west is about eleven miles long and one broad the northern banks appeared very barren part of the southern finely covered with a forest of pine and birch the first natural woods i had seen of pines pine forest rode a good way into it but observed no trees of any size except a birch sixteen feet in circumference the ground beneath the trees is covered with heath bilberies and dwarf arbutus whose glossy leaves make a pretty appearance this place gives shelter to black game and is at present the farthest southern resort of roes for very few ever straggle lower down near these woods is a sawmill which brings in about   0l per ann the deal which is the red sort is fold in plank to different parts of the country carried on horses backs for the trees are now grown so scarce as not to admit of exportation some potash is also made of the birch wood   the lake affords no other fish than trouts and bull trouts the last as i was informed are sometimes taken of the length of four feet and a half many water fowl breed in the birns or little streams that trickle into the lake among others different sort of grebes and diverse i was told of one which the inhabitants call turuvachal that makes a great noise before storms and by their description seems to be the fluder of gesner  this country was once the property of robertson the poet struan of struan who had been in the rebellion of      had his estate restored but in      rebelling a second time the country was burnt and the estate annexed to the crown he returned a few years after and died as he lived a most abandoned sot notwithstanding which he had a genius for poetry and left behind him a volume of elegies and other pieces in some of which he elegantly laments the ravages of war among his vassals and the loss of his favorite scenes and in particular his fountain argentine  the country is perfectly highland and in spite of the intercourse this and the neighboring parts have of late years had with the rest of the world it still retains some of its ancient customs and superstitions superstitions they decline daily but least their memory should be lost i shall mention several that are still practiced or but very lately difused in the tract i had passed over such a record will have this advantage when the follies are quite extinct in teaching the unshackled and enlightened mind the difference between the pure ceremonies of religion and the wild and anile flights of superstition  the belief in specter still exists specter of which i had a remarkable proof while i was in the county of breadalbane a poor visionary who had been working in his cabbagegarden imagined that he was raised suddenly into the air and conveyed over a wall into an adjacent cornfield that he found himself surrounded by a crowd of men and women many of whom he knew to have been dead some years and who appeared to him skimming over the tops of the unbended corn and mingling together like bees going to hive that they spoke an unknown language and with a hollow found that they very roughly pushed him to and fro but on his uttering the name of god all vanished but a female sprite who seizing him by the shoulder obliged him to promise an assignation at that very hour that day sevenight that he then found that his hair was all tied in double knots and that he had almost lost the use of his speech that he kept his word with the spectre whom he soon saw come floating through the air toward him that he spoke to her but she told him at that time she was in too much haste to attend to him but bid him go away and no harm should befall him and so the affair rested when i left the country but it is incredible the mischief these aegri somnia did in the neighborhood the friends and relation of the deceased whom the old dreamer had named were in the utmost anxiety at finding them in such bad company in the other world the almost extinct belief of the old idle tales began again to gain ground and the good minister will have many a weary discourse and exhortation before he can eradicate the absurd ideas this idle story has revived  in this part of the country the notion of witchcraft is quite lost it was observed to cease almost immediately on the repeal of the witch act a proof what a dangerous instrument it was in the hands of the vindictive or of the credulous  among the superstitious customs these are the most singular unlucky day a highlander never begins any thing of consequence on the day of the week on which the  d of may falls which he styles lagh sbeacbanna na bleanagh or the dismal day  on the  st of may beltein the herdsmen of every village hold their beltein my account of this and every other ceremony mentioned in this journal was communicated to me by gentlemen resident on the spot where they were performed  a rural sacrifice they cut a square trench on the ground leaving the turf in the middle on that they make a fire of wood on which they dress a large caudle of eggs butter oatmeal and milk and bring besides the ingredients of the caudle plenty of beer and whisky for each of the company must contribute something the rites begin with spilling some or the caudle on the ground by way of libation on that every one takes a cake of oatmeal upon which are raised nine square knobs each dedicated to some particular being the supposed preserver of their flocks and herds or to some particular animal the real destroyer of them each person then turns his face to the fire breaks off a knob and flinging it over his shoulders says this i give to thee preserve thou my horses this to thee preserve thou my sheep and so on after that they life the same ceremony to the noxious animals this i give to thee 0 fox spare thou my lambs this to thee o hooded crow this to thee o eagle  when the ceremony is over they dine on the caudle and after the feast is finished what is left is hid by two persons deputed for that purpose but on the next sunday they reassemble and finish the relics of the first entertainment a custom favoring of the scotch beltein prevails in gloucestershire particularly about newent and the neighboring parishes on the twelfth day or on the epiphany in the evening all the servants of every particular farmer assemble together in one or the fields that has been sown with wheat on the border of which in the most conspicuous or most elevated place they make twelve fires of straw in a row around one of which made larger than the rest they drink a cheerful glass of cider to their masters health success to the future harvest and then returning home they feast on cakes made of carraways etc soaked in cider which they clame as a reward for their past labors in sowing the grain this seems to resemble a custom of the ancient danes who in their addresses to their rural deities emptied on every invocation a cup in honor of them niordi et frejae memoria poculis recolebatur annua ut ipsis contingeret selicitas frugumque et reliqua annona uberrimus proventus worm monum dan lib i p      on the death of a highlander funeral customs the corpse being stretched on a board and covered with a coarse linen wrapper the friends lay on the breast of the deceased a wooden platter containing a small quantity of salt and earth separate and unmixed the earth an emblem of the corruptible body the salt an emblem of the immortal spirit all fire is extinguished where a corpse is kept and it is reckoned so ominous for a dog or cat to pass over it that the poor animal is killed without mercy  the latewake is a ceremony used at funerals the latewake the evening after the death of any person the relations and friends of the deceased meet at the house attended by bagpipe or fiddle the nearest of kin be it wife son or daughter opens a melancholy ball dancing and greeting i e crying violently at the same time and this continues till daylight but with such gambols and frolicks among the younger part of the company that the loss which occasioned them is often more than supplied by the consequences of that night if the corpse remains unburied for two nights the same rites are renewed thus scythianlike they rejoice at the deliverance of their friends out of this life of misery  the coranich coranich or singing at funerals is still in use in some places the songs are generally in praise of the deceased or a recital of the valiant deeds of him or ancestors i had not the fortune to be present at any in north britain but formerly assisted at one in the south of ireland where it was performed in the fullness of horror the cries are called by the irish the ulogobne and hullulu two words extremely expressive of the found uttered on these occasions and being of celtic stock etymologists would swear to be the origin of the  of the greeks and ululatus of the latins virgil is very fond of using the last whenever any of his females are distressed as are others of the roman poets and generally on occasions similar to this  it was my fortune to arrive at a certain town in kerry at the time that a person of some distinction departed this life my curiosity led me to the house where the funeral seemed conducted in the purest classical form  quodcunque aspicerem luctus gemitusque sonabant formaque non taciti funeris intus erat  in short the conclamatio was set up by the friends in the fame manner as virgil describes that consequential of didos death  lamentis gemituque et faemines ululatu tecta fremunt  immediately after this followed another ceremony fully described by cambden in his account of the manners of the ancient irish the earnest expostulations and reproaches given to the deceased for quitting this world where she enjoyed so many blessings so good a husband such fine children this custom is of great antiquity for euryaluss mother makes the same pathetic address to her dead son  tune ilia senectae sera meae requies potuisti relinquere solam crudelis  but when the time approached for carrying out the corpse the cry was redoubled  tremulis ululatibus aethera complent  a numerous band of females waiting in the outer court to attend the hearse and to pay in chorus the last tribute of their voices the habit of this sorrowing train and the neglect of their persons were admirably suited to the occasion their robes were black and flowing resembling the ancient palla their hair long and disheveled i might say  vidi egomet nigra succinctam vadere palla canidiam pedibus nudis passoque capillo cum sagana mojore ululantem  among these mourners were dispersed the females who sung the praises of the deceased and were in the place of the mulieres praeficae of the romans and like them were a mercenary tribe i could not but observe that they overdid their parts as horace acquaints us the mourners of his days did  ut qui conducti plorant in funera dicunt et saciunt prope plura dolentibus ex animo  the corpse was carried slowly along the verge of a most beautiful lake the ululatus was continued and the whole procession ended among the venerable ruins of an old abbey but to return to north britain  midwives give newborn babes a small spoonful of earth and whisky as the first food they taste  before women bake their bannocks or oatmeal cakes they make a cross on the last  the notion of secondsight still prevales in a few places fairies as does the belief of fairies and children are watched till the christening is over least

pounds in money given and nine pounds lent to begin the world with in some few places this plan succeeded but in general was frustrated by the dissipation of these new colonists who could by no means relish an industrious life but as soon as the money was spent which seldom lasted long left their tenements to be possessed by the next comer  saw a stampingmill calculated to reduce limestone to a fine power in order to lave the expense of burning for manure the stampers beat it into small pieces in a trough which a stream of water passed through carrying off the fine parts into a proper

omitted the relation is therefore given as described by sir david lindsay hist scotland      who in all probability assisted at it  the earl of athole hearing of the kings coming made great provision for him in all things pertaining to a prince that he was as well served and eased with all things necessary to his estate as he had been in his own palace of edinburgh for i heard say this noble earl gart make a curious palace to the king to his mother and to the ambassador where they were so honorably eased and lodged as they had been in england france italy or spain concerning the time and equivalent for their hunting and pastime which was builded in the midst of a fair meadow a fair palace of green timber wind with green birks that were green both under and above which was fashioned in four quarters and in every quarter and nuik thereof a great round as it had been a blockhouse which was lofted and gested the space of three house height the floors laid with green scarets spreats medwarts and flowers that no man knew whereon he zeid but as he had been in a garden further there were two great rounds in ilk side of the gate and a great portculleis of tree falling down with the manner of a barrace with a drawbridge and a great stank of water of sixteen foot deep and thirty foot of breadth and also this palace within was hung with fine tapestry and arrasses of silk and lighted with fine glass windows in all airths that this palace was as pleasantly decored with all necessaries pertaining to a prince as it had been his own palaceroyal at home further this earl gart make such provision for the king and his mother and the ambassador that they had all manner of meats drinks and delicates that were to be gotten at that time in all scotland either in burgh or land

stewards cunning baxters excellent cooks and potingars with confections and drugs for their deserts and the halls and chambers were prepared with costly bedding vessel and napery according for a king so that he wanted none of his orders more than he had been at home in his own palace the king remained in this wilderness at the hunting the space of three days and three nights and his company as i have shown i heard men say it cost the earl of athole every day in expenses a thousand pounds  but hunting meetings among the great men were often the preludes to rebellion for under that pretense

fifteen hundred men and horses the manner of the hunting is this five or six hundred men do rise early in the morning and they do disperse themselves diverse ways and seven eight or ten miles compass they do bring or chase in the deer in many herds two three or four hundred in a heard to such or such a place as the noblemen shall appoint them then when day is come the lords and gentlemen of their companies do ride or go to the said places sometimes wading up to the middles through bournes and rivers and then they being come to the place do lie down on the ground till those foresaid scouts which are called the tinekhell do bring down the deer but as the proverb says of a bad cook so these tinckhell men do lick their own singers for besides their bows and arrows which they carry with them we can hear now and then a harguebuse or a musket go off which do seldom discharge in vain then after we had stayed three hours or there abouts we might perceive the deer appear on the hills round about us their heads making a show like a wood which being followed close by the tinckhell are chased down into the valley where we lay then all the valley on each side being waylaid with a hundred couple of strong irish greyhounds they are let loose as occasion serves upon the heard of dear that with dogs gunnes arrows durks and daggers in the space of two hours fourscore fat dear were

fifty years ago to curb the discontented chieftains but at present unnecessarily garrisoned by a company of foot being rented by the government from mr farquharson of invercauld whose house i reached

from the several parts of it on the northern entrance immense ragged and broken crags bound one side of the prospect over whose gray sides and summits is scattered the melancholy green of the picturesque pine which grows out of the naked rock where one would think nature would have denied vegetation  a little lower down is the castle abovementioned formerly a necessary curb on the little kings of the country but at present serves scarce any real purpose but to adorn the landscape  the views from the skirts of the plain near invercauld are very great the hills that immediately bound it are clothed with trees particularly with birch whose long and pendent boughs waving a vast height above the head surpass the beauties of the weeping willow  the southern extremity is preeminently magnificent the mountains form there a vast theater the bosom of which is covered with extensive forests of pines above the trees grow scarcer and scarcer and then seem only to sprinkle the surface after braemar castle which vegetation ceases and naked summits the highest is called ben y bourd under which is a small lough which i was told had ice the latter end of july of a surprising height

from rock to rock to a vast distance  some of these hills are supposed to be the highest part of great britain their height has not yet been taken but the conjecture is made from the great descent of the dee which runs from braemar the most distant from the sea of any place in north britain to the sea above seventy miles with a most rapid course  rode to take a nearer view of the environs crossed the dee on a good stone bridge built by the government and entered on excellent roads into a magnificent forest of pines of many miles extent pine forest some of the trees are of a vast size i measured several that were ten eleven and even twelve feet in circumference and near sixty feet high forming a most beautiful column with a fine verdant capital these trees are of a great age having as is supposed seen two centuries the value of these trees is considerable mr farqubarson informed me that by sawing and retailing them he has got for eight hundred trees fiveandtwenty shillings each they are sawed in an adjacent sawmill into plank ten feet long eleven inches broad and three thick and sold for two shillings apiece  near this ancient forest is another consisting of smaller trees almost as high but very slender one grows in a singular manner out of the top of a great stone and notwithstanding it seems to have no other nourishment than what it gets from the dews is above thirty feet high  the prospect above these forests is very extraordinary a distant view of hills over a surface of verdant pyramids of pines  this whole tract abounds with game stags the stags at this time

most valuable movables  the houses of the common people in these parts are shocking to humanity cottages formed of loose stones and covered with clods which they call devish or with heath broom or branches of fir they look at a distance like so many black molehills the inhabitants live very poorly on oatmeal barleycakes and potatoes their drink whisky sweetened with honey the men are thin but strong idle and lazy except employed in the chase or any thing that looks like amusement are content with their hard fare and will not exert themselves farther than to get what they deem necessaries the women are more industrious spin their own husbands clothes and get money by knitting stockings the great trade of the county the common women are in general most remarkably plain and soon acquire an old look and by being much exposed to the weather without hats such a grin and contraction of the muscles as heightens greatly their natural hardness of features i never saw so much plainness among the lower rank of females but the ne plus ultra of hard features is not found till you arrive among the fishwomen of aberdeen  tenants pay their rent generally in this country in money except what they pay in poultry which is done to promote the breed as the gentry are so remote from any market those that rent a mill pay a hog or two an animal so detested by the highlanders that very few can be

river side in sight of the pine forests the vale now grows narrow and is filled with woods of birch and alder saw on the roadside the seats of gentlemen high built and once defensible the peasants

mountains approach each other quit the highlands passing between two great rocks pass of bellitir called the pass of bollitir a very narrow strait whose bottom is covered with the tremendous ruins of the precipices that bound the road i was informed that here the wind rages with great fury during winter and catching up the snow in eddies whirls it about with such impetuosity as makes it dangerous for man or beast to be out at that time rain also pours down sometimes in deluges and carries with it stone and gravel from the hills in such quantity that i have seen these spates as they are called lie cross the roads as the avelenches or snowfalls do those of the alps in many parts of the highlands were bospitia for the reception of travelers called by the scotch spittles or hospitals the same were usual in wales where they are styled yspitty and in both places were maintained by the religious houses as similar asylums are to this day supported in many parts of the alps  this pass is the eastern entrance into the highlands the country now assumes a new face the hills grow less but the land more barren and is chiefly covered with heath and rock the edges of the dee are cultivated but the rest only in patches among which is generally a groupe of small houses there is also a change of trees oak being the principal wood but not much of that refreshed my horses at a hamlet called tulloch and looking west saw the great mountain lagbin y gair which is always covered with snow  observed several vast plantations of pines planted by gentlemen near their seats such a laudable spirit prevails in this respect that in another halfcentury it never shall be said that to spy the nakedness of the land are you come  dine at the little village of kincaird hereabouts the common people

hundred tuns the town is about two miles in circumference and contains thirteen thousand souls and about three thousand in the suburbs it once enjoyed a good share of the tobacco trade but was at length forced to resign it to glasgow which was so much more conveniently situated for it at present its imports are from the baltic and a few merchants trade to the west indies and north america stocking trade its exports are stockings thread salmon and oatmeal the first is a most important article as appears by the following state of it for this manufacture  0 00 pounds worth of wool is annually imported and   00 pounds worth of oil of this wool is annually made       dozen pairs of stockings worth at an average  l  0s per dozen these are made by the country people in almost all parts of this great county who get  s per dozen for spinning and   s per dozen for knitting so that there is annually paid them      l   s and besides there is about  000l value of stockings manufactured from the wool of the county which encourages the breed of sheep much for even as high as invercauld the farmer sells his sheep at twelve shillings apiece and keeps them till they are four or five years old for the sake of the wool about  00 combers are also employed constantly the thread manufacture is another considerable article though trifling in comparison of the woollen  the salmon fisheries on the dee and the don salmon are a good branch of trade about    boats and   0 men are employed on the first and in some years    000lb of fish have been sent pickled to london and about   0 barrels of salted fish exported to france italy etc the fishery on the don is far less considerable  the town of aberdeen is in general well built with granite from the neighboring quarries

suffered and with a reply to her enquiring friends worthy a roman matron being asked why she did not make a better defense on her trial answered my persecutors have destroyed my honor and my life is not now worth the pains of defending the last instance of national credulity on this head was the story of the witches of thurso who tormenting for a long time an honest fellow under the usual form of cats at last provoked him so that one night he put them to flight with his broad sword and cut off the leg of one less nimble than the rest on his taking it up to his amazement he found it belonged to a female of his own species and next morning discovered the owner an old hag with only the companion leg to this the horrors of this tale were considerably abated in the place i heard it by an unlucky enquiry made by one in company viz in what part would the old woman have suffered had the man cut off the cats tail but these relations of almost obsolete superstitions must never be thought a

called here cairn lean or a gray tower that i saw was about   0 yards in circumference round and raised so high above the ground as to form a considerable mount on the top was an extensive but shallow hollow within were three low concentric galleries at small distances from each other covered above with large stones and the sidewalls were about four or five feet thick rudely made there are generally three of these places near each other so that each may be seen from any one whether these were the suffugia hiemi aut receptacula frugibus of the picts as they were of the germans or whether they might not have been used for religious purposes as such hollows have been in norway worm monum lib v p    i will not pretend to decide if the last i would suppose some of the galleries to be for the priests the others for the victims who were chosen by lot and who might be brought to be sacrificed in the concave area above which was well adapted to retain their blood that was to be sprinkled on the spectators on the posts of their houses and on the sails of their ships  kept along the shore northward about a mile from the castle are some small cliffs of freestone aug    in one is

superstition  in certain places the death of people is supposed to be foretold by the cries and shrieks of benshi or the fairies wife uttered along the very path where the funeral is to pass and what in wales are called corpse candles are often imagined to appear and foretell mortality  marriage customs the courtship of the highlander has these remarkable circumstances attending it after privately obtaining the consent of the fair he formally demands her of the father the lover and his friends assemble on a hill allotted for that purpose in every parish and one of them is dispatched to obtain permission to wait on the daughter if he is successful he is again sent to invite the father and his friends to ascend the hill and partake of a whisky cask which is never forgot the lover advances

this time the commodities were skins various necessaries brought in by the pedlars coarse country cloths cheese butter and meal the last in goatskin bags the butter lapped in cawls or leaves of the broad alga or tang and great quantities of birch wood and hazel cut into lengths for carts etc which had been floated down the river from loughness  highland dress the fair was a very agreeable circumstance and afforded a most singular groupe of highlanders in all their motly dresses their brecban or played consists of twelve or thirteen yards of a narrow stuff wrapped round the middle and reaches to the knees is often fastened round the middle with a belt and is then called brechanseal but in cold weather is large enough to wrap round the whole body from head to feet and this often is their only cover not only within doors but on the open hills during the whole night it is frequently fastened on the shoulders with a pin often of silver and before with a brotche like the fibula of the romans which is sometimes of silver and both large and expensive the old ones have very frequently mottos  the stockings are short and are tied below the knee the cuoranen is a sort of laced shoe made of a skin with the hairy side out but now seldom worn the truish were worn by the gentry and were breeches and stockings made of one piece  the fillebeg i e little played also called kelt is a sort of short petticoat reaching only to the knees and is a modern substitute for the lower part of the played being found to be less cumbersome especially in time of action when the highlanders used to tuck their brechan into their girdle almost all have a great pouch of badger and other skins with tassels dangling before in this they keep their tobacco and money  their ancient arms were the lochaber ax arms now used by none but the townguard of edinburgh a tremendous weapon better to be expressed by a figure than words  the broadsword and target with the last they covered themselves with the first reached their enemy at a great distance these were their ancient weapons as appears by simul constantia simul art britanni ingentibus gladiis et brevibus  missilia nostrorum vitare vel extutere vita agricolae c    tacitus but since the difarming act are scarcely to be met with partly owing to that partly to the spirit of industry now rising among them the highlanders in a few years will scarce know the use of any weapon  bows and arrows were used in war as late as the middle of the last century as i find in a manuscript life of sir ewin cameron  the dirk was a sort of dagger stuck in the belt i frequently saw this weapon in the shambles of inverness converted into a batchers knife being like hudibrass dagger  a serviceable dudgeon either for fighting or for drudging  the dirk was a weapon used by the ancient caledonians for dio cassius in his account of the expedition of severus mentions it under the name of pugio  the mattucashlash or armpit dagger was worn there ready to be used on coming to close quarters these with a pistol stuck in the girdle completely armed the highlander major who wrote about the year      thus describes their arms arcum et sagittas

piery cross it will be fit to mention here the method the chieftains took formerly to assemble the clans for any military expedition in every clan there is a known place of rendezvous styled carn a whin to which they must resort on this signal a person is sent out full speed with a pole burnt at one end and bloody at the other and with a cross at the top which is called croshtairie the cross of shame or the fiery cross the first from the disgrace they would undergo if they declined appearing the second from the penalty of having fire and sword carried through their country in case of refusal

breadalbane and passed through a tract of thirtytwo miles in three hours but without effect  the womens dress is the kirch or a white piece of linen womens dress pinned over the foreheads of those that are married and round the hind part of the head falling behind over their necks the single women wear only a ribband round their head which they call a snood the tanac or played hangs over their shoulders and is fattened before with a brotche but in bad weather is drawn over their heads in the county of breadalbane many wear when in high dress a great pleated stocking of an enormous length called ossan in other respects their dress resembles that of women of the same rank in england but their condition is very different being little better than slaves to our sex  the manners of the native highlanders may justly be expressed in these words character of the highlanders indolent to a high degree unless rouzed to war or to any animating amusement or i may say from experience to lend any disinterested assistance to the distressed traveller either in directing him on his way or affording their aid in passing the dangerous torrents of the highlands hospitable to the highest degree and full of generosity are much affected with the civility of strangers and have in themselves a natural politeness and addrese which often flows from the meanest when left expected through my whole tour i never met with a single instance of national reflection their forbearance proves them to be superior to the meanness of retaliation i fear they pity us but i hope not indiscriminately are excessively inquisitive after your business your name and other particulars of little consequence to them most curious after the politics of the world and when they can procure an old newspaper will listen to it with all the avidity of shakespeares blacksmith have much pride and consequently are impatient of affronts and revengefull of injuries are decent in their general behavior inclined to superstition yet attentive to the duties of religion and are capable of giving a most distinct account of the principles of their faith but in many parts of the highlands their character begins to be more faintly marked they mix more with the world and become daily less attached to their chiefs the clans begin to disperse themselves through different parts of the country finding that their industry and good conduct afford them better protection since the due execution of the laws than any their chieftain can afford and the chieftain tafting the sweets of advanced rents and the benefits of industry damnisses from his table the crowds of retainers the former instruments of his oppression and freakish tyranny  most of the ancient sports of the highlanders highland sports such as archery hunting fowling and billing are now difused those retained are throwing the puttingstone or stone of strength cloch neart  as they call it which occasions an emulation who can throw a weighty one the farthest throwing the pennystone which answers to our coits the shinty or the striking a ball of wood or of hair this game is played between two parties in a large plain and furnished with clubs whichever side strikes it first to their own goal wins the match  the amusements by their firesides were the telling of tales the wildest and most extravagant imaginable music was another in former times the harp was the favorite instrument covered with leather and strung with wire major says pro musicis instrumentis et musico concentu lyra sylvestres utuntur cujus chordas ex aere et non

when secure and collected them when scattered this instrument is become scarce since the abolition of the power of the chieftains and the more industrious turn of the common people  vocal music was much in vogue amongst them and their songs were chiefly in praise of their ancient heroes i was told that they still have fragments of the story of fingal and others which they carrol as they go along

along its banks a most romantic and beautiful scenery generally in woods of birch or hazel mixed with a few holly whitethorn aspin ash and oak but open enough in all parts to admit a sight of the water sometimes the road was strait for a considerable distance and resembled a fine and regular avenue in others it wound about the sides of the hils which overhung the lake the road was frequently cut through the rock which on one side formed a solid wall on the other a steep precipice in many parts we were immersed in woods in others they opened and gave a view of the sides and tops of the vast mountains soaring above some of these were naked but in general covered with wood except on the mere precipices or where the gray rocks denied vegetation or where the heath now glowing with purple blossoms covered the surface the form of these hills was very various and irregular either broken into frequent precipices or towering into rounded summits clothed with trees but not so castle urqhuart close but to admit a sight of the sky between them thus for many miles there was no possibility of cultivation yet this tract was occupied by diminutive cattle by sheep or by goats the last were pied and lived most luxuriously on the tender branches of the trees the wild animals that possessed this picturesque scene were stags and roes black game and grous and on the summits white hares and ptarmigans foxes are so numerous and voracious that the farmers are sometimes forced to house their sheep as is done in france for fear of the wolves it is to me matter of surprise that no mention is made in the poems of ossian of our greater beasts of prey which must have abounded in his days for the wolf was a pest to the country so late as the reign of queen elizabeth and the bear existed there at lest till the year  0   when a gordon for killing a fierce bear was directed by the king to carry three bears heads in his banner other native animals are often mentioned in several parts of the work and in the five little poems on night compositions of as many bards every modern british beast of chase is enumerated the howling dog and howling fox described yet the howling wolf omitted which would have made the bards night much more hideous   the north side of loughness is far less beautiful than the south in general the hills are less high but very steep in a very few places covered with brushwood but in general very naked from the hiding of the strata down their sloping sides about the middle is castle urqhuart castle urqhuart a fortress founded on a rock projecting into the lake and was said to have been the seat of the once powerful cummins near it is the broadest part of the lough occasioned by a bay near the castle  above is glenmoriston and east of that

at a time are taught for three months to spin and then another forty taken in there are besides six looms and all supported out of the forseited lands  above is the great mountain meal fourvounich the first land sailors make from the east sea on the top is a lake said to be  00 fathoms deep  i was informed that in that neighborhood are glens and cascades of surprising beauty but my time did not permit me to visit them  dined at a poor inn near the generals hut or the place where general wade resided when he inspected the great work of the roads and gave one rare example of making the soldiery useful in time of peace near is a fine glen covered at the bottom with wood through which runs a torrent rising southward the country also is prettily varied with woods and cornfieldsd  fall of fyers about a mile farther is the fall of fyers a vast cataract in a darksome glen of a stupendous depth the water darts far beneath the top through a narrow gap between two rocks then precipitates above forty feet lower into the bottom of the chasm and the foam like a great cloud of smoke rises and fills the air the sides of this glen are vast precipices mixed with trees overhanging the water through which after a short space the waters discharge themselves into the lake  about half a mile south of the first fall is another passing through a narrow chasm whose sides upper fall of tyers it has undermined for a considerable way over the gap is a true alpine bridge of the bodies of trees covered with sods from whole middle is an awefull view of the water roaring beneath  at the fall of fyers the road quits the side of the lake and is carried for some space through a small vale on the side of the river fyers where is a mixture of small plains of corn and rocky hills then succeeds a long and dreary moor a tedious ascent up the mountain seewhinnin or cummins seat whose summit is of a great height and very craggy descend a steep road leave on the right loughtaarf a small irregular piece of water decked with little wooded isles and abounding with char after a second steep descent reach fort augustus its erse name is kilwhinnin or the burialplace of the cummins it lies on the road to the isle of sky which is about    miles off but on the whole way there is not a place sit for the reception of man or horse  a small fortress fort augusius seated on a plain at the head of loughness between the rivers taarf and oich the last is considerable and has over it a bridge of three arches the fort consists of four bastions within is the governors house and barracks for  00 men it was taken by the rebels in      who immediately deserted it after demolishing as much as they could  loughness is twentytwo miles in length loughness the breadth from one to two miles except near castle urqbuart where it swells out to three the depth is very great opposite the rock called the horseshoe near the west end it has been found to be   0 fathoms from an eminence near the fort is a full view of its whole extent for it is perfectly strait running from east to west with a point to the south the boundary from the fall of fyers is very steep and rocky which obliged general wade to make that detour from its banks partly on account of the expense in cutting through so much solid rock partly through an apprehension that in case of a rebellion the troops might be destroyed in their march by the tumbling down of stones by the enemy from above besides this a prodigious arch must have been slung over the glen of fyers  this lake never freezes by reason of its great depth never freezes and during cold weather a violent steam rises from it as from a furnace ice brought from other parts and put into loughness instantly thaws but no water freezes sooner than that of the lake when brought into a house its water is esteemed very falubrious so that people come or send thirty miles for it old lord lovat in particular made constant use of it but it is certain whether it be owing to the water or to the air of that neighborhood that for seven years the garrison of fort augustus had not lost a single man  the fish of this lake are salmon which are in season from christmas to midsummer trouts of about  lb weight pikes and eels during winter it is frequented by swans and other wild fowls  the greatest rise of water in loughness is fourteen feet the lakes from whence it receives its supplies are loughoich louchgarrie and loughquich there is but very little navigation on it the only vessel is a gally belonging to the fort to bring the stores from the east end the river ness being too shallow for navigation  it is violently agitated by the winds its agitations in      and at times the waves are quite mountainous november  st      at the same time as the earthquake at lisbon these waters were affected in a very extraordinary manner they rose and flowed up the lake from east to west with vast impetuosity and were carried above  00 yards up the river oich breaking on its banks in a wave near three feet high then continued ebbing and flowing for the space of an hour but at eleven oclock a wave greater than any of the rest came up the river broke on the north side and overflowed the bank for the extent of  0 feet a boat near the generals hut laden with brushwood was thrice driven ashore and twice carried back again but the last time the rudder was broken the wood forced out and the boat filled with water and left on shore at the same time a little isle in a small lough in badenoch was totally reversed and slung on the beach but at both these places no agitation was felt on land  rode to the castle of tordown sept   castle of tordown a rock two miles west of fort augustus on the summit is an ancient fortress the face of this rock is a precipice on the accessible side is a strong dyke of loose stones above that a ditch and a little higher a terrass supported by stones on the top a small oval area hollow in the middle round this area for the depth of near twelve feet are a quantity of stones strangely cemented with almost vitrified matter and in some places quite turned into black scoria the stones were generally granite mixed with a few gritstones of a kind not found nearer the place than  0 miles whether this was the ancient site of someforge forge of whether the stones which form this fortress i was informed that at arisaig is an old castle formed of the same materials had been collected from the strata of some vulcano for the vestiges of such are said to have been found in the highlands i submit to farther enquiry  from this rock is a view of benki a vast craggy mountain above glengarries country toward the south is the high mountain coryarich the ascent from this side is nine miles but on the other into badenoch is very rapid and not above one the road being for the ease of the traveller cut in a zigzag fashion people often perish on the summit of this hill which is frequently visited during winter with dreadful storms of snow  after a short ride westward along the plain sept   reach loughoich a narrow lake the sides prettily indented and the water adorned with small wooded isles glengarrie on the shore is glengarrie the seat of mr mdonald almost surrounded with wood and not far distant is the ruin of the old castle this lake is about four miles long the road on the south side is excellent and often carried through very pleasant woods  after a small interval arrive on the banks of loughlochy loughlochy a fine piece of water fourteen miles long and from one to two broad the distant mountains on the north were of an immense height those on the south had the appearance of fine sheepwalks the road is continued on the side of the lake about eight miles on the opposite shore was acbnacarrie once the seat of cameron of lochiel but burnt in      he was esteemed by all parties the honestest and most sensible man of any that embarked in the pernicious and absurd attempt of that and the preceding year by his influence he prevented the rebels from committing several excesses and even saved the city of glasgow from being plundered when their army returned out of england irritated with their disappointment and enraged at the loyalty that city had shown the pretender came to him as soon as ever he landed lochiel seeing him arrive in so wild a manner and so unsupported entreated him to desist from an enterprise from which nothing but certain ruin could result to him and his partisans the adventurer grew warm and reproached lochiel with a breach of promise this affected him so deeply that he instantly went and took a tender and moving leave of his lady and family foreseeing he was on the point of parting with them for ever the income of his estate was at that time as i was told not above  00  per ann yet he brought fourteen hundred men into the field  the waters of this lake form the river lochy and discharge themselves into the western sea as those of loughoich do through loughness into the eastern about the beginning of this lake enter lochaber so called from a lake not far from fort william near whose banks banque was said to have been murdered stop at lowbridge a poor house lochaber travel over a black moor for some miles see abundance of cattle but scarce any corn cross  highbridge a fine bridge of three arches flung over the torrent spean founded on rocks two of the arches are    feet high this bridge was built by general wade in order to form a communication with the country these public works were at first very disagreeable to the old chieftains it lessened their influence greatly for by admitting strangers among them their clans were taught that the lairds were not the first of men but they had another reason much more solid lochaber had been a den of thieves and as long as they had their waters their torrents and their bogs in a state of nature they made their excursions could plunder and retreat with their booty in full security so weak were the laws in many parts of north britain till after the late rebellion that no stop could be put to this infamous practice a contribution called the black meal was raised by several of these plundering chieftains over a vast extent of country whoever paid it had their cattle ensured but those who dared to refuse were sure to suffer many of these freebooters were wont to insert an article by which they were to be released from their agreement in case of any civil commotion thus at the breaking out of the last rebellion a mgregor who assumed the name of graham who had with the strictest honor till that event preserved his friends cattle immediately sent them word that from that time they were out of his protection and must now take care of themselves barrisdale was another of this class chief of a band of robbers who spread terror over the whole country but the highlanders at that time esteemed the open theft of cattle or the making a spreith as they called it by no means dishonorable and the young men considered it as a piece of gallantry by which they recommended themselves to their mistresses on the other side there was often as much bravery in the pursuers for frequent battles ensued and much blood has been spilt on those occasions they also showed great dexterity in tracing the robbers not only through the boggy land but over the firmest ground and even over places where other cattle had passed knowing well how to distinguish the steps of those that were wandering about from those that were driven hastily away by the freebooters  from the road had a distant view of the mountains of arisaig beyond which were moydart kinloch etc at the end of lough shiel the pretender first set up his standard in the wildest place that imagination can frame the inhabitants of this country are mostly papists and here the strength of the rebellion lay  pass by the side of the river lochy now considerable inverlochy see inverlochy castle with four large round towers the largest is called cummins tower these towers so greatly resemble those built by the same monarch in north wales that i scarce hesitate to attribute this castle to him by several accounts it appears that there had been a castle on the same spot built many centuries prior to this ruin and it is also asserted that the league between charlemagne and achaius king of scotland was signed by the latter in it  which by the mode of building seems to have been the work of the english in the time of edward i who laid large fines on the scotch barons for the purpose of erecting new castles reach  fort william built in king williams reign as was a small town near it called maryborough in honor of his queen but prior to that had been a small fortress erected by order of cromwell with whose people the famous sir ewen cameron who is said to have killed last wolf in scotland about the year    0 had numerous contests the present fort is a triangle has two bastions and is capable of admitting a garrison of eight hundred men it was well defended against the rebels in      who raised the siege with much disgrace the fort lies on a narrow arm of the sea called lochyell which extends some miles higher up the country making a bend to the north and extends likewise westward toward the isle of mull near twentyfour scotch miles  this fort on the west and fort augustus in the center and fort george on the east the chain form what is called the chain from sea to sea this space is called glenmore or the great glen which including water and land is almost a level of seventy miles there is in fact but little land but what is divided by firth lough or river except the two miles which lie between lough oich and lough lochy by means of fort george all entrance up the firth toward inverness is prevented fort augustus curbed the inhabitants midway and fort william is a check to any attempts on the west detahments are made from all these garrisons to inverness bernera barracks opposite to the isle of sky and castle duart in the isle of mull i was informed that coal has been lately discovered in this island what advantage may not this prove in establishments of manufacture in a country just rouzed from the lap of indolence  other small parries ate also scattered in huts throughout the country to prevent the stealing of castle  fort william is surrounded by vast mountains which occasion almost perpetual rain the loftiest are on the south side benevish soars above the rest benevish and ends as i was told in a point at this time concealed in mist whose height from the sea is said to be    0 yards as an ancient briton i lament the disgrace of snowdon once esteemed the highest hill in the island but now must yield the palm to a caledonian mountain but i have my doubts whether this might not be rivaled or perhaps surpassed by others in the same country for example ben y bourd a central hill from whence to the tea there is a continued and rapid descent of seventy miles as may be seen by the violent course of the dee to aberdeen but their height has not yet been taken which to be done fairly must be from the sea benevish as well as many others harbor snow throughtout the year  the bad weather which reigned during my stay in these parts prevented me from visiting the celebrated parallel roads in glenroy as i am unable to satify the curiosity of the reader from my own observation i shall deliver in the appendix no iii the informations i could collect relating to these amazing works  the great produce of lochaber is cattle trade of lochabers that district alone fends out annually  000 head but if a portion of invernessshire is included of which this properly is part the number is  0000 there are also a few horses bred here and a very few sheep but of late several have been imported scarce any arable land for the excessive wet which reigns here almost totally prevents the growth of corn and what little there is fit for tillage sets at ten shillings an acre the inhabitants of this district are therefore obliged for their support to import six thousand bolls of oatmeal annually which cost about  000l the rents are about  000l per ann the return for their cattle is about   00  the horses may produce some trifle so that the tenants must content themselves with a very scanty subsistence without the prospect of saying the lest against unforeseen accidents the rage of raising rents has reached this distant country in england there may be reason for it in a certain degree where the value of lands is increased by accession of commerce and by the rise of the price of provisions but here contrary to all policy the great men begin at the wrong end with squeezing the bag before they have helped the poor tenant to fill it by the introduction of manufactures in many of the isles this already shows its unhappy effect and begins to depopulate the country for numbers of families have been obliged to give up the strong attachment the scots in general have for their country and to exchange it for the wilds of america  the houses of the peasants in lochaber are the most wretched that can be imagined framed of upright poles which are wattled the roof is formed of boughs like a wigwam and the whole is covered with sods so that in this moist climate their cottages have a perpetual and much finer verdure than the rest of the country  salmons are taken in these parts as late as may about  0 tuns are caught in the season these fish never appear so early on this coast as on the eastern  phinocs are taken here in great numbers   00 having been taken at a draught they come in august and disappear in november they are about a foot long their color gray spotted with black their flesh red rise eagerly to a fly

the side of a hill sept   an awefull height above lochleven the country people have a most superstitious desrire of being buried in the little isle of mun in this lough a branch of the sea so narrow as to have only the appearance of a river bounded on both sides with vast mountains among whose winding bottoms the tide rolled in with solemn majesty the scenery begins to grow very romantic on the west side are some woods of birch and pines the hills are very lofty many of them taper to a point and my old friend the late worthy bishop pocock compared the shape of one to mount tabor beneath them

kinlochleven breakfast at the little village of kinlochleven on most excellent minced stag the only form i thought that animal good in  near this village is a single farm fourteen miles long which sets for only     per ann and from the nature of the soil perhaps not very cheap  saw here a quern a quern a sort of portable mill made of two stones about two feet broad thin at the edges and a little thicker in the middle in the center of the upper stone is a hole to pour in the corn and a peg by way of handle the whole is placed on a cloth the grinder pours the corn into the hole with one hand and with the other turns round the upper stone with a very rapid motion while the meal runs out at the sides on the cloth this is rather preserved as a curiosity being much out of use at present such are supposed to be the same with what are common among the moors being the simple substitute of a mill  immediately after leaving kinlochleven the mountains soar to a far greater height than before the sides are covered with wood and the bottoms of the glens filled with torrents that roar amidst the loose stones after a ride of two miles begin to ascend the black mountain the black mountain in argyleshire on a steep road which continues about three miles almost to the summit and is certainly the highest public road in great britain on the other side the descent is scarce a mile

unfurnished  pass near loughtutta a long narrow piece of water with a small pinewood on its side a few weatherbeaten pines and birch appear scattered up and down and in all the bogs great numbers of roots that evince the forest that covered the country within this half century these were the last pines which i saw growing spontaneously in north britain the pineforests are become very rare i can enumerate only those on the banks of loughraynach at invercauld and braemar at coygach and dirrymonach the first in straithnavern the last in sutherland those about loughloyn glenmoriston and straithglas a small one near loughgarrie another near lougharkig and a few scattered trees above kinlochleven all in invernesssire and i was also informed that there are very considerable woods about castle grant i saw only one species of pine in those i visited nor could i learn whether there was any other than what is vulgarly called the scotch fir whose synonyms are these  pinus sylvestris

creature for numbers of miles  the roads are excellent but from fort william to kinlochleven very injudiciously planned often carried far about and often so steep as to be scarce surmountable whereas had the engineer followed the track used by the inhabitants those inconveniences would have been avoided  these roads by rendering the highlands accessible contributed much to their present improvement and were owing to the industry of our soldiery they were begun in      vide p     under the directions of genesis wade who like another hannibal forced his way through rocks supposed to have been unconquerable many of them hang over the mighty lakes of the country and formerly afforded no other road to the natives than the paths of sheep or goats where even the highlander crawled with difficulty and kept himself from tumbling into the far subjacent water by clinging to the plants and bushes of the rock many of these rocks were too hard to yield to the pickax and the miner was obliged to subdue their obstinacy with gunpowder and often in places where nature had denied him footing and where he was forced to begin his labors suspended from above by ropes on the face of the horrible precipice the bogs and moors had likewise their difficulties to overcome but all wore it length constrained to yield to the perseverence of our troops  in some places i observed that after the manner of the romans they left engraven on the rocks the names of the regiment each party belonged to who were employed in these works nor were they less worthy of being immortalized than the vexillatios of the roman legions for civilization was the consequence of the labors of both  these roads begin at dunkeld are carried on through the noted pass of killicrankie by blair to dalnacardoch dalwhinie and over the coryarich to fort augustus a branch extends from thence eastward to inverness and another westward over highbridge to fort william from the last by kinlochleven over the black mountain by the kings house to teindrum and from thence by glenurqhie to inveraray and so along the beautiful boundaries of loughlomond to its extremity  another road begins near crief passes by aberfeldy crosses the tay at taybridge and unites with the other road at dalnacardoch and from dalwhinie a branch passes through badenoch to inverness  these are the principal military roads but there may be many others i may have overlooked  rode through some little vales by the side of a small river and from the appearance of fertility have some relief from the dreary scene of the rest of the day

planted with several sorts of trees such as weymouth pines etc and after a picturesque ride reach  inveraray inveraray the castle the principal seat of the dukes of argyle chief of the campbells was built by duke archibald is quadrangular with a round tower at each corner and in the middle rises a square one glazed on every side to give light to the staircase and galleries and has from without a most disagreeable effect in the attic story are eighteen good bed chambers the groundfloor was at this time in a manner unfurnished but will have several good apartments the castle is built of a coarse lapis llris brought from the other side of loughfine and is the same kind with that found in norway of which the king of denmarks palace at copenhagen is built near the new castle are some remains of the old  this place will in time be very magnificent but at present the space between the front and the water is disgraced with the old town composed of the most wretched hovels that can be imagined the founder of the castle designed to have built a new founder on the west side of the little bay the house stands on he finished a few houses a customhouse and an excellent inn his death interrupted the completion of the plan which when brought to perfection will give the place a very different appearance to what it now bears  from the top of the great rock duniquaich is a fine view of the castle the lawn sprinkled with fine trees the hills covered with extensive plantations a country fertile in corn bordering the lough and the lough itself covered with boats the trees on the lawn about the castle are said to have been planted by the earl of argyle they thrive greatly for i observed beech from nine to twelve feet and a half in girth pines nine and a lesser maple between seven and eight  but the busy scene of the herringfishery gave no small improvement to the magnificent environs of inveraray every evening the finery is carried on in the night the herring being then in motion some hundreds of boats in a manner covered the surface of loughfine an arm of the sea which from its narrowness and from the winding of its shores has all the beauties of a fresh water lake on the weekdays the cheerful noise of the bagpipe and dance eechoes from on board on the sabbath each boat approaches the land and psalmody and devotion divide the day for the common people of the north are disposed to be religious having the example before them of a gentry untained by luxury and dissipation and being instrusted by a clergy who are active in their duty and who preserve respect amids all the disadvantages of a narrow income  the length of loughfine loughfine from the eastern end to the point of lamond is above thirty scotch mises but its breadth scarce two measured the depth from sixty to seventy fathoms herrings it is noted for the vast shoals of herrings that appear here in july and continue till january the highest season is from september to christmas when near six hundred boats with four men in each are employed a chain of nets is used for several are united of a hundred fathoms in length as the herrings swim at very uncertain depths so the nets are sunk to the depth the shoal is found to take the success therefore depends much on the judgment or good fortune of the fishers in taking their due depths for it often happens that one boat will take multitudes while the next does not catch a single fish which makes the boatmen perpetually enquire of each other about the depth of their nets these are kept up by buoys to a proper pitch the ropes that run through them are fastened with pegs and by drawing up or letting out the rope after taking out the pegs they adjust their situation and then replace them sometimes the fish swim in twenty fathom water sometimes in fifty and oftentimes even at the bottom  it is computed that each boat gets about  0l in the season the fish are either salted and packed in barrels for exportation or sold fresh to the country people two or three hundred horses being brought every day to the waterside from very distant parts a barrel holds  00 herrings if they are of the best kind at a medium  00 but if more for sometimes a barrel will hold  000 they are reckoned very poor the present price  l  s per barrel but there is a drawback of the duty on salt for those that are exported  the great rendezvous of vessels for the fishery off the western isles is at cambeltown in cantyre where they clear out on the    th of september and sometimes three hundred busses are seen there at a time they must return to their different ports by january   th where they ought to receive the praemium of  l  0s per tun of herrings but it is said to be very ill paid which is a great discouragement to the fishery  the herrings of loughfine are as uncertain in their migration as they are on the coast of wales they had for numbers of years quitted that water but appeared again there within these dozen years such is the case with the loughs on all this western coast not but people despair too soon of finding them from one or two unsuccessfull trials in the beginning of the season perhaps from not adjusting their nets to the depth the fish happen then to swim in but if each year a small vessel of two was sent to make a thorough trial in every branch of the sea on this coast they would undoubtedly find shoals of fish in one or other  tunnies tunnies br zool illustr    called here mackrelsture are very frequently caught in the herring season which they follow to prey on they are taken with a strong iron hook fastened to a rope and baited with a herring as soon as hooked lose all spirit and are drawn up without any resistance are very active when at liberty and jump and frolic often the surface of the water  sept   crossed over an elegant bridge of three arches upon the array in front of the castle and kept riding along the side of the lough for about seven miles saw in one place a shoal of

bottoms of naked deep and gloomy glens ascend a very high pass with a little lough on the top reach the end of loughlong another narrow arm of the sea bounded by highhills and after a long course terminates in the firth of clyde  near this place see a house very pleasantly situated belonging to colonel campbell amidst plantations with some very fertile bottoms adjacent on ascending a hill not half a mile farther appears loughlomond northbritain may well boast of its waters review of the lakes for so short a ride as thirty miles presents the traveller with the view of four most magnificent pieces loughaw loughfine loughlong and loughlomond two indeed are of salt water but by their narrowness give the idea of fresh water lakes it is an idle observation of travelers that seeing one is the same with seeing all of these superb waters for almost every one i visited has its proper characters  loughleven is a broad expanse with isles and cultivated shores  loughtay makes three bold windings has steep but sloping shores cultivated in many parts and bounded by vast hills  loughraynach is broad and strait has more wildness about it with a large natural pine wood on its southern banks  lough tumel is narrow confined by the sloping sides of steep hills and has on its western limits a flat rich woody country and is watered by a most serpentine stream  the lough of spinie is almost on a flat and its sides much indented  loughmoy is small and has soft features on its banks amidst rude environs  loughness is strait and narrow its shores abound with a wild magnificence lofty precipitous and wooded and has all the greatness of an alpine lake  loughoich has lofty mountains at a small distance from its borders the shores indented and the water decorated with isles  loughlochy wants the isles its shores slope and several straiths terminate on its banks  loughaw is long and waving its little isles tusted with trees and just appearing above the water its two great seeds of water at each extremity and its singular lateral discharge near one of them sufficiently mark this great lake  loughlomond loughlomond the last the most beautiful of the caledonian lakes the first view of it from tarbat presents an extensive serpentine winding amidst lofty hills on the north barren black and rocky which darken with their shade that contracted part of the water near this gloomy tract beneath craig roston mc gregors was the principal seat of the mc gregors a murderous clan infamous for excesses of all kinds it length for a horrible massacre of the colquhuns or cabouns in   0  were proscribed and hunted down like wild beasts their very name suppressed by act of council so that the remnant now dispersed like jews dare not even sign it to any deed their posterity are still said to be distinguished among the clans in which they have incorporated themselves not only by the redness of their hair but by their still retaining the mischievous disposition of their ancestors  on the west side the mountains are clothed hear the bottoms with woods of oak quite to the water edge their summits lofty naked and craggy  on the east side the mountains are equally high but the tops form a more even ridge parallel to the lake except where benlomond its height is    0 feets  like saul amidst his companions overtops the rest the upper parts were black and barren the lower had great marks of fertility or at left of industry for the yellow corn was finely contrasted with the verdure of the groves intermixed with it  this eastern boundary is part of the grampian hills grampian hills which extend from hence through the counties of perth angus mearns and aberdeen they take their name from only a single hill the mons grampius of tacitus where galgacus waited the approach of agricola and where the battle was fought so fatal to the brave caledonians antiquarians have not agreed upon the particular spot but the able mr gordon itin septent    places it near comerie at the upper end

whole the work of the soldiery blessed exchange of instruments of destruction for those that give safety to the traveller and a polish to the once inaccessible native  a great headland covered with trees separates the first scene from one totally different on passing this cape an expanse of water bursts at once on your eye varied with all the softer beauties of nature immediately beneath is a flat covered with wood and corn beyond the headlands stretch far into the water and consist of gentle risings many have their surfaces covered with wood others adorned with trees loosely scattered either over a fine verdure or the purple bloom of the heath numbers of islands are dispersed over the lake of the same elevated form as the little capes and wooded in the same manner others just peep above the surface and are tusted with trees and numbers are so disposed as to form magnificent vistos between  opposite luss at a small distance from shore is a mountainous isle almost covered with wood is near half a mile long and has a most fine effect i could not count the number of islands but was told there are twentyeight the largest two miles long and stocked with deer  the length of this charming lake is    scotch miles its greatest breadth eight its greatest depth a hundred and twenty fathoms besides the fish common to the loughs are guiniads called here poans  the country from luss a tolerable inn on the borders of the lake to the southern extremity of the lake continually improves the mountains sink gradually into small hills the land is highly cultivated well planted and well inhabited  i was struck with rapture at a sight so long new to me it would have been without alloy had it not been dashed with the uncertainty whether the mountain virtue hospitality would flourish with equal vigor in the softer scenes i was on the point of entering on for in the highlands every house gave welcome to the traveller  the vale between the end of the lake and dunbarton is unspeakably beautiful very fertile and finely watered by the great and rapid river levin the discharge of the lake which after a short course drops into the firth of clyde below dunbarton there is scarcely a spot on its banks but what is cultivated with bleacheries plantations and villas nothing can equal the contrast in this days journey between the black barren dreary glens of the morning ride and the soft scenes of the evening islands worthy of the retreat of armida and which rinaldo himself would have quitted with a sigh  before i take my last leave of the highlands entrances into the highlands it would be proper to observe that every entrance into them is strongly marked by nature  on the south the narrow and wooded glen near dunkeld instantly shows the change of country  on the east the craggy pass of bollitir gives a contracted admission into the grampian hills  on the north the mountains near loughmoy appear very near and form what is properly styled the threshold of the country and on the west the narrow road impending over loughlomond forms a most characteristic entrance to this mountainous tract  but the erse language is not confined within these limits for it is spoken on all sides beyond these mountains on the eastern coast it begins at nairn on the western extends over all the isles it ceases in the north of cathness the orkneys and the shetland islands in the shetland isles are still some remains of the norse or old norwegian language  but near loughlomond is heard at luss at buchanan east of the lake and at roseneth west of it  cross the ferry over the levin at bounel and after a ride of three miles reach  dunbarton dunbarton a small but good old town seated on a plain near the conflux of the levin with the firth of clyde it consists principally of one large street in form of a crescent on one side is the tolbooth and at the south end the church with a small spire steeple the waits of the town are bagpipes which go about at nine oclock at night and five in the morning  its catle the castle is seated a little south of the town on a twoheaded rock of a stupendous height rising in a strange manner out of the sands and totally detached from every thing else on one of the summits are the remains of an old lighthouse on the other the powder magazine in the hollow between is a large well of excellent water fourteen feet deep the sides of the rocks are immense precipices and often overhang except on the side where the governors house stands which is defended by walls and a few cannon and garrisoned by a few invalids from its natural strength it was in former times deemed impregnable so that the desperate but successful scalado of it      robertsons hist scotland ii    octavo guthries vii     may vie with the greatest attempts of that kind with the capture of the numidian fortress in the jugurthine war by marius or the more horrible surprise of fescamp sullys memoirs vol i book vi  by the gallant boisrose  from the summits of this rock is a fine view of the country of the town of dunbarton the river levin the firth of clyde the glota of tacitus here about a mile broad and of the towns of greenock and port glasgow on the opposite shore the business of this country is the spinning of thread which is very considerable there is also a great salmonfishery fish but in this populous country so great is the demand for them that none can be spared for curing gilses come up the river in june and continue in plenty about twenty days and many salmon trout are taken from march to july phinocs called here yellow fins come in july and continue about the same space of time as the gilses the fishermen call them the young of some great sea trout during may parrs appear in such numbers in the levin that the water seems quite animated with them there are besides in that river perch and a few poans at dunbarton i was informed by persons ot credit that swallows have often been taken in midwinter in a torpid state out of the steeple of the church and also out of a sandbank over the river endrick near loughlomond   pass by the ruins of dunglas castle sept   near the banks of the clyde which meanders finely along a rich plain full of barley and oats and much enclosed with good hedges a rarity in north britain  at a distance are some gentle risings interspersed with woods and villas belonging to the citizens of glasgow  glasgow the best built of any modern secondrate city i ever saw the houses of stone and in a good taste the principal street runs east and west and is near a mile and a half long but unfortunately is not strait the tolbooth is large and handsome next to that is the exchange within is a spacious room with fulllength portraits of all our monarchs since james i and an excellent one by ramsay of archibald duke of argyle in a judges robe before the exchange is a large equestrian statue of king william this is the broadest and finest part of the street many of the houses are built over piazzas but too narrow to be of much service to walkers numbers of other streets cross this at right angles and are in general well built  market places the marketplaces are great ornaments to this city the fronts being done in a very fine taste and the gates adorned with columns of one or other of the orders some of these markets are for meal greens fish or flesh there are two for the last which have conduits out of several of the pillars so that they are constantly kept sweet and clean  near the mealmarket is a public grainary to be filled on any apprehension of scarceness  the guardhouse is in the great street which is kept by the inhabitants who regularly do duty an excellent police is observed here and proper officers attend the markets to prevent any abuses  the old bridge over the clyde consists of eight arches and was built  00 years ago by bishop rea two others are now building the tide flows three miles higher up the country but at low water is fordable there is a plan for deepening the channel for at present the tide brings up only very small vessels and the ports belonging to this city lie fourteen miles lower at port glasgow and greenock on the west side of the firth  near the bridge is a large almshouse a vast nailery a stoneware manufacture and a great porter brewery which supplies some part of unindustrious ireland within fight on the south side are collieries and much coal is exported into the lastmentioned island and into america  the great imports of this city are tobacco and sugar of the former trade above  0000 hogsheads have been annually imported and near  0000 again exported into france the manufactures here are linnens cambricks the greatest cambrick manufacture is now at paisly a few miles from this city  lawns tapes sustians and striped linnens so that it already begins to rival manchester and has in point of the convenience of its ports in respect to america a great advantage over it  the college is a large building with a handsome front to the street college resembling some of the old colleges in oxford charles i subscribed  00  toward this work but was prevented by the troubles from paying it but cromwell afterward fulfilled the design of the royal donor it was founded in    0 by james ii pope nicholas i gave the bull but bishop turnbull supplied the money there are about  00 students belonging to the college who lodge in the town but the professors have good houses in the college young gentlemen of fortune have private tutors who have an eye to their conduct the rest live entirely at their own discretion  the library is a very handsome room with a gallery round it supported by pillars that beneficent nobleman the late duke of chandos when he visited the college gave  00l toward building this apartment  messrs robert and andrew faulis printers and booksellers to the university have instituted an academy for painting and engraving and like good citizens zealous to promote the welfare and honor of their native place have at vast expense formed a most numerous collection of paintings from abroad in order to form the taste of their cleves  the printing is a very considerable branch of business and has long been celebrated for the beauty of the types and the correctness of the editions here are preserved in cases numbers of monumental and other stones several have been engraven by the artists of the academy the provost of the university did me the honor of presenting me with a set  taken out of the walls on the roman stations in this part of the kingdom some are well cut and ornamented most of them were done to perpetuate the memory of the vexillatio or party who performed such or such works others in memory of officers who died in the country  the cathedral is a large pile churches now divided into two churches beneath and deep under ground is another in which is also divine service where the congregation may truly say clamavi e profundis the roof is fine made of stone and supported by pillars but the beauty much hurt by the crowding of the pews near this is the ruin of the castle or bishops palace  the new church is a very handsome building with a large elegant porch but the outside is much dissigured by a slender square tower with a pepperbox top and in general the steeples of glasgow are in a remarkable bad taste being in fact no favorite part of architecture with the church of scotland the inside of that just spoken of is most neatly finished supported by pillars and very prettily stuccoed it is one of the very few exceptions to the slovenly and indecent manner in which presbitery keeps the houses of god reformation in matters of religion seldom observes mediocrity here it was outrageous for a place of worship commonly neat was deemed to savor of popery but to avoid the imputation of that extreme they run into another for in many parts of scotland our lord seems still to be worshipped in a stable and often in a very wretched one many of the churches are thatched with heath and in some places are in such bad repair as to be half open at top so that the people appear to worship as the druids did of old in open temples  went

as it is called here is seated at the end of a small town is a large disagreeable pile of building with two deep wings at right angles with the center the gallery is of great extent and furnished as well as some other rooms with most excellent paintings that of daniel in the lions den by rubens is a great performance the fear and devotion of the prophet is finely expressed by his uplifted face and eyes his clasped hands his swelling muscles and the violent extension of one foot a lion looks fiercely at him with open mouth and seems only restrained by the almighty power from making him fall a victim to his hunger and the signal deliverance of daniel is more fully marked by the number of human bones scattered over the floor as if to show the instant fate of others in whose favor the deity did not interfere  the marriage feast by paul veronese is a fine piece and the obstinacy and resistance of the intruder who came without the wedding garment is strongly expressed  the treaty of peace between england and spain in the reign of james i by juan de pantoxa is a good historical picture there are six envoys on the part of the spaniards and five on that of the english with their names inscribed over each the english are the earls of dorset nottingham devonshire northampton and robert cecil  earls of lauderdale and lanerk settling the covenant both in black with faces full of

precipitous rock within its walls was the palace of several of the scotch kings a square building ornamented on three sides with pillars resting on grotesque figures projecting from the wall and on the top of each pillar is a statue seemingly the work of fancy near it is the old parlementhouse a vast room   0 feet long very high with a timbered roof and formerly had a gallery running round the inside below the castle are the ruins of the palace belonging to the earls of mar whose family had once the keeping of this fortress there are still the erskine arms and much ornamental carving on parts of it the town of stirling is enclosed with a wall the sterling castle streets are irregular and narrow except that which leads to the castle here and at the village of bannockbourne is a

mile from falkirk and are the greatest of the kind in europe they were founded about eight years ago before which there was not a single house and the country a mere moor at present the buildings of all sorts are of vast extent and above twelve hundred men are employed the iron is smelted from the stone then cast into cannon pots and all sorts of utensils made in sounderies this work has been of great service to the country by teaching the people industry and a method of setting about any sort of labor which before the common people had scarce any notion of  carron wharf lies on the forth and

restored to two innocent prattlers after an absence equally regretted by all parties  appendix number i concerning the constitution of the church of scotland presbyterian government in scotland took place after the reformation of popery as being the form of ecclesiastical government most agreeable to the genius and inclinations of the people of scotland when james vi succeeded to the crown of england it is well known that during his reign and that of his successors of the family of stewart designs were formed of altering the constitution of our civil government and rendering our kings more absolute the establishment of episcopacy in scotland was thought to be one point proper in order to facilitate the execution of these designs episcopacy was accordingly established at length and continued to be the government of the church till the revolution when such designs subsisting no longer presebyterian government was restored to scotland it was established by act of parliament in    0 and was afterward secured by an express article in the treaty of union between the two kingdoms of england and scotland among the ministers of scotland there subsists a perfect equality that is no minister considered as an individual has an authoratative jurisdiction over another jurisdiction is competent for them only when they act in a collective body or as a court of judicature and then there is a subordination of one court to another or inferior and superior courts  the courts established by law are the four following viz church sessions presbyteries provincial synods and above all a national or general assembly  a church session is composed of the minister of the parish and certain discreet laymen who are chosen and ordained for the exercise of discipline and are called elders the number of these elders varies according to the extent of the parish two of them together with the minister are necessary in order to their holding a legal meeting the minister always presides in these meetings and is called moderator but has no other authority but what belongs to the praeses of any other court the church session is appointed for inspecting the morals of the parishioners and managing the funds that are appropriated for the maintenance of the poor within their bounds when a person is convided of any instance of immoral conduct or of what is inconsistent with his christian profession the church session inflicts some ecclesiastical censure such as giving him an admonition or rebuke or if the crime be of a gross and public nature they appoint him to profess his repentance in face of the whole congregation in order to make satisfaction for the public offense the highest church censure is excommunication which is seldom inflicted but for contumacy or for some very atrocious crime obstinately persisted in in former times there were certain civil pains and penalties which followed upon a sentence of excommunication but by a british statute these are happily abolished the church of scotland addresses its censures only to the consciences of men and if they cannot by the methods of persuasion reclaim offenders they think it inconsistent with the spirit of true religion to have recourse to compulsive methods such as temporal pains and penalties  if the person thinks himself aggrieved by the church session it is competent for him to seek redress by entering an appeal to the presbytery which is the next superior court in like manner he may appeal from the presbytery to the provincial synod and from the synod to the assembly whose sentence is final in all ecelesiastical matters  a presbytery consists of the ministers within a certain district and also of one ruling elder from each church session within the district in settling the boundaries of a presbytery a regard was paid to the situation of the country where the country is populous and champaign there are instances of thirty ministers and as many elders being joined in one presbytery in mountainous countries where traveling is more difficult there are only seven or eight ministers in some places fewer in a presbytery the number of presbyteries is computed to he about seventy presbyteries review the procedure of church sessions and judge in references and appeals that are brought before them they take trials of candidates for the ministry and if upon such trial they had them duly qualified they license them to preach but not to dispense the sacraments such licentiates are called probationers it is not common for the church of scotland to ordain or confer holy orders on such licentiates till they be presented to some vacant kirk and thereby acquire a right to a benefice  it is the privilege of presbyteries to judge their own members at least in the first instance they may be judged for herefy that is for preaching or publishing doctrines that are contrary to the public standard imposed by act of parliament and assembly or for any instance of immoral conduct prosecutions for heresy were formerly more frequent than they are at present but happily a more liberal spirit has gained ground among the clergy of scotland they think more freely than they did of old and consequently a spirit of inquiry and moderation seems to be on the growing hand so that prosecutions for herefy are become more rare and are generally looked upon as invidious some sensible men among the clergy of scotland look upon subscriptions to certain articles and creeds of human composition as a grievance from which they would willingly be delivered  presbyteries are more severe in their censures upon their own members for any instance of immoral conduct if the person be convicted they suspend him from the exercise of his ministerial office for a limited time but if the crime be of a heinous nature they depose or deprive him of his clerical character so that he is no longer a minister of the church of scotland but forfeits his title to his benefice and other privileges of the established church however if the person thinks himself injured by the sentence of the presbytery it is lawful for him to appeal to the provincial synod within whose bounds his presbytery lies and from the synod he may appeal to the national assembly presbyteries hold their meetings generally every month except in remote countries and have a power of adjourning themselves to whatever time or place within their district they shall think proper they choose their own praeses or moderator who must be a minister of their own presbytery the ruling elders who sit in presbyteries must be changed every halfyear or else chosen again by their respective church sessions  provincial synods are the next superior courts to presbyteries and are composed of the several presbyteries within the province and of a ruling elder from each church session the ancient dioceses of the bishops are for the most part the boundaries of a synod most of the synods in scotland meet twice every year in the months of april and october and at every meeting they choose their praeses or moderator who must be a clergyman of their own number they review the procedure of presbyteries and judge in appeals references and complaints that are brought before them from the inferior courts and if a presbytery shall be found negligent in executing the ecclesiastical laws against any of their members or any other person within their jurisdiction the synod can call them to account and censure them as they shall see cause  the general assembly is the supreme court in ecclesiastical matters and from which there lies no appeal as they have a power of making jaws and canons concerning the discipline and government of the church and the public service of religion the king sends always a commissioner to represent his royal person that nothing may be enacted inconsistent with the laws of the state the person who represents the king is generally some scots nobleman whom his majesty nominates annually some time before the meeting of the assembly and is allowed a suitable salary for defraying the expense of this honorable office he is present at all the meetings of the assembly and at all their debates and deliberations after the assembly is constituted he presents his commission and delivers a speech and when they have finished their business which they commonly do in twelve days he adjourns the assembly and appoints the time and place of their next annual meeting which is generally at edinburgh in the month of may  the assembly is composed of ministers and ruling elders chosen annually from each presbytery in scotland as the number of ministers and elders in a presbytery varies so the number of their representatives must hold a proportion to the number of ministers and elders that are in the presbytery the proportion is fixed by laws and regulations for that purpose each royal burgh and university in scotland has likewise the privilege of choosing a ruling elder to the assembly all elections must at least be made forty days before the meeting of the assembly their jurisdiction is either constitutive or judicial by the first they have authority to make laws in ecclesiastical matters by the other they judge in references and appeals brought before them from the subordinate courts and their sentences are decisive and final one point which greatly employs their attention is the settlement of vacant parishes the common people of scotland are greatly prejudiced against the law of patronage hence when a patron presents a candidate to a vacant parish the parishioners frequently make great opposition to the settlement of the presentee and appeal from the inferior courts to the assembly the assembly nowadays are not disposed to indulge the parishioners in unreasonable opposition to presentees on the other hand they are unwilling to settle the presentee in opposition to the whole people who refuse to submit to his ministry because in this case his ministrations among them must be useless and without effect the assembly therefore for the most part delay giving sentence in such cases till once they have used their endeavors to reconcile the parishioners to the presentee but if their attempts this way prove unsuccessful they proceed to settle the presentee in obedience to the act of parliament concerning patronages upon the whole it appears that in the indicatories of the church of scotland there is an equal representation of the laity as of the clergy which is a great security to the laity against the usurpations of the clergy  the business of every minister in a parish is to perform religious worship and to preach in the language of the country to his congregation every sunday and likewise on other extraordinary occasions appointed by the laws and regulations of the church the tendency of their preaching is to instruct their hearers in the essential doctrines of natural and revealed religion and improve these instructions in order to promote the practice of piety and social virtue of old it was customary to preach upon controverted and mysterious points of divinity but it is now hoped that the generality of the clergy confine the subject of their preaching to what has a tendency to promote virtue and good morals and to make the people peaceable and useful members of society  ministers likewise examine their parishioners annually they go to the different towns and i must observe that bishop burnet by birth a scotchman adopted in his diocese the zeal of the church of his native country and its attention to the morals and good conduct of the clergy and their flocks not content with the usual triennial visitations he every summer during six weeks made a progres through some district of his diocese preaching and confirming from church to church so that before the return of the triennial visitation he became well acquainted with the behavior of every incumbent he preached every sunday in some church of the city of salisbury catechized and instrncted its youth for confirmation was most vigilant and strict in his examination of candidates for holy orders was an invincible enemy to pluralities and of course to nonresidents filled his office with worth and dignity and by his espiscopal merits it is to be hoped may have atoned for the acknowledged blemishes in his biographical character villages of the parish and in an easy and familiar manner converse with them upon the essential doctrines of religion they make trial of their knowledge by putting questions to them on these heads the adult as well as children are catechized they likewise visit their parishes and inquire into the behavior of their several parishioners and admonish them for whatever they find blameable in their conduct at these visitations the minister inculcates the practice of the relative and social duties and insists upon the necessity of the practice of them and if there happen to be any quarrels among neighbors the minister endeavors by the power of persuasion to bring about a reconciliation but in this part of their conduct much depends upon the temper prudence and discretion of ministers who are clothed with the same passions prejudices and infirmities that other men are  to this sensible account of the church of north britain i beg leave to add another which may be considered as a sort of supplement and may serve to sling light on some points untouched in the preceding it is the extract from an answer to some queries i sent a worthy correspondent in the highlands to whom i am indebted for many sensible communications  to apprehend well the present state of our church patronage and mode of settlement we must briefly view this matter from the reformation at that remarkable period the whole temporalities of the church were resumed by the crown and parliament and soon after a new maintenance was settled for ministers in about   0 parishes the patrons of the old splendid popish livings still claimed a patronage in the newmodelled poor stipends for parish ministers the lords or gentlemen who got from the crown grants of the superiorities and lands of old abbeys claimed also the patronage of all the churches which were in the gift of those abbeys during popery the king too claimed the old patronage of the crown and those of any ecclesiaslic corporations not granted away  laypatronages were reckoned always a great grievance by the church of scotland and accordingly from the beginning of the reformation the church declared against laypatronage and presentations the ecclesiastic laws of acts of assembly confirmed at last by parliament required in order to the settlement of a minister some concurrence of the congregation of the gentlemen who had property within the cure and of the elders of the parish  the elders or kirksession are a number of persons who for their wisdom piety and knowledge are elected from the body of the people in every parish and continue for life sese been gerentibus to assist the parish minister in suppressing immoralities and regulating the affairs of the parish three of these men and a minister make a quorum and form the lowest of our church courts  thus matters continued to the year      when by act of parliament patronages were abolished entirely and the election or nomination of ministers was committed to the kirksession or elders who in those days of universal sobriety and outward appearance at least of religion among the presbyteriaris were generally the gentlemen of il best condition in the parish who were in communion with the church after the restoration of king charles ii along with episcopacy patronages returned yet under the old laws and all debates were finally determinate by the general assembly which even under episcopacy in scotland was the supreme ecclesiastic court thus they continued till the revolution when the presbyterian model was restored by act of parliament  the people chose their own ministers and matters continued in this form till the year      when queen annes ministry intending to defeat the hanover successon took all methods to harass such as were firmly attached to it which the presbyterian gentry and clergy ever were both from principle and interest an act therefore was obtained and which is still in force restoring patrons to their power of electing ministers  by this act the king is now in possession of the patronage of above  00 churches out of   0 having not only the old rights of the crown but many patronages acquired at the reformation not yet alienated all the patronages of the    scots bishops and all the patronages of the lords and gentlemen forseited in the years      and      lords gentlemen and magistrates of buroughs are the patrons of the remaining churches a patron must present a qualified person to a charge within six months of the last incumbents removal or death otherwise his right falls to the presbytery  a presbytery consists of several ministers and elders all parishes are annexed to some presbytery the presbytery is the second church court and they revise the the acts of the kirksession which is the lowest above the presbytery is the synod which is a court consisting of several presbyteries and from all these there lies an appeal to the general assembly which is the supreme church court in scotland this supreme court consists of the king represented by his commissioner ministers from the different presbyteries and ruling elders they meet annually at edinburgh enact laws for the good of the church finally determine all controverted elections of ministers they can prevent a clergymans transportation from one charge to another they can find a presentee qualified or unqualified and consequently oblige the patron to present another they can depose from the ministry and every intrant into holy orders becomes bound to submit to the decisions of this court which from the days our reformer john knox has appropriated to itself the titles of the very venerable and very reverend assembly of the church of scotland  all the clergymen of our communion are upon a par as to authority we can enjoy no pluralities nonresidence is not known we are bound to a regular discharge of the several duties of our office the different cures are frequently visited by the presbytery of the bounds and at these visitations strict enquiry is made into the life doctrine and diligence of the incumbent and for default in any of these he may be suspended from preaching or if any gross immorality is proved against him he can be immediately deposed and rendered incapable of officiating as a minister of the gospel appeal indeed lies as i said before from the decision of the inferior to the supreme court  great care is taken in preparing young men for the ministry after going through a course of philosophy in one of our four universities they must attend at least for four years the divinityhall where they hear the prelections of the professors and perform the different exercises prescribed them they must attend the greek the hebrew and rhetoric classes and before ever they are admitted to trials for the ministry before a presbytery they must lay testimonials from the different professors of their mortis their attendance their progress before them and if upon trial they are found unqualified they are either set aside as unfit for the office or enjoined to apply to their studies a year or two more  our livings are in general from  0 to   0l sterling some few livings are richer and a few poorer every minister besides is entitled to a mansion house barn and stable to four acres of arable and three of pasturage land our livings are exempted from all public duties as are also our persons from all public statuteworks as schools are erected in all our parishes and that education is cheap our young generation is beginning to imbibe some degree of taste and liberal sentiment unknown to their illiterate rude forefathers the english language is cultivated even here amongst these bleak and dreary mountains your divines your philosophers your historians your poets have found their way to our sequestered vales and are perused with pleasure even by our lowly swains and the names of tittotson of atterbury of clerk of secker of newton of lock of bacon of lyttelton of dryden of pope of gay and of gray are not unknown in our distant land  number ii account of the fading woman of rosshire dunrobin aug         the information of mr rainy missionary  minister in kincardine anent katharine mleod  katharine mleod daughter to donald mleod farmer in croig in the parish of kincardine rosshire an unmarried woman aged about thirtyfive years sixteen years ago contracted a fever after which she became blind her father carried her to several physicians and surgeons to cure her blindness their prescriptions proved of no effect he carried her also to a lady skilled in physic in the neighborhood who doubtful whether her blindness was occasioned by the weakness of her eyelids or a defect in her eyes found by the use of some medicines that the blindness was occasioned by a weakness in her eyelids which being strengthened she recovered her fight in some measure and discharged as usual every kind of work about her fathers farm but tied a garter tight round her forehead to keep up her eyelids in this condition she continued for four or five years enjoying a good state of health and working as usual she contracted another lingering fever of which she never recovered perfectly  some time after her fever her jaws fell her eyelids closed and she lost her appetite her parents declare that for the space of a year and threequarters they could not say that any meat or liquid went down her throat throat being interrogated on this point they owned they very frequently put something into her mouth but they concluded that nothing went down her throat because she had no evacuation and when they forced open her jaws at one time and kept them open for some time by putting in a stick between her teeth and pulled forward her tongue and forced something down her throat me coughed and strained as if in danger to be choked one thing during the time she eat and drank nothing is remarkable that her jaws were unlocked and she recovered her speech and retained it for several days without any apparent cause for the same she was quite sensible repeated several questions of the shorter catechisms told them that it was to no purpose to put any thing into her mouth for that nothing went down her throat as also that sometimes she understood them when they spoke to her by degrees her jaws thereafter fell and she lost her speech  some time before i few her she received some sustenance whey watergruel etc but threw it up at least for the most part immediately when they put the stick between her teeth mentioned above two or three of her teeth were broken it was at this breach they put in any thing into her mouth i caused them to bring her out of bed and give her something to drink they gave her whey her neck was contraded her chin fixed on her breast nor could by any force be pulled back she put her chin and mouth into the dish with the whey and i perceived she sucked it at the abovementioned breach as a child would suck the breast and immediately threw it up again as her parents told me she used to do and she endeavored with her hand to dry her mouth and chin her forehead was contracted and wrinkled her cheeks full red and blooming her parents told me that she slept a great deal and soundly perspired sometimes and now and then emitted pretty large quantities of blood at her mouth  for about two years past they have been wont to carry her to the door once every day and she would show signs of uneasiness when they neglected it at the usual time last sumsummer after giving her to drink of the water of the weil of strathconnen she crawled to the door on her hands and feet without any help she is at present in a very languid way and still throws up what she drinks  number iii parallel roads in glenroy all the description that can be given of the parallel roads or terrasses is that the glen of itself is extremely narrow and the hills on each side very high and generally not rocky in the face of these hills both sides of the glen there are three roads at small distances from each other and directly opposite on each side these roads have been measured in the compleatest parts of them and found to be    paces of a man five feet ten inches high the two highest are pretty near each other about  0 yards and the lowest double that distance from the nearest to it they are carried along the sides of the glen with the utmost regularity nearly as exact as drawn with a line of rule and compass  where deep burns or gullies of water cross these roads they avoid both the descent and ascent in a very curious manner so that on the side where the road enters those hollows they rather ascend along the slope and descend the opposite side until they come to the level without the traveller being sensible of ascent or descent there are other smaller glens falling into this glenroy the parallel roads surround all these smaller ones but where glenroy ends in the open country there are not the smallest vestiges of them to be seen the length of these roads in glenroy are about seven miles there are other two glens in that neighborhood where these roads are equally visible called glengluy and glenspean the former running northwest and the latter south from glenroy both these roads are much about the same length as glenroy  it is to be observed that these roads are not causeway but levelled out of the earth there are some small rocks though few in the course of these roads people have examined in what manner they made this passage through the rocks and find no vestige of roads in the rock but they begin on each side and keep the regular line as formerly so far i am indebted to mr trapaud governor of fort augustus  i cannot learn to what nation the inhabitants of the country attribute these roads i was informed that they were inaccessible at the east end open at the west or that nearest to the sea and that there were no traces of buildings or druidical remains in any part that could lead us to suspect that they were designed for oeconomical or religious purposes the country people think they were designed for the chase and that these terrasses were made after the spots were cleared in lines from wood in order to tempt the animals into the open paths after they were rouzed in order that they might come within reach of the bowmen who might conceal themselves in the woods above and below ridings for the sportsmen are still common in all great forests in france and other countries on the continent either that they might pursue the game without interruption of trees or shoot at it in its passage  mr gordon p     of his itinerary mentions such terrasses to the number of seventeen or eighteen raised one above the other in the most regular manner for the space of a mile on the side of a hill in the county of tweedale near a village called romana and also near two small roman camps they are from fifteen to twenty feet broad and appear at four or five miles distance not unlike a great amphitheatre the same gentleman also has observed similar terrasses near other camps of the same nation from whence he suspects them to be works of the romans and to have been thrown up by their armies for itinerary encampments such may have been their use in those places but what could have been the object of the contrivers of the terrasses of glenroy where it is more than probable those conquerors never came remains a mystery except the conjecture above given should prove satisfactory  number iv galic proverbs   leaghaidh a choir am beul an anmbuinn  justice itself melts away in the

beautiful drawings of the pillars the lesser pillar engraven with these is by tradition of the country thought to belong to these but mr farish thinks it is at too great a distance from them to admit of that supposition its height is six feet in penrith churchyard one was communicated to me by the rev mr farish of carlisle and represents them in their present state the other by the rev mr monkhouse fellow of queens college oxford which is a view of them before they were mutilated the first is certainly a most authentic representation of them the last varies in many particulars from the form they now appear in in that the columns are drawn entirely square from top to bottom whereas the lower part of the pillars now extant are rounded there is no fretwork on the old drawing of these columns but instead are two small rude figures of human heads the thin semicircular stones are deeply and regularly indented on their edges which appear of an equal thickness throughout whereas the others are very sharp or ridged at one extremity and dilate gradually till they arrive at a considerable thickness at the other the figures in the old sketch are of a boar and perhaps a bear the upper ends of these pillars seem faithfully to supply what has been destroyed a cross and a capital  how this great variation in the drawings of the same columns happened is not easy to say for it does not appear that there ever were any others in the place time has obliterated the figures of the animals but whether any workman had chizzled the whole shafts of the pillars to their present form is i think scarcely to be conjectured they bear all the appearance of antiquity the old drawings are done with much elegance and are copied from some collections in the custody of mr monkhouse formed by hugh todd d d prebendary of carlisle and vicar of penrith as materials for the antiquities of the diocese he belonged to notwithstanding my doubts about the entire fidelity of the old drawing which was done about the year    0 i cause it to be engraven as a companion to the other in hopes that some antiquarian of the country will oblige the public by clearing up the point  by mr monkhouses permission i annex doctor todds account of these antiquities  at the north door of the church are erected two large stone pillars of a pyramidical form cruciated toward the top each of them fifteen feet high and placed at the distance of seventeen feet from each other the space between them is surrounded with the rude figures of four boars or wild hogs what this monument denotes and for what reason it was first erected may be somewhat uncertain the common vulgar report is that one ewen or owen coesarius a very extraordinary person famous in these parts for hunting and fighting about   00 years ago whom no hand but the hand of death could overcome lies buried in this place his stature as the story lays was prodigious beyond that of the patagons in south america viz fifteen feet that the two pillars denote his height and the four ough unpolished stones betwixt represent so many wild boars which had the honor to be killed by this wonderful giant that there might be in remote times in these regions men of large gi gantick figures as there are now near the magellanic streights and that they might affect roman sirnames and distinctions as the americans about darieen do spanish needs not either be discussed or denied but those persons give the best account of the original nature and design of these stones who look upon them as of a much later date and for a very different intention that they were erected long after the introduction of christianity at the north or deaths door of the church in the form of a cross in order to rest the bodies of the dead upon them and to pray for their souls as the manner was and that the four figures of boars are the cognizance the bear and raggedstaff was but i do not recollect that the boars had any thing to do with the earls of warwick but as boars and bears are represented on the stones it seems as if this mr caesarius was a knighterrant who cleared the country of monsters so in memorial of his exploits these figures were engraven the heads too might have been cut on the columns in memory of some petty tyrants of the neighborhood whom he had demolished for such bloody trophies were in former days very common witness among the welsh the tripen sais or three englishmens heads borne in the arms of many of our families as a token of the prowess of their ancesters of the earls of warwick some of whom held the seigniory of penrith and lived in the castle and might be at the expense of the work  pillars in penrith church yard   a recapitulation of the animals mentioned in the tour with some additional

stronger in proportion to their longevity it feeds during summer on grass and is remarkably fond of the rubas saxatilis called in the highlands on that account the roebuck berry when the ground is covered with snow it feeds on the extreme branches of the pine and juniper it brings two young at a time the fawns are elegantly spotted with white it is extremely difficult to rear them commonly
