a postscript to john bull containing the history of the crowninn with the death of the widow and what happened thereon  the sixth edition  london printed for j moor and sold by the booksellers of london and westminster price   d  the history etc you desire me to give you some account of the death of the widow at the crowninn in the metropolis of this country and how affairs have gone since you left the place  the widow you know was a good sort of a woman she was pious and charitable and did a great deal of good among her poor neighbors went constantly to the parish church on sundays and in general had the character of a conscientious motherly woman  her husband whilst he lived was one of the honestest men breathing it is true he would take his glass in company as all his countrymen will do but he was a downright honest fellow and loved the town and we shall never forget how tightly he stood by  when sir jacob our high sheriff would have infringed on our right of commoning poor man he kept her from ill advice whilst he lived and the whole country was heartily sorry for his death having not left an honester man behind him in the parish  but what need i tell you things which you are as well acquainted with as my self only to refresh your memory in some passages previous to your request you desire to know the disposition of the estate and how the three farms stand affected at this day  you remember at her first coming to the house she found the debts of an old lawsuit to be paid which had lasted long and a new one just ready to begin which no body could guess the event of money there was little or none in the house and only a few exchequer notes which no body but the exciseman would take for ready money  her tenants and customers were very unwilling to see her ruined and as she had treated them very handsomely at her housewarming they swore they would stand by her against all opposers by opposers you know who they meant for it was by this time certainly known that old savage the extortioner had set up a competitor against her pretending he was a real branch of the ancient family of the shutes formerly lords of the manor and brought a writ of ejectment in his name and feed council against the widow this savage is one who has always made it his business to entertain renegadoes and impostors and by forged deeds and wills to take possession of estates and then maintain them by trouble some law suits till at last he has shared a handsome composition for himself you cannot choose too but know that both by will and deed of gift the house it self as well as the three farms had been settled on her near kinsman mr wright a man whom all the honest tenants wished to succeed her as well in her life as in the time of her predecessor  to be short as you must needs know a hazardous suit commenced and because it should not lie too hard upon the widow many of her friends became parties to it honest john trusty by general consent was made chief agent in the cause who the first term put the widows affairs in a good posture and for several terms following was continually gaining one advantage or other over her adversaries so that they began now to sue for composition and a meeting was appointed on both sides but refusing to allow sufficient costs and damages the law went on  in this promising state stood affairs when that furious pulpiteer the curate of highham came to preach at hockley where having packed up a sermon for the purpose he infused sedition among the widows tenants and customers insinuating that she began to sell in short measure brewed with homemade malt and let her lawyers bookkeepers ostlers chamberlain tapster etc run away with what should pay the excise he inveighed vehemently against the parson of the parish and other heads of tke town for not repairing the church one part of which he said was damaged and ready to fall whilst the conventicle was upheld by some about her and a parcel of gypsies kept privately in the barn to eat her out of house and home  the fellow had a good talent at railing and could run on with as much impudence as a mountebank exhibits his packet in short the poison worked so subtly that the whole country was put in a ferment the curate was taken up and brought before the bench of justices where though he was reprimanded and ordered to find sureties for his good behavior for   years yet it did not quiet the people who cried out the church the church and ran up and down in tumults as though it had been falling on their heads whilst to strengthen the matter the curate took a journey round the country possessing the people that the house was haunted and bid them take care how they came near it any more directing them to the popes head and dagger near the cross  at this time one robin slyboots a welsh buttonmaker a notorious cunning fellow and famed for a conjurer who had formerly belonged to the family but was turned out for making too bold with the widows secrets this fellow took his opportunity to corrupt one of the widows maids by pretending to tell her her fortune which such gigling wenches are generally fond of so that taking her one day as she was sweeping the rooms and making the beds he began in this manner   nab says he i have often taken notice that thou art a painstaking industrious girl and have lived a great while in thy service without coming to any advancement it is true you sweep the rooms make the beds and get a little sorry vails of the guests but it is mrs sarah runs away with all the profit and keeps her whole family at your mistresses charge but though she now flouts the widow and flies and bounces like bottled ale thou shall one day if thou take my advice come to be as high as she remember it nab i say thou shall come to be a lady  bless me says nab with a simpering countenance knowing he had long had the reputation of a conjurer is it possible that i should come to such preferment as you say that you may believe me says robin go presently and look on the bed in the green room there lies a calicoe gown and peticoat lined through with the same ask your mistress for it and she will give it you as you find this true believe me in the rest  nab no longer able to contain her self flung down her besom and ran to the place where finding it as he had said she returned overjoyed  but mr slyboots says nab how is this thing to be effected i will tell you says robin  at midnight when all things are quiet you shall plant me in some corner and for the greater solemnity i will have my conjurers gown on you must on your part infuse strange things into her head and tell her as many tales as you can of the servants then bring in some talk of the curate tell her what a good man he is and that he had always a great respect for her insinuate that the design of bringing him before the bench of justices was to disgrace the church and that those who were his friends she may assure her self are hers and whilst she is musing on these things for i know it will work on her religious spirit i will appear and then leave the rest to me  nab in the mean time had got the gown and peticoat which robin spoke of and was pretty sure the rest of his predictions would follow in fine the widow was so possessed and deluded by nabs whining and this conjuring rascals cant that though otherwise a woman of sense she grew perfectly enflamed so that without examining farther into the matter giving ear to nabs tales she presently began to reform her family and a great many of the honestest tenants had warning given them against the next quarterday however the lawsuit continuing they did not yet think fit to turn out honest john the agent because the taking the papers out of his hands might be dangerous to the cause  among the rest to make room for robin ralph the cashkeeper was dismissed a downright honest fellow and had held his place long with great integrity though many of her best customers told her they would leave the house and stand by her no longer if she took these courses but all did not avail every thing went as robin advised in fine she turned away all her old honest servants dissolved the club that was kept at her house and none were held in favor but such as had appeared to be friends to the curate or were robins creatures robin was first made bookkeeper and undercashkeeper and after headcashkeeper which was what he all along aimed at he grew angry now at being called plain robin and nothing would go down but mr slyboots at every word he changed his sign which was before the three buttonmoles and hung up in the room of it the star and garter finely painted and had vanity and impudence enough to take the two angels for supporters to his signpost all that he said or did if it may bear an old pun was bob as a robin he brought in all his friends fellows as poor as howlets to rule the roast and fill their hungry bellies at the widows table such an avaritious crew as were hardly worth hanging a medley of welsh cratecarriers pedlars retalers of hobnails brickdust etc and among the rest advanced harry aucumy the brazier an audacious lewd young fellow to be one of the clerks of the brew house this was a docible young dog for robins purpose and by a pert way of speaking in the club dexterously advanced the reputation of robins proceedings in short all went swimmingly in the inn for a year or two and the rogues with thriving faces caressed one another in their iniquity  but they found the lawsuit began to hang heavy on their hands they had not the same credit that the former servants had to borrow money and they had none of their own to lend the rino was wanted to pay fees and the tenants were very backward to advance more so that finding they were like to bring an old house upon their heads if they went on they were resolved at any rate to come to an accommodation and harry aucumy was sent privately to old savages house to treat about it though they had still told the tenants it should be pushed on vigorously next term and constantly got money out of them for that purpose  thinking their business was now done they put honest john trusty out of the agency and like a parcel of ungrateful curs set their black guard to pelt him but the honest people of the town could not forbear expressing their love in respect to his upright and judicious dealing by welcoming him home with loud acclamations which fretted the rogues to the plucks to see him so caressed by whose good management the cause had been brought to that issue that judgment was ordered to be entered up and execution would certainly have followed the very next term it will be tedious to relate all the intricate passages of the law and how the widows friends resolved to carry the cause on without her but that robin had ordered the new agent jacob rush to stifle many of the chief witnesses by which the adversarys attorney found means to stop judgment  to amuse the tenants who they knew would be alarmed at this proceeding it was given out that the widows friends had not paid their share of the lawcharges but that all the burden had lain upon her which had run her grievously in debt and that she was in a manner forced to a composition and had offers now of a very good one much to the advantage of her self and her friends this took with the silly people and in spite of all the entreaties of her honest tenants an agreement soon followed which however had taken up more time and money to effect than would have decided it at common law  it is true we burnt our faggotstacks set the bells a ringing and illumined our windows but we soon experienced that humiliation would have become us better the house lost its trade and no body in town almost had any thing to do people began to see into this when it was too late and no remedy could be found to help them our old friends exclaimed against us as a treacherous and base sort of people and shunned the town and our new ones apparently slighted us though we had done them such signal service nor could we so much as obtain to have the quarter sessions kept here though our credit before used to draw every body to us  they began to cavil now at the widows will in favor of mr wright and though they durst not openly declare themselves yet it is known they were endeavoring to inveigle the people into an opinion of young shutes title and dispersed papers to prove it nor did they use mr wright as though they ever expected he would come to the estate all we could do was to wish them hanged before they should bring it to pass for you must know we hate the young fellow heartily his father sir jacob if he was honestly begot used us horribly quartered soldiers upon us threatened our charter and played the devil for gods sake through the whole country till we were fain to send him packing and it is very well known the young rogue will never forgive us for it  the widow being to send one to old savages to adjust accounts on the accommodation who should these achitophels advise her to but jacob booty a notorious friend to the family of the shutes this put us in such a fright that we were ready to offer a leg or arm out of every family for indemnity for we supposed he could have no other business but to strike up a bargain at old savages but as it happened we had the good fortune to see him die in a ditch before he set out and save the h  n a labor whose occupation it is said he had merited a few years before by endeavoring to give the young gentleman possession of the north farm with design to burn and plunder it if he could not hold it by law  in short every day produced fresh instances of our misfortunes and of the villainies of those who had betrayed us old savage who before we had reduced to be as poor as a church mouse so that he lay even at our mercy began to bully us again reserving many of the conditions of the agreement unexecuted he demolished a turnpike upon the river which had been a great annoyance to our trade but fallaciously erected another a little nearer home and eluded the chief article of the accommodation he promised to dismiss young shute out of his family and with a mental reservation only sent him to board with one of his tenants at next door moreover he engaged to use his interest with young savage his grandson in behalf of some poor people that lay at his mercy on account of serving the widow who appeared under a great concern for them instead of which like an accomplished hypocrite he sent his mirmidons and bailiffs to haul them to execution  every thing was acted with the same candor and seemed to be pulling on our ruin whilst our agents at home out of the poorness of spirit durst not wag a tongue or a finger against him they lay so open and so exposed by the rogueries he was privy to ah poor country what could relieve thee but a miracle or what animate thy hopes but the interposition of providence that dear that eternal providence which had rescued thee in the like cases of imminent danger would you believe it sir that these desperados having no other way to shelter themselves were just entering into a conspiracy to undermine mr wrights interest and carry the trade to the popes head  it could not be expected that men associated in mischief should long agree among themselves which maxim it is very probable produced the old proverb when r  s and w  s fall out honest men come by their goods you may apply it as you please the use i shall make of it is only to tell you that the house began to be divided against itself and so could not stand long robin had now brought up a bird to pick out his eyes his pupil harry had got the start of him and jockeyed him out of the widows favor harry took up a resolution to spur at all aut caesar aut nullus but robin who had always a great veneration for his neck was willing to jog on soberly harry out of the vivacity of his temper told him he was a fellow of no spirit and that his cowardice quite balked the cause yes says robin very dryly but it may be a means of saving your neck if you take example by it and act with a little more deliberation and gravity this in the end came to an open rupture so that one day above the rest they fell to it pel mel before the widow robin among other things charged him with ingratitude and told him he took him up an idle loose young fellow straggling about the town when he had hardly nine pence in his pocket to go to a whore withal that he brought him acquainted at the widows and put him into business he might live handsomely upon if he had the grace to follow it but that it was plain he was as loose as ever and his management would be the ruin of his mistress if he went on as he begun harry justly fired at this language called him muddyheaded fellow and said if it had not been for him his mistress might have made a more advantageous composition robin in return to that upbraided him with his hairbraind negotiations and that he suffered himself to be made drunk and overreached at old savages where says he unless your interview with young shute for which i hope to see you hanged a few fine congees and two or three lewd intrigues the rest was owing to your companion matt the tavern boy who was fain to carry brains for his master harry could hardly contain himself but with a very cloudy brow told him he had neither brains nor any other merit to raise him above the character of a trickster we know now says he why none but cousin tom could be trusted at mr wrights but thou wast ever a trimming equivocal rascal and woot so continue  sim the scrivener put in a word on the same side whom robin took up very smartly as for your part says robin did i not raise you from a petifogger to be what you are took you from writing hackney up and down lent you money to pay your debts and helped you to live like a man and you to conspire against me too but by jove rapping his knuckles upon the table i will make you all as poor and beggarly as i found you thou were always a trickster replied sim i hated you before but now i despise you nab too opened her quail pipe at robin but what she said is not recorded  the widow heard all this with a mixture of grief and surprise but above all she wondered to hear them talk of a better composition when she had all along been told it was a very good one she plainly perceived now she had been tricked especially by robin who she declared had not told her one word of truth from the beginning so that harry for the present seemed to carry his point robin was ordered to deliver up his books which were soon after given to the chamberlain one of the honestest servants in the family which partly showed the widows good disposition for as he was known to be very well affected to mr wrights title it showed her own inclination thereto by pitching on a person so very acceptable this rejoiced people strangely and the more because there had passed a current rumor for some time that they had been tampering with her to transfer the estate to young shute after her decease contrary to law how true it is god knows but it seems they were disappointed and i can assure you she told some of her friends that she had often repented the dismissing her old servants who had served her faithfully and given content to her customers and if it pleased god to grant her life and health she would make a very great alteration in affairs  but in short what through the grief and fright she had conceived at their unmannerly behavior before her and the anguish of a former distemper it threw the pain into her head with such violence that it soon put an end to her life for which the whole town showed a general concern and lamented her as a pious good and charitable woman whom it may be truly said they brought with sorrow to the grave  immediately after she expired the trustees took possession of the premises in mr wrights name i cannot describe the infinite joy on this occasion and that wonderful satisfaction that appeared in peoples countenances all was acted with that calmness and unanimity that cheerfulness and alacrity as seemed plainly to prognosticate our future good no one was wanting to do his part nay even the parson of the parish though crazy with age and infirmities yet appeared abroad that day to countenance mr wrights title being one of the feofees in trust for him  poor harry aucumy indeed appeared under a very deep pressure of mind not so much for the loss of the widow as the sole power and grandeur he conceived himself fallen from and the inconveniences his past conduct might bring him into for he knew in his conscience he should find it a difficult matter to acquit himself honestly to mr wright this occasioned a visible alteration in his countenance and poor harry looked as queer and dejected as one of the vulgar he put himself in close mourning and exploded all lewdness for nine days which you know is the ultimate date of all wonders especially with harry john squeamish the headtapster a queer insignificant fellow of bobs preferring sam peticoat the warehouse keeper will wildfire harrys intimate dick the powdermonkey and nab his sister with some others seem to lament with the same humiliation and concern the great vicissitude of fortune  we expect our new landlord with the utmost impatience and then you shall have a farther account of what happens assuring you that this leaves us under the most promising aspect of having our affairs retrieved again from the languishing condition the last three years had thrown them into and perhaps you never saw a more visible spirit of joy than appears at present  yours etc ps as i divined poor harry is dismissed from his clerkship by order of mr wright and a padlock clapped on the counting house just now i learn from a friend that his accounts are very confused and occasion diverse speculations we are like to have a great sessions on it next time bob laughs in his sleeve    adieu
