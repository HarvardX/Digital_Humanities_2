a supplement to the state of the expedition from canada containing general burgoynes orders respecting the principal movements and operations of the army to the raising of the siege of ticonderoga  london printed for j robson newbondstreet t becket the corner of the adelphi strand and r baldwin paternoster row mdcclxxx  price one shilling and sixpence  advertisement the editor does not undertake to lay before the public the whole of general burgoynes orders during the campaign of       in so extensive a detail many would appear quite uninteresting at the present moment and even at the time they were given except perhaps to the departments immediately concerned as far as regarded their execution such are those respecting the daily duties the hospital the commiserate drivers etc those only have been selected that have for their object the general arrangements and movements of the army and which may tend to illustrate the operations of the campaign there are likewise some few by generals carleton and philips which are introduced here as relating in particular to general burgoynes expedition  the editors principal inducement for offering these orders to the public was drawn not only from the idea that the state of the expedition is incomplete without them but likewise from the observation of the avidity with which general wolfes orders were received by all ranks of people and particularly by the officers of the army it was conceived that if general wolfes orders were esteemed as models to commanding officers of corpse as well as instructive lessons in their profession to those of an inferior rank general burgoynes would more fully answer that description as they relate to military transactions far more important and to scenes infinitely more interesting to the public  beside that the author of them is known to add to the knowledge and experience of the general all the exterior graces and refinement of the scholar and the writer  it is but justice to his excellency the lieutenant general to acknowledge that these orders are published without his concurrence or authority  general orders by general carleton quebec may  0      the king having been pleased to order that a detachment from the army under my command be sent upon an expedition under lieutenant general burgoyne and that this detachment be composed of the grenadiers lightinfantry and   th regiment together with the  th  0th   st   th   d and   d regiments except a detachment of  0 men from each of the six lastmentioned regiments and all the german troops except a detachment of   0  these corpse will accordingly hold themselves in readiness to march at the shortest notice orders for which will be given by lieutenant general burgoyne to whom in the mean time they will make all reports as well as to the commander in chief the detachments of  0 with a captain two subalterns and noncommissioned officers in proportion from each of the six regiments as above will assemble at the present headquarters of their respective regiments and there remain until further orders  the artillery the department of the quartermastergeneral hospital and commiserate will likewise supply lieutenant general burgoyne with such returns as he may call for to enable him to lay before the commander in chief the portions of the several articles they are capable of furnishing  two hundred days bat baggage and forage money will be issued to the general and staff officers the hospital regiments lieutenant nutts detachment and the three companies of canadians the distribution lists of which are to be sent in as soon as possible to the paymastergenerals office  by general philips quebec may  st      major general philips has been directed by the commander in chief to inform the commanding officers of regiments of his excellencys desire that the army should take the field this campaign in the most perfect order  this will depend so entirely upon the several regiments being prepared by exercise and discipline that it is recommended to you to employ the utmost care and attention on such material points where your own character and honor are so intimately connected with the duty and good of his majestys service  his excellency the commander in chief has instructed major general philips to observe to you that the good discipline of a regiment in its general economy behavior and conduct in action will depend on the attention of that respectable rank of gentlemen the commanding officers of companies  it is from this rank of officers whose time of service and experience give them every possible weight and respect in a regiment that the subaltern officers are to take their example and their orders it is by the captains that the younger officers are to be instructed not only in the common military rules but in that propriety of conduct strict subordination and indefatigable attention so absolutely requisite in a regiment and by which alone the soldiers can be held in that obedience to and confidence in their officers which will make them bear the fatigues hardships and dangers of a campaign with patience with zeal and with spirit  courage has ever belonged to the british troops and there needs only to observe that a well disciplined body will always add to it a most essential principle in war  conduct  it is necessary that the officers should be perfectly acquainted with the soldiers of their company and that soldiers should know their officers and be accustomed to the sound of their voices the exercising by companies will be the surest means to effect those purposes  it is well understood that all regiments exercise by companies but it is usually done with a view of joining in battalion it is here meant that each company should be led to consider itself as a small distinct body and exercised in various evolutions independent of the battalion with every possible view for single companies being taught to depend upon themselves  as from the nature of the present war the abilities and military skill of officers may be required to be shown in detached parties and as it may frequently happen that single companies will have to act when an entire battalion cannot always maneuver by pursuing this idea which the commander in chief has expressed a strong desire of it will leave the officers and soldiers a dependence and attention on each other and give confidence to both  it will therefore be proper for every officer of a company to be perfectly well acquainted with and to exercise that company  for the commanding officer of a battalion to put himself at the head of one company and to maneuver that company while the other companies being drawn up at small intervals of distance follow the evolutions so given by the commanding officer  as the commander in chief has already ordered regiments in their exercise to make frequent changes of their positions and fronts and to march over difficult ground it will give the commanding officers of companies opportunities of showing a ready power of taking good posts and also though there may be certain separations owing to enclosures ravines ditches of water marshy ground etc of connecting the companies one with another and with the battalion  whenever a regiment when marching or maneuvering is obliged to break into parts from marshy ground ravines ditches small hills rocks or thick underwood it should be done if possible by companies which should divide as little as possible and never but in such parts as an officer or sergeant may have command of such separate division and this not at the will of the soldier but from the distinct orders of the officers so that the separated divisions may join as soon as the ground will permit into companies and from companies into battalion  the changing the order of companies at times in drawing up the battalion will make the soldiers ready in forming on general principles without regarding local stations of companies  his excellency has in view by this that the soldiers learn to be steady and attached to their own company and its officers  that the officers having a thorough knowledge of their men and being accustomed to such instances of separation as have been described suffer not the soldiers to act but from their words of command and orders  that every company may form a respectable body singly and though attached to its place in battalion yet always ready to act separate from it as the nature of the ground may require or the nature of the local service they may be sent on make necessary  major general philips has endeavored to explain the commander in chiefs pleasure by signifying how much his excellency depends on the support of captains commanding companies in this army and there can be no doubt of every respectable and attentive obedience to his excellencys injunctions and orders the commander in chief has not directed any thing relative to commanding officers and field officers of battalions as his excellency as well as every general officer of the army has reason to depend on their experience and to be assured of the strong exertion and active and spirited zeal of the fieldofficers for the particular character and credit of their own corpse and for the honor of his majestys service  by general burgoyne montreal may  0th      the regiments destined for the expedition under lieutenant general burgoyne are to leave in their respective stores their blanket coats leggings and all baggage that can be spared during the summer months  the officers are depended upon not to incumber the service with more baggage than is absolutely necessary for a campaign where the movements may be expected to be sudden and alert the portions of batteaux to each regiment will be regulated on those principles three women per company will be allowed to follow the army  the exercise of the troops under the lieutenant generals orders is to be confined to firing with

and encamp at or near st therese detaching two companies to chamblee this regiment will likewise be aiding and assisting in forwarding every thing necessary for general burgoynes army  the royal highland emigrants will detach a company to sorel for the like purpose and brigadiergeneral maclean will make a tour to the places on that river and order such part of his regiment to take post there

at river bouquet june  0th      officers of all ranks commanding outposts and detachments are constantly to fortify in the best manner the circumstances of the place and the implements at hand will permit felling trees with their points outward barricading churches and houses breastworks of earth and timber are generally to be effected in a short time and the science of engineering is not necessary to find and apply such resources  the practice of fortifying is useful in all services but especially in this where the enemy though infinitely inferior to the kings troops in open space and hardy combat is well fitted by disposition and practice for the stratagems and enterprises of little war and neither the distance of camps nor the interference of forests and rivers are to be looked upon as security against their attempts upon the same principle it must be a constant rule in or near woods to place advanced sentries where they have a tree or some other defense to prevent them from being taken off by single marksmen together with these precautions officers will ever bear in mind how much the public honor and their own are concerned in maintaining a post and that to justify a retreat in this war the number of the enemy must be much superior to that which would make their justification when acting against a brave and disciplined force  the officers will take all opportunities and especially at the beginning of the campaign to inculcate into the minds of the men a reliance upon the bayonet men of half their bodily strength and even cowards may be their match at firing but the onset of bayonets in the hands of the valiant is irresistible  the enemy convinced of this truth place their dependence in entrenchments and riflepieces  it will be our glory and preservation to storm where possible the attention of every officer is to be employed on his men to make use of his fusil unless in very extraordinary cases of immediate personal defense would betray an ignorance of his importance and of his duty  no occasion can make it necessary to keep the arms loaded in the bell tents nor are the battalions of the line ever to be loaded on the march till very near the time they may happen to engage  no parties are to go from camp with or without arms unless with a proportionable number of officers  not only the discipline and honor but even the safety of the troops require the strictest prohibition from straggling and plundering and the savages as well as the provost will have orders to punish all offenders in these respects instantly and with the utmost rigor  the camp will always be extended as widely as the ground will admit for the sake of cleanliness and health  but as it must often happen that the extent will be insufficient for the line to form in front of the camp according to the present established rules of open files and two deep  the quartermastergeneral will therefore mark out at every new camp the proportion of ground each battalion is to clear over and above its own front in order to make the work equal to clear this ground must be the immediate business after arriving in camp and in this country it may be often necessary to have an alarmpost cleared in the rear as well as in front  by clearing is meant the removal of such obstructions as might prevent the ready forming of troops to receive or advance upon the enemy  quarter guards are always to face outward and at the distance of one hundred yards from the bells of arms with a fleche of earth or timber thrown up before them when the encampment of the line is with the front to the water and too near to admit of this regulation the quarter guard is to be posted in the rear or those of the flank regiments occasionally upon the flanks though the ground will seldom admit a strict regularity in pitching the officers tents they are never to be placed so as to interfere with the line of defense  when the lieutenant general visits an outpost the men are not to stand to their arms or pay him any compliment the articles of war which regard the men to be read at the head of every regiment tomorrow at evening parade and afterward these regulations  the daily duties are to be as follows  one brigadiergeneral for the day who will visit the outposts and have a general inspection of the camp all reports to be made through him except when any alarm or other exigence requires instant notice to the commander in chief  a major of brigade for the day who is to parade all guards detachments etc the picquet when the last brigade arrives will consist of one fieldofficer for each wing one captain each brigade one subaltern one sergeant one corporal and twenty men each regiment  a drummer to be furnished by the regiment that gives the captain the whole picquet to assemble half an hour before gunfiring at the center of the line and to be exercised in marching and charging bayonets under the inspection of the brigadier of the day in order that the british and german troops may acquire an uniformity of pace and motions when acting together in the line half the picquet is always to be posted during the night at some distance from the camp and at such places as may be exposed to the secret approaches of the enemy it will be the care of the brigadier of the day to post them  camp at crownpoint june         should it be necessary for the line to embark suddenly two guns will be fired on the right wing upon the signal being given the mens tents to be struck immediately and stowed in the batteaux together with their knapsacks blankets provision and ammunition  as no other stores will be allowed to be carried seventeen batteaux will suffice for each battalion of british and twentytwo for each german battalion should it be necessary for the line to march suddenly without embarking four guns will be fired from the right  at which signal the line is to form with all possible expedition in front of the bells of arms and the tents to be left standing this order to remain in force during the campaign  headquarters at skeensboroughhouse july  0      on the sixth the enemy was dislodged from ticonderoga by the mere countenances and activity of the army and driven on the same day beyond skeensborough on the right and hubberton on the left with the loss of all their artillery and five of their armed vessels taken or blown up by the spirited conduct of captain carter of the artillery with part of his brigade of gunboats a great quantity of ammunition provision and stores of all sorts and all their baggage  on the  th brigadier fraser with little more than half the advanced corpse and without artillery which with the utmost endeavors it was found impossible to bring up came up with  000 of the enemy strongly posted attacked and defeated them with the loss on the enemys side of their principal officers  00 men killed on the spot a much greater number wounded and  00 taken prisoners  on the  th lieutenant colonel hill at the head of the ninth regiment was attacked near fort anne by more than six times his number and repulsed the enemy with great loss after a continued fire of three hours in consequence of this action fort anne was burnt and abandoned and a part of this army is in possession of the country on the other side  these rapid successes after exciting a proper sense of what we owe to god intitles the troops in general to the warmest praise  and particular distinction is due to brigadiergeneral fraser who by his conduct and bravery supported by the officers and soldiers under his command effected an exploit of material service to the king and of signal honor to the profession of arms this corpse have the further merit of having supported fatigue and bad weather without bread and without murmur  divine service will be performed on sunday morning at the head of the line and at the head of the advanced corpse and on the same day at sunset a feudejoye will be fired with cannon and smallarms from ticonderoga crownpoint the camp at skeensborough and the post of breymens corpse  skeensboroughhouse july         it is observed that the injunctions before the army took the field relative to the baggage of officers has not been complied with and that the regiments in general are incumbered with much more baggage than they can possibly be supplied with means of conveying when they quit the lakes and rivers warning is therefore given to the officers to convey by the batteaux which will soon return to ticonderoga the baggage that is not indispensably necessary to them or upon the first sudden movement it must inevitably be left on the ground such gentlemen as served in america last war may remember that officers took up with a soldiers tent and confined their baggage to a knapsack for months together  when opportunity shall offer to carry forward the baggage which will be left at ticonderoga so as not to interfere with the transport of magazines the lieutenant general will be happy to contribute to the convenience and comfort of his officers  skeensboroughhouse july         the disturbance of the   th instant between the british troops and the germans was occasioned by liquor and one of the first principles of military order was so far forgotten by some british soldiers that a guard was insulted any conduct for the future either of germans or british that shall tend to obstruct the harmony which has hitherto so happily reigned between the two nations and which must continue among brave troops serving in the same cause unless violated by intoxication or misapprehension will be punished as a crime the most fatal to the success and honor of the campaign  camp at fort edward aug        it appearing that there is still some misapprehension in some corpse of the army respecting the carriage of officers baggage when the service shall make it necessary to quit the rivers  it is henceforward to be understood that no provision has been made by the kings orders nor by those of his excellency sir guy carleton for this purpose nor is there any example of such being made when the allowance of bat and forage money has been in the proportion of that granted the last and present year to the army in canada such gentlemen therefore as have not already understood this general system of the service will provide themselves by purchase as opportunity offers always remembering that the prohibition of purchasing from savages is still in force  duer camp august         it was endeavored among other objects by the expedition which marched to the left to provide such a supply of cattle as would have enabled the army to proceed without waiting the arrival of the magazines that attempt having failed of success through the chances of war the troops must necessarily halt some days for bringing forward the transport of provisions and the several corpse will employ that time to collect the sick convalescents and such other parties as are merely employed in regimental duties  duer camp august         it having been observed a common practice for officers to order to be taken from the provision train in the service of the king for this army the carts and horses for the carrying of baggage and other purposes to avoid for the future this danger and inconvenience to the service it is in the most positive manner ordered that no cart or horse is to be used but for the public transport of the army nor is any officer accidentally coming to any particular post to interfere with the provision train in any other manner than to give it every aid and assistance in his power which he is on all occasions to do  camp near batten kill aug         the lieutenant general having received a report from lieutenant colonel breymen relative to the action of saintcoick mills and likewise having received every collateral information possible thinks it but justice to declare publicly that he has no reason to be dissatisfied with the personal spirit of the troops that on the contrary the officers commanding corpse acted with intrepidity on that occasion the failure of the enterprise seems to be owing in the first instance to the credulity of those who managed the department of intelligence who suffered great numbers of the rebels to pass and repass and perhaps to count the number of the detachment and upon illgrounded confidence induced lieutenant colonel baume to advance too far the next cause was the slow movement of lieutenant colonel breymen who from bad weather bad roads and tired horses together with other impediments stated by lieutenant colonel brehmen could not reach    miles from eight in the morning of the   th to four in the afternoon of the   th the succor therefore arrived too late the failure of ammunition in the management of which there seems to have been some improvidence was another misfortune the rest seem common occurrences of war upon the whole the enemy has felt very little success and there is no circumstance to affect the army with further regret or melancholy than that which arises from the loss of some gallant men  but let the affair of the mill of saintcoick remain henceforward as a lesson against the imposition of a treacherous enemy many of whom in the very hour of swearing allegiance to the king foughtagainst his troops and against expending ammunition too fast which obliged conquering troops to retreat the reflection on this affair will moreover excite alertness and exertion in every corpse marching to the support of another by showing in whatever degree these qualities may be possessed by the commanding officers and they are not to be doubted in the present instance yet unless they are general common accidents may become fatal in the course of two hours may decide the turn of an expedition and may even decide in some cases the fate of a campaign  batten kill aug         great irregularities having been committed by conductors and other followers of the army camp courtsmartial will occasionally be assembled in the nature of a general court martial consisting of one captain and four subalterns from the line who will try such offenders according to the clause in the mutiny act which subjects all followers of the army to military law  as long as a brigadier shall be on duty at ticonderoga the brigadier with the army shall command both brigades  batten kill aug  0      strict economy in the receipt and delivery of provisions at all times an essential duty now becomes an object of the greatest consequence the fate of the campaign may depend upon it and as the preservation of the live cattle demands the most particular attention they are only to be slaughtered for the sick and in such cases as are absolutely necessary  the commanding officers are therefore to send in an account upon honor of the fresh provisions necessary for their sick to the commissary the day before the general issue of provisions to the army and be responsible that the proper deduction of rations is made for the fresh provision received  whenever the stock of cattle shall be sufficient to admit of it every attention shall be paid to the comfort and convenience of officers and notice will be given when they can be supplied with rations of fresh provisions instead of salt  the lieutenant general meaning that every regiment should be on the same regulation directs that the servants and batmen be allowed as follows servants batmen field officer       captain       subalterns of a company        when the mens tents are carried on bathorses a batman to be allowed to each company  the servants to be considered as effective in the ranks and to attend every evening parade the other parades at rollcallings they are exempted from unless the regiments are under arms the batmen to be always armed and to form the baggageguard the commanding officers of regiments will take care that this order be complied with strictly  whenever cattle are killed it must be always at night  the commissaries are made answerable for this all cattle brought into camp to be sent to the board of regulation and by that board to be sent to the commissarygeneral the troops must be sensible that buying cattle privately and by that means preventing a general supply must prove very injurious to the service  batten kill september        the

to quit the camp and no soldier or follower of the army is to pass the fishkill on pain of the severest punishment  the present post of the six companies of the   th regiment being dismissed to cover the depot of provisions these companies are not to take any duties of the line but will augment their picquet to  0 men which during the night will occupy a post on the island and another on the point of land on the south side of the fishkill where it falls into the river  the  0th regiment will advance four companies to cover headquarters  they will bring their tents and receive orders from sir francis clarke  the picquets and quarterguards of the line to be posted on the right flank of the incampment so as to form a line with the british light infantry  if it should be necessary to form the line of battle in that front the regiments will march to it by two columns the  th regiment followed by the   st making the column on the right and the   d regiment followed by the  0th making the column on the left in order to fill up the place between the corpse of general fraser and colonel brehemn  brigadier hamilton will order a communication and mark it to the commanding officers in such a manner that it may be made in the night time with alertness and without confusion  when major general philips shall have directed the roads proper for the park of artillery in this movement they are to be reconnoitred by their respective officers that their march may not clash with the column  if this movement is made the   th regiment keeps its ground and is to defend it to the last against any attack from the other side of the water and the four companies that cover the headquarters are to take post in the redoubt above the bridge that leads to headquarters  in case of any movement from this side of hudsons river major general reidesel will form the left wing of the army at the head of their incampment but not march off their ground the quartermasters and campcolourmen of the left wing are to mark out their ground tomorrow morning but that wing is not to pass the river till the last of the depot has crossed the bridge for the expediting which purpose all the departments concerned are to use their utmost diligence  camp at saratoga september         during the next march of the army the corpse are to move in such a state as to be fit for instant action it is therefore unavoidably necessary to circumspect more than is at present done brigade conveyances in regard to attendance upon baggage cattle and other inferior purposes  the brigadiers will collect tomorrow from the commandingofficers of corpse under their command a report of the number of rank and file each corpse can march and how the rest are disposed of  it is to be a standing order for the rest of the campaign that all picquets and guards are to be under arms an hour before daylight every morning and so continue till it is quite light all outposts and outlying picquets to send patroles at the same time  camp near swordshouse september         to the great reproach of discipline of the common sense of soldiers who have been made prisoners the service has sustained a loss within these few days that might have cost some hundreds of the enemy to have brought on in action the lieutenant general will no longer bear to lose men for the pitiful consideration of potatoes or forage the soldier is the property of the king and since friendly admonitions repeated injunctions and corporal punishment will have no effect the army is now to be informed and it is not doubted the commandingofficers will do it solemnly that the first soldier caught beyond the advanced sentries of the army will be instantly hanged  in case of an action the lieutenant general will be found near the british line or he will leave word there where he may be followed and a subalternofficer is to be sent from each of the following corpse viz one from the british line one from brigadiergeneral frasers corpse and one

enemy it is the generals orders that the several corpse incamp on their present ground immediately  the lieutenant general having had an opportunity of observing the conduct of the troops on all parts in the action of the   th instant thinks it incumbent on him to give his public testimony of the exemplary spirit of the officers in general and in many instances of the private men in both these distinctions the artillery is to be included and the brigade under captain jones deserves a peculiar place his warmest thanks to major general philips cannot be omitted on any occasion when added to the service of the department under his immediate inspection he finds himself under great obligation for a most able and zealous second in command  the zeal and spirit of major general reidesel also deserves the lieutenantgenerals acknowledgement the regular fire given by the troops he brought up and the good countenance of the germans were fully noticed  brigadiergeneral fraser took his position at the beginning of the day with great judgment and sustained the action with his usual presence of mind and vigor  brigadiergeneral hamilton acquitted himself honorably by his activity and conduct during an action of several hours  amidst these several actions of applause the impetuosity and uncertain aim of the british troops in giving their fire and the mistake they are still under of preferring it to the bayonet is much to be lamented the lieutenant general is persuaded this error will be corrected in the next engagement upon the conviction of their own reason and reflection as well as upon that general precept of discipline never to fire but by order of an officer  one hundred and twenty brave men of courage and fidelity from the provincial corpse of jessup peters mcalpin and mckay are to be incorporated for this campaign only into the six british regiments in the proportion of twenty to a regiment they will have a certificate from under the hand of the lieutenant general to entitle them to a discharge on the   th day of december next they will besides receive a gratuity on being incorporated and another at the expiration of their service and these will be the

a fault as suffering a surprise but the occasion cannot be overlooked of repeating to officers in general the necessity of vigilance and unremitting alertness on their posts and of warning them that
