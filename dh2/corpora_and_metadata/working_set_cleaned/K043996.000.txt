remarks concerning the encroachments on the river thames near durhamyard  addressed to the right honorable the lord mayor the worshipful the aldermen and the common council of the city of london  in two parts  london printed by g bigg in the year mdcclxxi  to the right honorable the lord mayor the worshipful the aldermen and the common council of the city of london my lord and gentlemen before the legislature had entirely assented to the late bill in favor of the encroachments near durhamyard the two following little tracts were drawn up with a view to prevent the confirmation of that injustice but as they were not finished time enough to be communicated with any hope of success to those persons for whose perusal they were at first intended i think it my duty in the next place to address them to you as they particularly relate to the rights and property of the city of london  when property is taken away from the ancient and legal proprietors without their consent and vested in other persons even private individuals as their own property for their own private advantage by parliamentary authority such a precedent will render the property of all men as precarious as their party interest and will enlarge the dangerous system of public corruption by increasing the means of its baneful influence  but this is not merely a political evil it is also immoral and irreligious in every point of view to remove the ancient land mark or boundary is an accursed crime according to the laws of god compare deuteronomy xix    xxvii    job xxiv   proverbs xxii    so that every kind of wilful encroachment upon the property of others is in some degree tainted with this heinous guilt  times are bad enough when such invasions on public or private property remain unpunished but the moral state of any nation is even deplorable and their measure of iniquity may be said to be almost filled up when such notorious acts of injustice meet with public encouragement instead of reprehension and when trespassers are rewarded and gratified to the exclusion of the injured proprietor with a parliamentary right even in the very object which tempted them to break the laws and wrong their neighbors  many well meaning people do not seem to be aware of the bad tendency of this example and there is therefore the more necessity that it should be pointed out and exposed  the injustice appeared to me so notorious after i had carefully considered the case that i should have been inclined as a citizen of the world to represent the monstrous immorality of rewarding instead of punishing trespassers lest the evil example should become epidemical and contagious in the world which is already too corrupt but as a citizen of london it is even my duty to do so in the present case for when i took the oath of allegiance to the king i was sworn at the same time to maintain the franchises and customs of the city of london to the utmost of my power see the oath of every freeman you shall swear that ye shall be good and true to our sovereign lord king george obeysant and obedient ye shall be to the mayor and ministers of this city the franchises and customs thereof ye shall maintain and this city keep harmless in that that in you is etc  and therefore as i hope i shall ever be faithful to the city of london as well as true to our most gracious sovereign i esteem it my indispensible duty to both for the sake of public justice to point out the illegality as it appears to me and dangerous tendency of publicly rewarding the trespassers on the rights of this great city with an exclusive title to the very object of their temptation to trespass  the manner of making these encroachments viz by throwing rubbish into the water without any fence to retain it has been as hurtful to the river as the encroachments themselves without affording the least probability of any one good effect saving or convenience whatsoever to recommend it a method unfavourable to every purpose except the clandestine designs of trespassers that the intended projection of their encroachments may not surprise and alarm the public before the mischief is carried into execution as for instance  if the space which has lately been thus gradually stolen from the river near durham yard had been previously marked off with piles for the boundaries of a wharf or with a bank of large chalkstones or other hard materials not liable to be washed away as all embankments on navigable rivers ought to be made the trespass would have appeared much more enormous at first than by this method which rendered the progress of the growing encroachments less notorious and alarming  since these late trespasses began the bed of the river as i have been informed by several watermen and others who have been well acquainted with the river for many years is considerably increased in height which is certainly occasioned in great measure by the manner of embanking above described  but i am sorry my lord and gentlemen to observe that the city is as much to blame on this account as the encroachers for my fellow citizens or some of them have suffered themselves to be persuaded that this is the most eligible way of embanking and they have therefore adopted or at least do allow the practice of this pernicious and slovenly method in those parts where the embankment is authorized so that the city seems to betray her own cause as if she really intended by setting this bad example to justify the like notorious abuse near durhamyard and thereby render the progress and iniquity of that growing encroachment less conspicuous and remarkable it behooves the city to enquire how such an inconsistency began for this rude slovenly and unmechanical measure could not have been adopted for the sake of saving either time or expense in the work because it certainly requires a much greater quantity of rubbish than would have been really necessary to fill up the space intended to be embanked and this to the manifest detriment of the river for the lighter particles of the rubbish are constantly washed away from the banks every tide both up and down the stream and must inevitably lodge at the bottom of the river because the current runs alternately both ways and for the same reason the boasted scheme of contracting the avenue of the river will not it is manifest prevent the gradual filling up of the bed because the rubbish and filth that is washed away from the banks at one time of tide is liable to be brought back again at another and so to be shifted backwards and forwards till the whole is gradually incorporated in a thick heavy loam at the bottom of the river which at length becomes too firm to be affected or removed by the current and by this means the bed will probably be so raised in process of time as to render the river totally unfit for navigation  it is therefore absolutely necessary my lord and gentlemen to put a stop as soon as possible to this scandalous practice viz of throwing rubbish into the river without a fence to retain it whether the embankments are allowed to proceed or not but it is certainly more for the interest of the city to cut new docks and recesses from the river and to clear and deepen the old ones than to embank  there are likewise some other abuses to which the alarming increase of the rivers bed is likewise in some degree to be attributed for besides many other lesser encroachments that are continually making on both sides the river by enlarging the banks with rubbish driving piles etc i am informed that rubbish from buildings refuse from the dyehouses etc have sometimes been thrown out of lighters into the river in the night in order to save the trouble and expense of carrying the load farther away  i have been told this by several persons who have accidentally seen the like trespasses  it is therefore become necessary for the future preservation of this noble river that the city should offer a proper reward to all watermen and others that shall give the first information at guildhall or the mansion house of any such encroachments or misdemeanors in future the reward should be paid when the offender is convicted and might perhaps be defrayed out of the fine for the offense and the waterbailiffs should likewise be rewarded in the same manner whenever they shall have been vigilant enough to give the first notice of any misdemeanor a proper inquest of citizens should be appointed out of each ward by rotation or else be impanneled by the sheriffs as a jury from time to time as there should be occasion to examine the complaints as soon as any informations are received and the assent or leave of such an inquest to any encroachment driving of piles etc should not be allowed to authorize the same or put a stop to further enquiry lest they should be in any degree influenced by private solicitation or be otherwise tampered with which has sometimes been the case on public inquiries when nuisances have been presented but the final determination should rest as at present with the court of common council and no waterbailiff or other city officer whatever should have power to excuse or tolerate the driving any piles or the least encroachment for when such a power is vested in any officer whose charge is of this nature it is apt to destroy the intended utility of his office because the more offenses and encroachments are committed the more fees and christmas compliments he will probably receive and annually demand as the price of toleration and forbearance the office of water bailiff though it affords an ample proof of the ancient jurisdiction and right of the city of london to the river thames yet has been hitherto in general i fear rather a means of authorizing encroachments than of preventing them  i do not mean to blame the conduct of your water bailiff or of any other officer in particular for custom has so reconciled the giving of pecuniary acknowledgments to the water bailiff for tolerating encroachments as i have been informed that the same are looked upon as the lawful and just dues of his office and he does not clandestinely demand them but openly and as it were by the authority of the city which receives of every such officer at his appointment a very large sum of money for the purchase of his office in consideration of these emoluments  i say  in consideration of these emoluments because the same must necessarily be supposed to be known and understood by the sellers as well as the buyers at the time of the purchase if the proper income and value of the office be compared with the enormous price that has of late been given for it the profits or salary ought therefore to be made adequate in some other way otherwise the city and not the waterbailiff must be blamed  i ought not however to blame the city without endeavoring at the same time to obviate the objection which some persons have lately urged against her on the same account viz that by neglecting to prevent abuses and encroachments she has forfeited her right of conservancy but as i have already shown in the two little tracts sent herewith that the city has a natural as well as legal right to her jurisdiction on the river i need only add further that the like plea of forfeiture if it were once admitted would be equally effectual to deprive any lord or gentleman of his family estate and patrimony for there are but few men i fear who make so good a use of their possessions as they might and ought though there are very many that would pretend to improve and dispose of the same more advantageously for the public good if such a plea was sufficient to justify an attempt to dispossess the right owner but to return  i do not mean to blame the city for selling the office of water bailiff but rather for not publishing before it is offered to sale proper conditions instructions and injunctions to point out the duties of the office and for not giving notice that the same is liable to the penalty of forfeiture for maladministration in order that the purchaser may thereby be enabled to regulate his conduct agreeable to the real duty of his office and may know that he forfeits his place if he wilfully tolerates the least encroachment were this method observed the selling of places i mean places merely of trust that dont require great learning and science would be by far the most eligible way of disposal because recommendations and great interest are far from being certain proofs of the most deserving candidate whereas the purchase money would be a certain and real gain as well as an excellent security for good behavior but without such instructions and conditions the private emolument of the officer is too liable to interfere with the public utility of the office whereas by the method which i have already submitted to your consideration viz of offering rewards for the first discovery of offenses every waterman would find it his interest to take upon himself the office of a diligent and inexorable waterbailiff because the proposed reward arises from the public proof instead of the concealment and toleration of offenses and there would be too many of these voluntary officers to be bribed to secrecy  i am with great respect my lord and gentlemen your most obedient and most humble servant granville sharp old jewry  0 aug      remarks concerning the encroachments on the river thames near durhamyard part i part i some remarks on the case of the city of london with respect to the encroachments on the river thames near durhamyard and the bill now depending in parliament to establish the said trespasses it cannot be denied notwithstanding all the delusive sophistry that has been used upon this occasion that the city of london has ever enjoyed and exercised on the river thames a right of conservancy as well of the width or avenue by occasionally inspecting and regulating the boundaries as of the fishery with power and authority to remove all nuisances so that this franchise or liberty is absolutely vested in the city by prescription and ancient usage besides many positive grants and confirmations  and what freeholder will be able to produce a more authentic title to his estate and property for a long process of time and a long use possession or custom which exceeds the memory of man is sufficient to constitute a right or just title longum tempus et longus usus qui excedit memoriam hominum sufficit pro jure principia legis et aequitatis p    see also co lit     there is besides an express article in magna charta to secure to the city of london all her ancient liberties and customs  civitas londini habeat omnes libertates suas antiquas et consuetudines suas cap   amongst which undoubtedly this right and custom of conservancy is to be reckoned as one of the most material franchises because the very existence of this great trading city depends upon it so that the citys title to the conservancy is founded on a natural as well as legal right  the pretended consent of the collegiate church of westminster cannot palliate the trespass or lessen the injury to the city of london the grant of king james on which the claim of that church is said to be founded could not convey a power to embank and fill up the river nor a right to confirm such a trespass when committed because the king himself had no such power and consequently had no right to grant it so that the jurisdiction said to extend infra finem aquoe to the middle of the stream must be construed in some other sense or it will otherwise render the whole grant null and void because the river thames is a public avenue or passage to the city so that in this respect it is to be considered as the kings highway and it is esteemed the kings highway no otherwise than in trust for the public so that the king has no power to dispense with an encroachment on the highway for though he may pardon nusances that are transient and not continuing  yet a nuisance in the highway which still continues and is not ended until removed cannot be pardoned judge vaughans reports     because the same is to be esteemed evil and iniquitous in its very nature a malum in se bad in itself which is further proved by the same learned author in p     i may conclude says he those things to be mala in se which can never be made lawful he then cites the yearbook of    henry   viz but malum in se the king nor any other can dispense and instanceth si come si le roy voyloit pardon de occider un homme ou de fair nuisance in le haut chemin ceo est void to wit if the king should be willing to pardon the killing of a man or rather as the next sentence explains it will give power to kill a man or to make a nuisance in the highroad the same is void  and upon the same reason says he a license to imprison a man to take his land his horse or any thing that is his from him is void for in life liberty and estate every man who has not forfeited them has a property and right which the law allows him to defend and if it is violated it gives an action to redress the wrong and to punish the wrongdoer  therefore a dispensation that is to make lawful the taking from a man any thing which he may lawfully defend from being taken or lawfully punish if it be must be void for it is a contradiction to make it lawful to take what may be lawfully hindered from being taken or lawfully punished if it be and that were to make two men have several plenary rights in the same thing at the same time which no law can effect therefore to do a thing which no law can make lawful must be  malum in se  this argument clearly proves the impropriety of pretending a right or power in the crown or in the church of westminster to give their consent for the establishment of the trespass in the river at durhamyard  the right of conservancy has been invested in the city of london from the most ancient times so that the king cannot resume that power if he would for it is a maxim in law that a quiet and uninterrupted possession for  0 years creates a just title possessio pacifica pour anns  0 facit jus see judge jenkins to the same effect cent    and the kings order command or letters patent have no legal weight or effect against such a right for rescriptum principis contra jus non valet on the other hand the right of the church of westminster to the river even supposing that it had been lawful for king james the first to grant such a right is nevertheless forfeited for want of being claimed and put in use since that time whereas the right of the citizens of london is sufficiently established according to the maxims before cited by the exercise and enjoyment of a continual and undisputed jurisdiction upon the river as being their undoubted right and property surely for more than  0 years last past  and a right or property thus acquired is as valid even against the pretensions of the crown as against those of the church of westminster or even as against those of a private man  for the nullum tempus doctrine cannot justify the kings claim to the soil of the thames because the right of the crown in manors lands tenements etc is exactly upon the same footing with respect to time as private freeholds for bracton informs us that in all such things  currit tempus contra regem sicut contra quam libet privatam personam bracton de legibus et consuetudinibus angliae  d b c   p    i have thoroughly examined the doctrine of nullum tempus occurrit regi in a little tract expressly upon that subject and therefore need not enlarge upon it here  now as the city of london has acquired so firm a title to her jurisdiction by a quiet possession for  0 years according to the maxim before quoted how unjust is it at this time to call her right in question when it is notorious that the same may as easily be traced back more than  0 see the charter of richard  st c  d cited in the royal charter of confirmation by charles the  d to the city of london p   we have clearly quit claimed all that which the keepers of the tower of london were wont yearly to receive of the said wares  speaking of wares in the thames to the detriment of the city and this charter is expressly said to have been given for the souls health of king henry our father and all our ancestors souls probably meaning his ancestors of the norman line who had unjustly usurped those rights the jurisdiction of the city of london upon the river was soon after acknowledged also by his brother king john see his charter cited in the posthumous works of sir h spelman p    et civitas londinensis habeat omnes antiquas libertates et liberas consuetudines suas tam per terras quam per aquas n b even at that time they were esteemed antiquas libertates etc   times  0 years for ex diuturnitate temporis omnia praesumuntur solenniter esse acta  we are taught also by the unquestionable whosoever denies the force and weight

cogitur rem suam vendere etiam justo pretio   inst      and again that which is my own cannot be taken from me without my consent quod meum est a me sine me auferri non potest jenk cent      there is indeed an exception to these general maxims and that is when the public benefit requires such an alienation as for the making of public roads canals in all the cases here mentioned it is necessary that the alienated private property should be vested in the public or in the crown for the public and not as the private property of any individuals whatsoever notwithstanding that the public may seem to be benefited by their private undertakings precedents of this kind have indeed been established by some late acts for cutting canals but i flatter myself that the legislature was not then aware of the impropriety of such examples the proposal of the city of london for cutting a canal from isleworth upwards was a proper pattern for all other undertakings of that nature because the property was to be vested in the public and it was intended finally to be made a free navigation so that of course it would have been considered in law as the kings highway etc or building fortifications for the public safety in all such cases private advantage must give way to the public good privatum commodum publico cedit and privatum incommodum publico bono pensatur jenk cent     and    but when the public property vested in a body corporate in trust for the public advantage is clandestinely taken away by encroachment and an attempt is made to establish the trespass and vest that public property in private hands for private advantage without the consent of the ancient and legal trustees it is to reverse the very fundamental principles of natural equity and to turn the once firm pyramid of the law upon its point instead of its basis so as to threaten ruin and destruction to all things within the reach of its fall  the pretense that the public will be benefited in proportion to the advantage arising to the trespassers is frivolous and ought not by any means to be admitted it savours of partiality to view a public benefit through the medium of a private advantage because the public utility usually alleged in such cases proves   times in  0 a mere pretense and nothing illegal ought to be admitted even though the pretense for it is lawful pretextu liciti non debet admitti illicitum  0 co     there are also some other things alleged as reasons for showing favor to this trespass viz the taste and skill of the architects and the public ornament of their edifices etc but all such pretenses are equally frivolous with the first when they interfere with public right and franchise for the law does not favor the elegant and sumptuous lex non favet delicatorum votis   co     yet the city paid a proper attention it is manifest to the merit of the architects and the appearance of their buildings by discovering an inclination which i have elsewhere mentioned more at large to allow them sufficient room to make a convenient wharf that the purposes of their noble vaults might not be injured but as more than this would be superfluous the citizens could not have been justified had they not rejected the unconscionable request of the trespassers especially as it was thought that the addition of a large timberyard for the private use and advantage of the builders would not according to the taste of the citizens at least contribute much to public ornament and elegance the other pretense of public utility was as little apparent to the citizens in general as this last for it is still doubtful and remains to be proved as i have shown in another paper whereas there is no doubt of the illegality of the trespass for the same was notorious as well with respect to the encroachment itself as the manner of making it by throwing so many thousand cartloads of rubbish into the river without a fence to retain it which must certainly prejudice the river by lessening the depth  this

saepe committi quae saepe vindicantur   inst epilogue  if all these points are carefully considered the bill must manifestly appear inconsistent with the spirit and principles of the common law nay it is so notoriously unjust that it affords us some comfort even by the excess of its illegality  for i have already shown it to be a malum per se and contrary to natural right and therefore i trust that it will be null and void of itself even if it should gain the assent of all the three branches of the legislature for no law can establish what nature or natural right prohibits quae rerum natura prohibentur nulla lege confirmata sunt finch    and whatsoever is done contrary to law may be esteemed as undone a mere nullity quod contra legem fit pro infecto habetur   co     but above all let it be remembered that the old liberties and customs of the city of london amongst which the conservancy of the river thames medway and lee is perhaps the most essential to her welfare and very existence are secured to her by an express article of magna charta chap   which i have already remarked in the beginning of this little tract and therefore it behooves the learned in the law to demonstrate that this bill is not in any point derogatory to the said  th chapter of magna charta but if this cannot be done the joint authority of king lords and commons is not sufficient to pass it into a law  i mean a valid and constitutional law such as can be maintained without corruption and arbitrary power because it is assented and accorded by an act of the   d year of king edward iii chap   which is still in force and must ever remain so that the great charter and charter of the forest be holden and kept in all points and if any statute be made to the contrary that shall be holden for none  granville sharp old jewry  th may      remarks concerning the encroachments on the river thames near durhamyard part ii part ii some further remarks concerning the injury done to the city of london by the encroachments on the river thames near durhamyard the extraordinary favor shown in parliament to the trespasses lately committed by several persons in the enormous encroachment on the river thames near durhamyard is liable to affect the security of property in general because an encouragement to commit trespasses and a precedent to establish and confirm the same when committed do certainly tend to the total subversion of justice for in every point of view the same are repugnant to the fundamental principles of law and equity  actions were commenced in the court of kings bench against the encroachments before the trespassers brought their bill into parliament so that the concurrence of parliament with the authors of the injury is a gross insult upon the laws by stopping the regular course of justice in a matter of right which came properly before the kings courts for as it is esteemed unjust to punish a man by the force of an ex post facto law it certainly is equally unjust by an ex post facto law to confirm and establish a manifest trespass which was previously referred to a proper court for redress and the application to parliament is of itself a sufficient proof that the right and claim of the city of london are just and such as must necessarily have found a remedy in law according to the usual proceedings of the kings courts otherwise the ex post facto law had been needless  it ought to be remembered also that the city of london for the sake of peace and to avoid a contest in parliament was inclined to allow some of the trespassers who are eminent builders as much ground in the front of their buildings as would be sufficient to make a wharf wide enough for carts to come down and to turn and load etc as at other quays in the city so that the use and intention of the noble underground passages might not be lost or in the least injured and a private intimation of this lenity and favor to which the city seemed disposed was given to a friend of the builders that they might be advised to petition the city for room to make such a wharf and they were told that the same would probably be granted in consideration of their great expenses and the grandeur of their buildings  but instead of such a petition the builders presented a memorial they did not deign to call it a petition desiring more than   or   times as much room as was necessary for the said purpose because it seems a wharf alone would not content them but as builders they must be indulged also with room enough out of the width of the river to make likewise for a public ornament i suppose even a timber yard besides  they did not indeed mention the timber yard in their memorial but the design plainly appears by a clause in the bill to regulate the height of the piles of timber etc  they did not fail however to demand of the city as much space as they thought necessary for their intended timber yard and they were pleased at the same time to desire the concurrence of the city as conservators of the river to their petition in parliament an insult this to the citizens of london as gross and enormous as the encroachment itself  for in effect it was to desire the citizens to join in a petition to parliament against themselves that is in favor of and to establish and confirm a notorious trespass committed in defiance of their own repeated prohibitions and presentiments  the memorial however was rejected with a proper disdain but this was no hindrance to the adventurers they were already sufficiently aware that they might affront the city with impunity  they knew their party interest in parliament and the partiality has hitherto been proved by the success  two great law lords strenuously endeavored to palliate the offense and to set forth the public utility of the embankment one of them admitted that the present scheme was intended for the private emolument of mess adams but then said he that emolument could only increase in proportion to the convenience and public utility of the embankment if it was found inconvenient the intended use would be lost consequently their profit would go with it it was therefore in every point a great public good arising from a private advantage however plausible this argument may seem yet i must observe that it ill becomes any gentleman at the head of the law to view a public good through the medium of a private advantage especially as that private advantage had been sought by a manifest public injury and trespass for when the encroachment first began the right of the city of london was so far from being disputed that the trespassers themselves acknowledged it by petitioning for leave and though they could not obtain leave from those who had a right to give it yet they continued to enlarge their enormous trespass as confidently as if the whole river was indisputably their own but even if the imaginary public good supposed by the learned chief justice be admitted yet his lordship knows that that which is otherwise good and just in itself becomes wicked and unjust if it is sought or obtained by force or fraud quod alias bonum and justum est si per vim vel fraudem petatur malum et injustum efficitur   c    and his lordship will not i apprehend deny that an enormous trespass has been committed and therefore those that are robbed and injured ought before all things to be reinstated and have their rights restored spoliatus debet ante omnia restitui   just     law justice and equity cannot show the least favor or consideration for the delinquents in such a case because iniquity bars equity  and no man can take advantage from his own trespass or injury nullus commodum capere potest de injuria sua propria co lit      the public good requires that bad actions should not remain

such adventurers if i had as much party interest and paid as little regard to the difference between meum and tuum as they have done in the present case or their advocates i would procure an elegant plan for raising such a building as should not only be a public ornament in its structure but a public convenience in its accommodations within and without in short i would build a noble inn open to all men for my own and the public advantage upon the inheritance of lord a lord b or of any other noble freeholder whatsoever whose property in point of situation might seem to promise the most advantage to my undertaking  or a good plan for raising an elegant and outwardly ornamental edifice inwardly adapted to the purposes of grinding corn slitting iron making gunpowder or any other articles necessary for the sustenance convenience or protection of the public would equally answer my private advantage and a good mill would be a good inheritance let me tell you if i could make it my own freehold wherever i pleased to build one with or without the consent of the lord of the manor or the lawful proprietor of the ground  the same doctrine may be extended even to the building of whole towns upon other mens ground without leave because the towns would be for the accommodation of gentlemen of tradesmen of manufacturers artificers etc etc etc whereby the public would manifestly be benefited as well as the builder in proportion to the success of each undertaking in the increase of inhabitants  if the lawful proprietor of the ground on which i trespassed would be pleased to give me his consent it would be well and if he refused it my pretensions would still be as good as the much favored cause of the trespassers at durhamyord for even though i should be obliged to allow that my present scheme was intended for the private emolument of myself  yet i could allege the opinion of a chief justice that this emolument could only increase in proportion to the convenience and public utility of my inn my mill or my town if it was found inconvenient the intended use would be lost consequently my profit would go with it it would therefore according to this opinion of my lord chief justice be in every point a great public good arising from a private advantage  i might allege also that this private advantage of mine ought to be much more favored than that of the encroachers on the river thames because if i should raise my prices for provisions for grinding for rent etc upon the public there would still be room sufficient in the neighborhood  as the consent of proprietors is at present esteemed unnecessary for other people also to trespass and build more inns more mills or more towns for their own and the public advantage as near to my advantageous situation as they should think proper so that the public when imposed upon by me might be enabled to give the preserence to cheaper and less unconscionable trespassers  but in the other case the local advantages are more limited and confined to a particular situation and the encroachments are already so great that there is scarcely room for more within any advantageous distance because the advantage of situation for wharfs is confined within the extent of the trading part of the town now fully occupied and the port or basin of the river within these bounds is already too much contracted to admit of more encroachments without encumbering or stopping up the passage of the river with craft and vessels which even at present are greatly endangered for want of commodious and proper mooringplaces out of the stream and tideway  during the frosty weather this last winter   or   ships were wrecked and many others damaged even in the port of london for want of such proper accommodations and a very considerable number of barges lighters etc were forced away from their moorings by the ice and lost both above and below london bridge so that it is manifest that waterroom is of much more consequence to the port of london than any land gained from it can possibly be and that there cannot therefore be any room to spare for making more wharfs out of the bed of the river without an apparent injury to the harbor so that if the new wharfs should become absolutely necessary by an increase of trade the public utility must submit to the exactions of the private possessor whose tenure is founded in public injury and injustice and the trade of this great city on which its very existence depends must be loaded and clogged with the much favored private advantage of each trespasser so that we may fairly measure by the enormity of the present encroachments how conscientiously trespassers in general would deign to consider the trade and rights of the public when their own private interest is in
