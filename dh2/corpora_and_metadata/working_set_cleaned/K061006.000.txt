the shortestway with the dissenters or proposals for the establishment of the church  london printed in the year mdccii  the shortestway with the dissenters etc sir roger lestrange tell us a story in his collection of fables of the cock and the horses the cock was gotten to roost in the stable among the horses and there being no racks or other conveniences for him it seems he was forced to roost upon the ground the horses jostling about for room and putting the cock in danger of his life he gives them this grave advice pray gentlefolks let us stand still for fear we should tread upon one another  there are some people in the world who now they are unpearcht and reduced to an equality with other people and under strong and very just apprehensions of being further treated as they deserve begin with aesopscock to preach up peace and union and the christian duties of moderation forgetting that when they had the power in their hands those graces were strangers in their gates  it is now near fourteen years that the glory and peace of the purest and most flourishing church in the world has been eclipsed buffetted and disturbed by a sort of men who god in his providence has suffered to insult over her and bring her down these have been the days of her humiliation and tribulation she has born with an invincible patience the reproach of the wicked and god has at last heard her prayers and delivered her from the oppression of the stranger  and now they find their day is over their power gone and the throne of this nation possessed by a royal english true and ever constant member of and friend to the church of england now they find that they are in danger of the church of englands just resentments now they cry out peace union forbearance and charity as if the church had not too long harbored her enemies under her wing and nourished the viperous brood till they hiss and fly in the face of the mother that cherished them  no gentlemen the time of mercy is past your day of grace is over you should have practiced peace and moderation and charity if you expected any your selves  we have heard none of this lesson for fourteen years past we have been huffd and bullyd with your act of tolleration you have told us that you are the church established by law as well as others have set up your cantingsynagogues at our churchdoors and the church and her members have been loaded with reproaches with oaths associations abjurations and what not where has been the mercy the forbearance the charity you have shown to tender consciences of the church of england that could not take oaths as fast as you made em that having sworn allegiance to their lawful and rightful king could not dispense with that oath their king being still alive and swear to your new hodgepodge of a dutchgovernment these have been turned out of their livings and they and their families left to starve their estates double taxed to carry on a war they had no hand in and you got nothing by what account can you give of the multitudes you have forced to comply against their consciences with your new sophistical politics who like the new converts in france sin because they cannot starve and now the tables are turned upon you you must not be persecuted it is not a christian spirit  you have butchered one king deposed another king and made a mock king of a third and yet you could have the face to expect to be employed and trusted by the fourth any body that did not know the temper of your party would stand amazed at the impudence as well as folly to think of it  your management of your dutch monarch whom you reduced to a mere king of cl  s is enough to give any future princes such an idea of your principles as to warn them sufficiently from coming into your clutches and god be thanked the queen is out of your hands knows you and will have a care of you  there is no doubt but the supreme authority of a nation has in its self a power and a right to that power to execute the laws upon any part of that nation it governs the execution of the known laws of the land and that with but a weak and gentle hand neither was all that the phanatical party of this land have ever called persecution this they have magnified to a height that the sufferings of the hugonots in france were not to be compared with  now to execute the known laws of a nation upon those who transgress them after having first been voluntarily consenting to the making those laws can never be called persecution but justice but justice is always violence to the party offending for every man is innocent in his own eyes the first execution of the laws against dissenters in england was in the days of king james the first and what did it amount to truly the worst they suffered was at their own request to let them go to new england and erect a new collony and give them great privileges grants and suitable powers keep them under protection and defend them against all invaders and receive no taxes or revenue from them this was the cruelty of the church of england fatal lenity twas the ruin of that excellent prince king charles the first had king james sent all the puritans in england away to the west indies we had been a national unmixed church the church of england had been kept undivided and entire  to requite the lenity of the father they take up arms against the son conquer pursue take imprison and at last put to death the anointed of god and destroy the very being and nature of government setting up a sordid impostor who had neither title to govern nor understanding to manage but supplied that want with power bloody and desperate councils and craft without conscience  had not king james the first witheld the full execution of the laws had he given them strict justice he had cleared the nation of them and the consequences had been plain his son had never been murdered by them nor the monarchy overwhelmed twas too much mercy shown them was the ruin of his posterity and the ruin of the nations peace one would think the dissenters should not have the face to believe that we are to be wheedld and canted into peace and toleration when they know that they have once requited us with a civil war and once with an intolerable and unrighteous persecution for our former civillity  nay to encourage us to be easy with them it is apparent that they never had the upperhand of the church but they treated her with all the severity with all the reproach and contempt as was possible what peace and what mercy did they show the loyal gentry of the church of england in the time of their triumphant commonwealth how did they put all the gentry of england to ransom whether they were actually in arms for the king or not making people compound for their estates and starve their families how did they treat the clergy of the church of england sequestered the ministers devoured the patrimony of the church and divided the spoil by sharing the church lands among their soldiers and turning her clergy out to starve just such measure as they have mete should be measured to them again  charity and love is the known doctrine of the church of england and it is plain she has put it in practice toward the dissenters even beyond what they ought till she has been wanting to her self and in effect unkind to her own sons particularly in the too much lenity of king james the first mentioned before had he so rooted the puritans from the face of the land which he had an opportunity early to have done they had not the power to vex the church as since they have done  in the days of king charles the second how did the church reward their bloody doings with lenity and mercy except the barbarous regicides of the pretended court of justice not a soul suffered for all the blood in an unnatural war king charles came in all mercy and love cherished them preferred them employed them witheld the rigor of the law and oftentimes even against the advice of his parliament gave them liberty of conscience and how did they requite him with the villainous contrivance to depose and murder him and his successor at the ryeplot  king james as if mercy was the inherent quality of the family began his reign with unusual favor to them nor could their joining with the duke of monmouth against him move him to do himself justice upon them but that mistaken prince thought to win them by gentleness and love proclaimed an universal liberty to them and rather discountenanced the church of england than them how they requited him all the world knows  the late reign is too fresh in the memory of all the world to need a comment how under pretense of joining with the church in redressing some grievances they pusht things to that extremity in conjunction with some mistaken gentlemen as to depose the late king as if the grievance of the nation could not have been redressed but by the absolute ruin of the prince here is an instance of their temper their peace and charity to what height they carried themselves during the reign of a king of their own how they crope into all places of trust and profit how they insinuated into the favor of the king and were at first preferred to the highest places in the nation how they engrost the ministry and above all how pitifully they managed is too plain to need any remarks  but particularly their mercy and charity the spirit of union they tell us so much of has been remarkable in scotland if any man would see the spirit of a dissenter let him look into scotland there they made an entire conquest of the church trampled down the sacred orders and suppressed the episcopal government with an absolute and as they suppose irretrievable victory though it is possible they may find themselves mistaken now twoud be a very proper question to ask their impudent advocate the observator pray how much mercy and favor did the members of the episcopal church find in scotland from the scotch presbyteriangovernment and i shall undertake for the church of england that the dissenters shall still receive as much here though they deserve but little  in a small treatise of the sufferings of the episcopal clergy in scotland twill appear what usage they met with how they not only lost their livings but in several places were plundered and abused in their persons the ministers that could not conform turned out with numerous families and no maintenance and hardly charity enough left to relieve them with a bit of bread and the cruelties of the party are innumerable and not to be attempted in this short piece  and now to prevent the distant cloud which they perceived to hang over their heads from england with a true presbyterian policy they put in for a union of nations that england might unite their church with the kirk of scotland and their presbyterian members sit in our house of commons and their assembly of scotch canting longcloaks in our convocation what might have been if our phanatick whiggishstatesmen had continued god only knows but we hope we are out of fear of that now  it is alleged by some of the faction and they began to bully us with it that if we will not unite with them they will not settle the crown with us again but when her majesty dies will choose a king for themselves  if they will not we must make them and it is not the first time we have let them know that we are able the crowns of these kingdoms have not so far disowned the right of succession but they may retrieve it again and if scotland thinks to come off from a successive to an elective state of government england has not promised not to assist the right heir and put them into possession without any regard to their ridiculous settlements  these are the gentlemen these their ways of treating the church both at home and abroad now let us examine the reasons they pretend to give why we should be favorable to them why we should continue and tolerate them among us  first they are very numerous they say they are a great part of the nation and we cannot suppress them  to this may be answered   they are not so numerous as the protestants in france and yet the french king effectually cleared the nation of them at once and we dont find he misses them at home  but i am not of the opinion they are so numerous as is pretended their party is more numerous than their persons and those mistaken people of the church who are misled and deluded by their wheedling artifices to join with them make their party the greater but those will open their eyes when the government shall set heartily about the work and come off from them as some annimals which they say always desert a house when it is likely to fall    dly the more numerous the more dangerous and therefore the more need to suppress them and god has suffered us to bear them as goads in our sides for not utterly extinguishing them long ago    dly if we are to allow them only because we cannot suppress them then it ought to be tried whether we can or no and i am of opinion it is easy to be done and could prescribe ways and means if it were proper but i doubt not but the government will find effectual methods for the rooting the contagion from the face of this land  another argument they use which is this that it is a time of war and we have need to unite against the common enemy  we answer this common enemy had been no enemy if they had not made him so he was quiet in peace and no way disturbed or encroachd upon us and we know no reason we had to quarrel with him  but further we make no question but we are able to deal with this common enemy without their help but why must we unite with them because of the enemy will they go over to the enemy if we do not prevent it by a union with them  we are very well contented they should and make no question we shall be ready to deal with them and the common enemy too and better without them than with them  besides if we have a common enemy there is the more need to be secure against our private enemies if there is one common enemy we have the less need to have an enemy in our bowels  twas a great argument some people used against suppressing the oldmoney that twas a time of war and twas too great a risque for the nation to run if we should not master it we should be undone and yet the sequel proved the hazard was not so great but it might be mastered and the success was answerable the suppressing the dissenters is not a harder work nor a work of less necessity to the public we can never enjoy a settled uninterrupted union and tranquillity in this nation till the spirit of whiggisme faction and schism is melted down like the oldmoney  to talk of the difficulty is to frighten our selves with chimaeras and notions of a powerful party which are indeed a party without power difficulties often appear greater at a distance than when they are searched into with judgment and distinguished from the vapors and shadows that attend them  we are not to be frightened with it this age is wiser than that by all our own experience and theires too king charles the first had early suppressed this party if he had took more deliberate measures in short it is not worth arguing to talk of their arms their monmouths and shaftsburys and argiles are gone their dutchsanctuary is at an end heaven has made way for their destruction and if we do not close with the divine occasion we are to blame our selves and may remember that we had once an opportunity to serve the church of england by extirpating her implacable enemies and having let slip the minute that heaven presented may experimentally complain post est occasio calvo  here are some popular objections in the way  as first the queen has promised them to continue them in their tolerated liberty and has told us she will be a religious observer of her word  what her majesty will do we cannot help but what as the head of the church she ought to do is another case her majesty has promised to protect and defend the church of england and if she cannot effectually do that without the destruction of the dissenters she must of course dispense with one promise to comply with another but to answer this cavil more effectually her majesty did never promise to maintain the tolleration to the destruction of the church but it is upon supposition that it may be compatible with the well being and safety of the church which she had declared she would take especial care of now if these two interests clash it is plain her majestys intentions are to uphold protect defend and establish the church and this we conceive is impossible  perhaps it may be said that the church is in no immediate danger from the dissenters and therefore it is time enough but this is a weak answer  for first if a danger be real the distance of it is no argument against but rather a spur to quicken us to prevention lest it be too late hereafter  and  dly here is the opportunity and the only one perhaps that ever the church had to secure her self and destroy her enemies  the representatives of the nation have now an opportunity the time is come which all good men have wished for that the gentlemen of england may serve the church of england now they are protected and encouraged by a church of england queen  what will ye do for your sister in the day that she shall be spoken for  if ever you will establish the best christian church in the world  if ever you will suppress the spirit of enthusiasm  if ever you will free the nation from the viperons brood that have so long sucked the blood of their mother  if you will leave your posterity free from faction and rebellion this is the time  this is the time to pull up this heretical weed of sedition that has so long disturbed the peace of our church and poisoned the good corn  but says another hot and cold objector this is renewing fire and faggot reviving the act de heret comburendo this will be cruelty in its nature and barbarous to all the world  i answer it is cruelty to kill a snake or a toad in cold blood but the poison of their nature makes it a charity to our neighbors to destroy those creatures not for any personal injury received but for prevention not for the evil they have done but the evil they may do  serpents toads vipers etc are noxious to the body and poison the sensative life these poison the soul corrupt our posterity ensnare our children destroy the vitals of our happyness our future felicity and contaminate the whole mass  shall any law be given to such wild creatures some beasts are for sport and the huntsmen give them advantages of ground but some are knocked on head by all possible ways of violence and surprise  i do not prescribe fire and faggot but a scipio said of carthage dilenda est carthago they are to be rooted out of this nation if ever we will live in peace serve god or enjoy our own as for the manner i leave it to those hands who have a right to execute gods justice on the nations and the churchs enemies  but if we must be frighted from this justice under the specious pretenses and odious sense of cruelty nothing will be effected twill be more barbarous and cruel to our own children and dear posterity when they shall reproach their fathers as we do ours and tell us you had an opportunity to root out this cursed race from the world under the favor and protection of a true english queen and out of your foolish pity you spared them because forsooth you would not be cruel and now our church is suppressed and persecuted our religion trampled under foot our estates plundered our persons imprisoned and dragged to jails gibbets and scaffolds your sparing this amalakite race is our destruction your mercy to them proves cruelty to your poor posterity  how just will such reflections be when our posterity shall fall under the merciless clutches of this uncharitable generation when our church shall be swallowed up in schism faction enthusiasme and confusion when our government shall be devolved upon foreigners and our monarchy dwindled into a republic  twoud be more rational for us if we must spare this generation to summon our own to a general massacre and as we have brought them into the world free send them out so and not betray them to destruction by our supine negligence and then cry it is mercy  moses was a merciful meek man and yet with what fury did he run through the camp and cut the throats of three and thirty thousand of his dear israelites that were fallen into idolatry what was the reason twas mercy to the rest to make these be examples to prevent the destruction of the whole army  how many millions of future souls we save from infection and delusion if the present race of poisoned spirits were purged from the face of the land  it is vain to trifle in this matter the light foolish handling of them by mulcts fines etc it is their glory and their advantage if the gallows instead of the counter and the galleys instead of the fines were the reward of going to a conventicle to preach or hear there would not be so many sufferers the spirit of martyrdom is over they that will go to church to be chosen sheriffs and mayors would go to forty churches rather than be hanged  if one severe law were made and punctually executed that who ever was found at a conventicle should be banished the nation and the preacher be hanged we should soon see an end of the tale they would all come to church and one age would make us all one again  to talk of   s a month for not coming to the sacrament and   s per week for not coming to church this is such a way of converting people as never was known this is felling them a liberty to transgress for so much money if it be not a crime why dont we give them full license and if it be no price ought to compound for the committing it for that is selling a liberty to people to sin against god and the government  if it be a crime of the highest consequence both against the peace and welfare of the nation the glory of god the good of the church and the happyness of the soul let us rank it among capital offenses and let it receive a punishment in proportion to it  we hang men for trifles and banish them for things not worth naming but an offense against god and the church against the welfare of the world and the dignity of religion shall be bought off for   s this is such a shame to a christian government that it is with regret i transmit it to posterity  if men sin against god affront his ordinances rebel against his church and disobey the precepts of their superiors let them suffer as such capital crimes deserve so will religion on flourish and this divided nation be once again united  and yet the title of barbarous and cruel will soon be taken off from this law too i am not supposing that all the dissenters in england should be hanged or banished but as in cases of rebellions and insurrections if a few of the ringleaders suffer the multitude are dismissed so a few obstinate people being made examples there is no doubt but the severity of the law would find a stop in the compliance of the multitude  to make the reasonableness of this matter out of question and more unanswerably plain let us examine for what it is that this nation is divided into parties and factions and let us see how they can justify a separation or we of the church of england can justify our bearing the insults and inconveniences of the party  one of their leading pastors and a man of as much learning as most among them in his answer to a pamphlet entitled a enquiry into the occasional conformity has these words p    do the religion of the church and the meeting houses make two religions wherein do they differ the substance of the same religion is common to them both and the modes and accidents are the things in which only they differ p    thirty nine articles are given us for the summary of our religion thirty six contain the substance of it wherein we agree three the additional appendices about which we have some differences  now if as by their own acknowledgment the church of england is a true church and the difference between them is only a few modes and accidents why should we expect that they will suffer gallows and galleys corporeal punishment and banishment for these trifles there is no question but they will be wiser even their own principles will not bear them out in it they will certainly comply with the laws and with reason and though at the first severity may seem hard the next age will feel nothing of it the contagion will be rooted out the disease being cured there will be no need of the operation but if they should venture to trangress and fall into the pit all the world must condemn their obstinacy as being without ground from their own principles  thus the pretense of cruelty will be taken off and the party actually suppressed and the disquiets they have so often brought upon the nation prevented  their numbers and their wealth makes them haughty and tha it is so far from being an argument to persuade us to forbear them that it is a warning to us without any more delay to reconcile them to the unity of the church or remove them from us  at present heaven be praised they are not so formidable as they have been and it is our own fault if ever we suffer them to be so providence and the church of england seems to join in this particular that now the destroyers of the nations peace may be overturned and to this end the present opportunity seems to be put into our hands  to this end her present majesty seems reserved to enjoy the crown that the ecclesiastic as well as civil rights of the nation may be restored by her hand  to this end the face of affairs have received such a turn in the process of a few months as never has been before the leading men of the nation the universal cry of the people the unanimous request of the clergy agree in this that the deliverance of our church is at hand  for this end has providence given us such a parliament such a convocation such a gentry and such a queen as we never had before  and what may be the consequences of a neglect of such opportunities the succession of the crown has but a dark prospect another dutch turn may make the hopes of it ridiculous and the practice impossible be the house of our future princes never so well inclined they will be foreigners and many years will be spent in suiting the genius of strangers to the crown and to the interests of the nation and how many ages it may be before the english throne be filled with so much zeal and candor so much tenderness and hearty affection to the church as we see it now covered with who can imagine  it is high time then for the friends of the church of england to think of building up and establishing her in such a manner that she may be no more invaded by foreigners nor divided by factions schisms and error  if this could be done by gentle and easy methods i should be glad but the wound is coroded the vitals begin to mortify and nothing but amputation of members can complete the cure all the ways of tenderness and compassion all persuasive arguments have been made use of in vain  the humor of the dissenters has so increased among the people that they hold the church in defiance and the house of god is an abomination among them nay they have brought up their posterity in such prepossest aversions to our holy religion that the ignorant mob think we are all idolaters and worshippers of baal and account it a sin to come within the walls of our churches  the primitive christians were not more shie of a heathentemple or of meat offered to idols nor the jews of swinesflesh than some of our dissenters are of the church and the divine service solemnized therein  this obstinacy must be rooted out with the profession of it while the generation are left at liberty daily to affront god almighty and dishonor his holy worship we are wanting in our duty to god and our mother the church of england  how can we answer it to god to the church and to our posterity to leave them entangled with fanaticisme error and obstinacy in the bowels of the nation to leave them an enemy in their streets that in time may involve them in the same crimes and endanger the utter extirpation of religion in the nation  what is the difference betwixt this and being subjected to the power of the church of rome from whence we have reformed if one be an extreme on one hand and one on another it is equally destructive to the truth to have errors settled among us let them be of what nature they will  both are enemies of our church and of our peace and why should it not be as criminal to admit an enthusiast as a jesuit why should the papist with his seven sacraments be worse than the quaker with no sacraments at all why should religioushouses be more intolerable than meeting houses  alas the church of england what with popery on one hand and schismatics on the other how has she been crucified between two thieves  now let us crucify the thieves let her foundations be established upon the destruction of her enemies the doors of mercy being always open to the returning part of the deluded people let the obstinate be ruled with the rod of iron  let all true sons of so holy an oppressed mother exasperated by her afflictions harden their hearts against those who have oppressed her  and may god almighty put it into the hearts of all the friends of truth to lift up a standard against pride and antichrist that the posterity of the sons of error may be rooted out from the face of this land for ever   finis
