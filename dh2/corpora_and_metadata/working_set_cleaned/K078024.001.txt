the natural history of british insects explaining them in their several states with the periods of their transformations their food economy etc  together with the history of such minute insects as require investigation by the microscope  the whole illustrated by colored figures designed and executed from living specimens  by e donovan f l s  in ten volumes vol i  london printed by bye and law st johns square clerkenwell for the author and for f and c rivington no    st pauls church yard  mdcccii  to t marsham and a mleay esqrs treasurer and secretary of the linnaean society my dear sirs if i were not anxious to acknowledge you amongst the number of those whose useful information has in various instances tended to improve this work motives of esteem would alone induce me to inscribe it to you the reflection that for ten years past it has been sanctioned with no inconsiderable share of public approbation will not allow me to believe it unworthy of your attention and its conclusion affords me the best opportunity to testify the favor as well as the respect with which  i remain most sincerely yours e donovan  advertisement at the conclusion of a work which has been published in a progressive manner and either in the form of monthly numbers or annual volumes has already passed the ordeal of public criticism the author can have little to advance in favor of the design or the manner in which it has been executed his chief object was to illustrate the science of entomology on a more extensive scale than had been previously attempted in this country and he trusts upon the whole his endeavors in this respect have not been fruitless  as a general history of the insect productions of great britain it is presumed this work will be found sufficiently copious and instructive for though the author has purposely avoided entering too deeply amongst the minutiae of the insect race he has been careful to include whatever is interesting the selection of papiliones or butterflies is extremely ample as well as that of the sphinges or hawk moths none of the larger kinds of phalaeuae or moth tribes have been overlooked and the number of those of an inferior size that are extremely rare or particularly beautiful are altogether considerable those are chiefly alluded to because general observers are more immediately interested with the uncommon elegance of the lepidopterous tribes than any others in general however the reader will meet with some information in every department as nothing material in any cabinet to which he has access has been omitted  the arrangement of the subjects is for the most part conformable to the system of linnaeus with occasional reference to the writings of fabricius this is designed to assist the labors of the practical entomologist and by combining novelty with beauty and scientific information may induce many other attentive observers of nature to pursue this pleasing and interesting study  the author cannot but feel some degree of satisfaction in having at least fulfilled the chief object of his first design and after the labor of ten years completed a work perhaps the most extensive that may ever appear in this form on the subject of british entomology but this consideration will not permit him to entirely abandon his favorite pursuit his attention will be still directed to a science in which the past indulgence of a liberal public have induced him to believe he may still be useful and though he cannot consistently with the conditions of this undertaking extend it further at this time should a sufficient number of new and valuable species occur he will certainly be tempted to transgress and make some addition to the present selection  alphabetical table of contents absinthii phalaena plate

birds covered with feathers iii amphibia lungs arbitrary iv pisces fishes breath by gills not arbitrarily v insecta insects two antennae or feelers those feelers are the two horns that are affixed to the head  vi vermes no head insects therefore compose the fifth class in the system and are divided into seven orders  order i coleoptera wings two covered by two shells divided by a longitudinal future ii hemiptera shells or covers of the wings somewhat soft and incumbent on each other iii lepidoptera wings four imbricated with minute scales iv neuroptera wings four naked transparent reticulated with veins or nerves tail without sting v hymenoptera wings four membraneous tail of the female armed with a sting vi diptera wings two vii aptera no wings transformations of insects many of our readers are no doubt acquainted with the singular transformations insects undergo but we trust those will pardon a digression which may be useful to those who have not that knowledge and without premising farther we proceed to inform them that insects in general undergo a material change in their form at stated periods of their lives there are some though few which burst forth from the egg perfectly formed as spiders etc but the greater part exist in four several states the first that of the egg whence the larva or caterpillar is produced it is at first very minute but in this state it feeds some kinds on one or two plants only others promiscuously on many they therefore continue to increase in size moulting several times the outer skin until the destined period of their dormant state approaches they then spin a web more or less strong according to the species and are converted into the aurelia or chrysalis and lastly they burst forth in due season perfectly formed it is under this form they propagate a future race and themselves perish as they rarely survive the inclemencies of the winter  the ancient naturalists held suppositions very imperfect and erroneous relative to those transformations but malpighi and swammerdam proved by many accurate examinations clearly that those changes were not suddenly effected but gradual and that under the form of the caterpillar they could distinguish the future changes the insect would undergo   plate i phalaena pavonia emperor moth lepidoptera insects of the lepidoptera order are divided into three genera papilio sphinx and phalaena butterflies hawk moths and moths the characters of the two former hereafter those of the phalaena are  generic character the antennae setaceous decreasing in size from the base to the apex the wings when at rest are generally contracted they fly in the night  specific character antennae feathered no trunk wings expanded horizontal rounded entire with a large eye in the center of each the first redbrown waved the second orange the antennae of the male are broader and the wings of the female larger waved with black and white and bordered with yellow caterpillar green or yellow spinous on thorns and brambles length of the moth one inch  berken out  the conformity and likeness which prevails between the male and female throughout the greater part of the animal system cannot however in insects be implicitly depended on the difference in many is such as even to mislead some very accurate entomologists the illustrious linnaeus not excepted in this species it is not so great as in many but such as entitles the female to a figure in a future plate our figure is of the male  albin  plate    subject    has given a figure of the male and female on the same plate and describes a male to have changed to the aurelia state as in our plate represented july    and march    following to have produced the fly but the time of their appearance depends on the proportion of heat or cold as the authors subject was preserved from the severity of winter in a warm room the usual time to find them in the caterpillar state is august and in april the fly  the singular provision which nature makes for the protection of this fly deserves particular notice when the time of its continuation in the caterpillar state is expired by much labor it forms a kind of bag or purse of a very tough substance this it fixes against the trunks of trees etc by a number of hairs or filaments which remain on the external surface it lines the outer case by one of a finer texture the top of which is closed by several bristles that unite in the center exactly representing a cap and excludes almost the possibility of its receiving an injury during this defenseless state in this bag it passes to the aurelia and remains until the birth of the perfect insect  our figure represents the chrysalis or aurelia in the bag part appears torn away to exhibit its situation therein  were we to unite the several accounts of authors respecting its food it would appear to be a general feeder it will live on the rose the elm and the willow and on thorns and brambles particularly   plate ii fig i monoculus quaricornis aptera apterous insects are distinguished chiefly by having no wings in either male or female  generic character the feet are formed for swimming the body is covered with a crustaceous case or shell the eyes fixed in the shell very near each other  specific character gray brown one eye antennae four body diminishes toward the tail which is long and bifid with three or four strong hairs on each side a bag of eggs on each side of the tail length half a line  berk out  although this insect may have been noticed by many swimming or rather darting swiftly in various directions in water its minuteness is such that the most attentive could never have comprehended precisely its component parts but the microscope discovers it to be an animal of such singular formation as highly to deserve the attention of the naturalist it is covered by a firm crustaceous substance divided into annulations and armed in several parts with spines and bristles notwithstanding which this shell is so transparent that the whole motion of the intestines is very visible by a good magnifier  it must be granted that but for the microscope the wonders of the minute creation would be to us entirely unknown our ideas could never suppose the existence of those animated forms which occupy the immeasurable space between an apparent atom and nothing the myriads of animals thousands of times smaller than a mite must evade our cognizance and be an actual conviction of their nonexistence  but with all the utility that the microscope can boast no instrument is so likely to mislead the most accurate observer particularly if not in the habit of using it the variations of light the difference of the magnifying powers or the damage the glasses may meet with by accident such as requires every one to examine with the greatest care one degree of light may bring an object to view whilst another may entirely blend it with the fluid it exists in or one glass may discover spines on an object another glass might have represented perfectly smooth it is therefore necessary to begin with a small power in proportion to the size of the object and to proceed to deeper magnifiers after  there is some difference in our figure and those either of barbut or of baker which appears chiefly from our using a single lens nearly of the deepest power convenient to use our glasses were the  0th and  0th of an inch focus  we very attentively examined the eyes and found not one but two placed near each other on a scale or plate of a black color hence arises the appearance of a single eye by a small magnifying power  the tail presents a forked appearance by a deep power and the eggs are contained in two bags one on each side the tail the color varies probably in proportion to the nature of its food to pale green more or less of a red or of a gray brown color  fig ii this minute animalcula is frequent in stagnant water or in infusions of vegetables and is one species of those whose existence can only be discovered by a good microscope it is very difficult considering the power those creatures have to distort their true form at pleasure to fix their distinguishing character therefore where the definition appears dubious we prefer being silent rather than hazard an error  fig   represents them magnified as they sometimes seem to follow the leader in herds but perhaps it is only the scent of the prey that induces each to follow the foremost as they frequently swim or whirl in the water separately with great swiftness

specific character enclosed in a bivalve ashcolored shell from the aperture of which it puts forth a number of capillary antennae which it retracts when taken out of the water  to acquire a proper knowledge of the formation of this minute insect it is necessary to use a microscope with a glass stage for objects or rather such as admit of nicely adjusting a talc as occasion may require the insect to be taken from the water with a camelhair pencil and carefully placed on the talc after which it may be examined by a magnifier of   0 of an inch focus but in proceeding to a deeper power let the talc be turned the upper surface with the insect in the drop of the fluid from the lens and thereby the lens may approach the object to its proper focus without this caution the lens would be frequently immerged in the water and entirely obstruct the sight  in the adult state the opacity of the bivalve shell its external covering so entirely obscures the internal motion that nothing except the filaments it throws from the aperture or opening is visible by the microscope  it breaks from the egg perfectly formed but very minute and transparent this is therefore the best time to discover its structure and from one in this state we have taken our figure  by the antennae it directs its course as does the monoculus quadricornis and like it also it has two eyes fixed in the shell but it can completely envelop its head in its bivalve covering its mouth is beneath but the numerous filaments it darts forth causes such a violent motion in the water that the minuter insects are unresistingly drawn between them and forced to the mouth  the motion of its lungs is very visible as are also the vesse ramlsfying thence its food is carried to and digested in the deepcoloured tube or intestine and the refuse is discharged by a sudden jerk from the extremity of the tube or anus  thus it exists a life of rapine and destruction enjoyed at the expense of the lives of thousands and as the objects of its ravenous disposition are defenseless so are they the sport of their conqueror the few moments of intermission its craving appetite grants them is occupied equally in the spoil first pressing them to death and then tossing them undevoured into the fluid  but should a more powerful insect oppose him he immediately contracts his parts and nothing more than the external covering is open to his antagonists violence and he will sooner die ignobly than offer the least opposition  fig ii this animalcule is very minute and appears like a fine membrane without intestines

the sixspot is taken near the environs of london where the other is rarely if ever found and in some parts of bedfordshire the fivespot is very common  as all lepidopterous insects undergo some trifling alterations from attendant circumstances so specimens of the female sp filipendulae has been taken with the two spots near the base of the wing closely united and hence arose some doubt as to the existence of any other fivespot burnet the two kinds must not however be compared to entertain this supposition as the fivespot is not only smaller the margin of the inferior wings deeper but wants that spot of red nearest the apex of the superior wings and which must immediately appear on the slightest inspection  the caterpillars of most insects of this genus are armed with a spine or

which in some directions of light assume a golden appearance and on each wing are five elegantly disposed spots of white having each a center of the most beautiful bloom or blossom color which blend into the white with the most exquisite softness the under wings are of a simple color and have only a transverse shade of a darker hue across the middle of each wing  its truly elegant appearance would alone be sufficient to claim our attention but when we add that it is one of the rarest and most valuable specimens of british entomology it will be considered as a compensation for those more common subjects occasionally introduced and which the nature of our plan cannot permit us to refuse  our endeavors to procure the caterpillar have hitherto been ineffectual although it is very probably to be taken early in the season feeding on the bramble it is described to be a brown larva naked or without hairs with a gibbosity or rising on the back near the extremity  our fly was taken

insects and particularly those of the coleopterous order that unless they are in some measure magnified much of their beauty will remain hidden and much of their structure be enveloped in obscurity it is not perfectly agreeable to our plan and may admit of some blame from our subscribers but when objects so diminutive in size and so complex in color offer to our attention and it is not possible to represent them in their natural appearance or in a manner satisfactory to ourselves we must have recourse to the microscope for assistance we consider the confidence at present reposed in our accuracy and attention to the natural subjects evident from the general patronage bestowed on our attempt it is a spur to our exertions and we will endeavor as well by our future as present correctness to deserve a continuation of that esteem and encouragement so liberally showered on our once arduous undertaking  c bachus is near  in length the shells and thorax appear of a deep glossy purple with much inclination to gold a green and golden hue is seen on every part of the body as it moves in various directions of light the whole appears before the microscope besprinkled and spotted with gold and purple gold in those parts where the light is most powerful and purple in the shadows the snout is black or of a dark color as are also the eyes and the singular structure of the jointed antennae

are many inferior to it both in elegance and color the whole of the body is a deep purplish blue which reflects on one part a most brilliant color with a greenish cast and the clouds on the wings contribute much to its luster the thorax and head are nearly the same some few shades of green excepted  it is found in may and june sporting on the waters or among the bushes which overgrow the sides of pools or gently flowing streams at noon or after a shower when the sun breaks from its watery prison and penetrates the thickets and the groves with inviting warmth they are seen issuing from the dark retreat and overhanging shrubbery to bask and wanton in its effulgent beams and fan the gently rising breeze with their lucid wings in many parts on the banks of the thames they heighten the
