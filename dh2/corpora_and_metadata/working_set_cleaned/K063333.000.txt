proposals for printing the art of political lying in two volumes  proposals for printing a very curious discourse in two volumes in quarto entitled pseydologia politik or a treatise of the art of political lying with an abstract of the first volume of the said treatise  london printed for john morphew near stationers hall      price  d  there is now in the press a curious piece entitled pseudologia politic or a treatise of the art of political lying consisting of two volumes in  to  the proposals are i that if the author meets with suitable encouragement he intends to deliver the first volume to the subscribers by hilaryterm next ii the price of both volumes will be to the subscribers fourteen shillings seven whereof are to be paid down and the other seven at the delivery of the second volume iii those that subscribe for six shall have a seventh gratis which reduces the price to less than six shillings a volume iv that the subscribers shall have their names and places of abode printed at length   subscriptions are taken in at st jamess coffeehouse young mans at charing cross the grecian brydgess by the royal exchange and most other coffeehouses in town  for the encouragement of so useful a work it is thought fit the public should be informed of the contents of the first volume by one who has with great care perused the manuscript the author in his preface makes some very judicious reflections upon the original of arts and sciences that at first they consist of scattered theorems and practices which are handed about amongst the masters and only revealed to the filii artis till such time as some great genius appears who collects these disjointed propositions and reduces them into a regular system that this is the case of that noble and useful art of political lying which in this last age having been enriched with several new discoveries ought not to lie any longer in rubbish and confusion but may justly claim a place in the encyclopedia especially such as serves for a model of education for an able politcian that he proposes to himself no small stock of fame in future ages in being the first who has undertaken this design and for the same reason he hopes the imperfection of his work will be excused he invites all persons who have any talent that way or any new discovery to communicate their thoughts assuring them that honorable mention shall be made of them in his work  the first volume consists of eleven chapters in the first chapter of his excellent treatise he reasons philosophically concerning the nature of the soul of man and those qualities which render it susceptible of lies he supposes the soul to be of the nature of a planocylindrical speculum or lookingglass that the plain side was made by god almighty but that the devil afterward wrought the other side into a cylindrical figure the plain side represents objects just as they are and the cylindrical side by the rules of catoptricks must needs represent true objects false and false objects true but the cylindrical side being much the larger surface takes in a greater compass of visual rays that upon the cylindrical side of the soul of man depends the whole art and success of political lying the author in this chapter proceeds to reason upon the other qualities of the mind as great fondness of the malicious and the miraculous the tendency of the soul toward the malicious springs from selflove or a pleasure to find mankind more wicked base or unfortunate than our selves the design of the miraculous proceeds from the inactivity of the soul or its incapacity to be moved or delighted with any thing that is vulgar or common the author having established the qualities of the mind upon which his art is founded he proceeds  in his second chapter to treat of the nature of political lying which he defines to be the art of convincing the people of salutary falsehoods for some good end he calls it an art to distinguish it from that of telling truth which does not seem to want art but then he would have this understood only as to the invention because there is indeed more art necessary to convince the people of a salutary truth than a salutary falsehood then he proceeds to prove that there are salutary falsehoods of which he gives a great many instances both before and after the revolution and demonstrates plainly that we could not have carried on the war so long without several of those salutary falsehoods he gives rules to calculate the value of a political lie in pounds shillings and pence by good he does not mean that which is absolutely so but what appears so to the artist which is a sufficient ground for him to proceed upon and he distinguishes the good as it commonly is into bonum utile dulce and honestum he shows you that there are political lies of a mixed nature which include all the three in different respects that the utile reigns generally about the exchange the dulce and honestum at the westminster end of the town one man spreads a lie to sell or buy stock to greater advantage a second because it is honorable to serve his party and a third because it is sweet to gratify his revenge having explained the several terms of his definition he proceeds  in his third chapter to treat of the lawfulness of political lying which he deduces from its true and genuine principles by enquiring into the several rights that mankind have to truth he shows that the people have a right to private truth from their neighbors and oeconomical truth from their own family that they should not be abused by their wives children and servants but that they have no right at all to political truth that the people may as well all pretend to be lords of manors and possess great estates as to have truth told them in matters of government the author with great judgment states the several shares of mankind in this matter of truth according to their several capacities dignities and professions and shows you that children have hardly any share at all in consequence of which they have very seldom any truth told them it must be owned that the author in this chapter has some seeming difficulties to answer and explain texts of scripture and a sermon lately preached before her majesty at windsor  the fourth chapter is wholly employed in this queston whether the right of coinage of political lies be wholly in the government the author who is a true friend to english liberty determines in the negative and answers all the arguments of the opposite party with great acuteness that as the government of england has a mixture of democratical in it so the right of inventing and spreading political lies is partly in the people and their obstinate adherence to this just privilege has been most conspicuous and shined with great luster of late years that it happens very often that there is no other means left to the good people of england to pull down a ministry and government they are weary of but by exercising this their undoubted right that abundance of political lying is a sure sign of true english liberty that as ministers do sometimes use tools to support their power it is but reasonable that the people should employ the same weapon to defend themselves and pull them down  in his fifth chapter he divides political lies into their several species and classes and gives precepts about the inventing spreading and propagating the several sorts of them he begins with the rumores and libelli famosi such as concern the reputation of men in power where he finds fault with the common mistake that takes notice only of one sort viz the detractory or defamatory whereas in truth there are three sorts the detractory the additory and the translatory the additory gives to a great man a greater share of reputation than belongs to him to enable him to serve some good end or purpose the detractory or defamatory is a lie which takes from a great man the reputation that justly belongs to him for fear he should use it to the detriment of the public the translatory is a lie that transfers the merit of a mans good action to another who is in himself more deserving or transfers the demerit of a bad action from the true author to a person who is in himself less deserving he gives several instances of very great strokes in all the three kinds especially in the last when it was necessary for the good of the public to bestow the valor and conduct of one man upon another and that of many to one man nay even upon a good occasion a man may be robbed of his victory by a person that did not command in the action the restoring and the destroying the public may be ascribed to persons who had no hand in either the author exhorts all gentlemen practitioners to exercise themselves in the translatory because the existence of the things themselves being visible and not demanding any proof there wants nothing to be put upon the public but a false author or a false cause which is no great presumption upon the credulity of mankind to whom the secret springs of things are for the most part unknown  the author proceeds to give some precepts as to the additory that when one ascribes any thing to a person which does not belong to him the lie ought to be calculated not quite contradictory to his known qualities ex gr one would not make the french king present at a protestant conventicle nor like queen elizabeth restore the overplus of taxes to her subjects one would not bring in the emperor giving two months pay in advance to his troops nor the dutch paying more than their quota one would not make the same person zealous for a standing army and public liberty nor an atheist support the church nor a lewd fellow a reformer of manners nor a hotheaded crackbraind coxcomb forward for a scheme of moderation but if it is absolutely necessary that a person is to have some good adventitious quality given him the authors precept is that it should not be done at first in extremo gradu for example they should not make a covetous man give away all at once five thousand pounds in a charitable generous way twenty or thirty pounds may suffice at first they should not introduce a person of remarkable ingratitude to his benefactors rewarding a poor man for some good office that was done him thirty years ago but they may allow him to acknowledge a service to a person who is capable still to do him another a man whose personal courage is suspected is not at first to drive whole squadrons before him but he may be allowed the merit of some squabble or throwing a bottle at his adversarys head  it will not be allowed to make a great man that is a known despiser of religion spend whole days in his closet at his devotion but you may with safety make him sit out public prayers with decency a great man who has never been known willingly to pay a just debt ought not all of a sudden to be introduced making restitution of thousands he has cheated let it suffice at first to pay twenty pounds to a friend who has lost his note  he lays down the same rules in the detractory or defamatory kind that they should not be quite opposite to the qualities the persons are supposed to have thus it will not be found according to the found rules of pseudology to report of a pious and religious prince that he neglects his devotion and would introduce heresy but you may report of a merciful prince that he has pardoned a criminal who did not deserve it you will be unsuccessful if you give out of a great man who is remarkable for his frugality for the public that he squanders away the nations money but you may safely relate that he hoards it you must not affirm he took a bribe but you may freely censure him for being tardy in his payments because though neither may be true yet the last is credible the first not of an openhearted generous minister you are not to say that he was in an intrigue to betray his country but you may affirm with some probability that he was in an intrigue with a lady he warns all practitioners to take good heed to these precepts for want of which many of their lies of late have proved abortive on shortlived  in his sixth chapter he treats of the miraculous by which he understands any thing that exceeds the common degrees of probability in respect of the people it is divided into two sorts the  or the  terrifying lies and animating or encouraging lies both being extremely useful on their proper occasions concerning the  he gives several rules one of which is that terrible objects should not be too frequently shown to the people lest they grow familiar he says it is absolutely necessary that the people of england should be frighted with the french king and the pretender once a year but that the bears should be chained up again till that time twelvemonth the want of observing this so necessary a precept in bringing out the rawhead and bloodybones upon every trifling occasion has produced great indifference in the vulgar of late years as to the animating or encouraging lies he gives the following rules that they should not far exceed the common degrees of probability and that there should be variety of them and the same lie not obstinately insisted upon that the promissory or prognosticating lies should not be upon short days for fear the authors should have the shame and confusion to see themselves speedily contradicted he examines by these rules that wellmeant but unfortunate lie of the conquest of france which continued near twenty years together but at last by being too obstinately insisted upon it was worn threadbare and became unsuccessful  as to the  or the prodigious he has little to advise but that their comets whales and dragons should be sizable their storms tempests and earthquakes without the reach of a days journey of a man and a horse  the seventh chapter is wholly taken up in an enquiry which of the two parties are the greatest artists in political lying he owns the tories have been better believed of late but that the whigs have much the greater geniuss amongst them he attributes the late ill success of the whigparty to their glutting the market and retailing too much of a bad commodity at once when there is too great a quantity of worms it is hard to catch gudgeons he proposes a scheme for the recovery of the credit of the whigparty which indeed seems to be somewhat chimerical and does not savor of that sound judgment the author has shown in the rest of the work it amounts to this that the party should agree to vent nothing but truth for three months together which will give them credit for six months lying afterward he owns that he believes it almost impossible to find fit persons to execute this scheme toward the end of the chapter he inveighs severely against the folly of parties in retaining such scoundrels and men of low geniuss to retail their lies such as most of the present newswriters are who besides a strong bent and inclination toward the profession seem to be wholly ignorant in the rules of pseudology and not at all qualified for so weighty a trust  in his eighth chapter he treats of some extraordinary geniuss who have appeared of late years especially in their disposition toward the miraculous he advises those hopeful young men to turn their invention to the service of their country it being inglorious at this time to employ their talent in prodigious foxchases horsecourses feats of activity in driving of coaches jumping running swallowing of peaches pulling out whole sets of teeth to clean etc when their country stands so much in need of their assistance  the eighth chapter is a project for uniting the several smaller corporations of liars into one society it is too tedious to give a full account of the whole scheme what is most remarkable is that this society ought to consist of the heads of each party that no lie is to pass current without their approbation they being the best judges of the present exigencies and what sort of lies are demanded that in such a corporation there ought to be men of all professions that the  and the  that is decency and probability may be observed as much as possible that besides the persons abovementioned this society ought to consist of the hopeful geniuss about the town of which there are great plenty to be picked up in the several coffeehouses travelers virtuosos foxhunters jockeys attorneys old seamen and soldiers out of the hospitals of greenwich and chelsea to this society so constituted ought to be committed the sole management of lying that in their outer room there ought always to attend some persons endowed with a great stock of credulity a generation that thrives mightily in this soil and climate he thinks a sufficient number of them may be picked up any where about the exchange these are to circulate what the other coin for no man spreads a lie with so good a grace as he that believes it that the rule of the society be to invent a lie and sometimes two for every day in the choice of which great regard ought to be had to the weather and the season of the year your  or terrifying lies do mighty well in november and december but not so well in may and june unless the easterly winds reign that it ought to be penal for any body to talk of any thing but the lie of the day that the society is to maintain a sufficient number of spies at court and other places to furnish hints and topics for invention and a general correspondence in all the market towns for circulating their lies that if any one of die society were observed to blush or look out of countenance or want a necessary circumstance in telling the lie he ought to be expelled and declared incapable besides the roaring lies there ought to be a private committee for whispers constituted of the ablest men of the society here the author makes a digression in praise of the whigparty for the right understanding and use of prooflyes a prooflye is like a proofcharge for a piece of ordnance to try a standardcredulity of such a nature he takes transubstantiation to be in the church of rome a proofarticle which if any one swallows they are sure he will digest every thing else therefore the whigparty do wisely to try the credulity of the people sometimes by swingers that they may be able to judge to what height they may charge them afterward toward the end of this chapter he warns the heads of parties against believing their own lies which has proved of pernicious consequence of late both a wise party and a wise nation having regulated their affairs upon lies of their own invention the causes of this he supposes to be too great a zeal and intenseness in the practice of this art and a vehement heat in mutual conversation whereby they persuade one another that what they wish and report to be true is really so that all parties have been subject to this misfortune the jacobites have been constantly infested with it but the whigs of late seem even to exceed them in this ill habit and weakness to this chapter the author subjoins a calendar of lies proper for the several months of the year  the ninth chapter treats of the celerity and duration of lies as to the celerity of their motion the author says it is almost incredible he gives several instances of lies that have gone faster than a man can ride post your terrifying lies travel at a prodigious rate above ten miles an hour your whispers move in a narrow vortex but very swiftly the author says it is impossible to explain several phoenomena in relation to the celerity of lies without the supposition of synchronism and combination as to the duration of lies he says they are of all sorts from hours and days to ages that there are some which like your insects die and revive again in a different form that good artists like people who build upon a short lease will calculate the duration of a lie surely to answer their purpose to last just as long and no longer than the turn is served  the tenth chapter treats of the characteristicks of lies how to know when where and by whom invented your dutch english and french ware are amply distinguished from one another an exchangelye from one coined at the other end of the town great judgment is to be shown as to the place where the species is intended to circulate very low and base coin will serve for wapping there are several coffeehouses that have their particular stamps which a judicious practitioner may easily know all your great men have their proper phantateusticks the author says he has attained by study and application to so great skill in this matter that bring him any lie he can tell whose image it bears so truly as the great man himself shall not have the face to deny it the promissory lies of great men are known by shouldering hugging squeezing smiling bowing and lies in matter of fact by immoderate swearing  he spends the whole eleventh chapter on one simple question whether a lie is best contradicted by truth or another lie the author says that considering the large extent of the cylindrical surface of the soul and the great propensity to believe lies in the generality of mankind of late years he thinks the properest contradiction to a lie is another lie for example if it should be reported that the pretender was at london one would not contradict it by saying he never was in england but you must prove by eyewitnesses that he came no farther than greenwich but then went back again thus if it be spread about that a great person were dying of some disease you must not say the truth that they are in health and never had such a disease but that they are slowly recovering of it so there was not long ago a gentleman who affirmed that the treaty with france for bringing in popery and slavery into england was signed the   th of september to which another answered very judiciously not by opposing truth to his lie that there was no such treaty but that to his certain knowledge there were many things in that treaty not yet adjusted  the account of the second volume of this excellent treatise is reserved for another time finis books sold by john morphew near
