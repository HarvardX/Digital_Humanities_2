brangin knights soldiers peasants etc  scene a castle and its vicinity situated in a forest in germany  to the queens most excellent majesty this opera is humbly dedicated by her majestys most faithful and most obedient subject  leo macnally temple nov  0      preface this opera was written upon the spur of the occasion a circumstance which may palliate though not excuse its faults the subject of the fable remains as in the original but a few alterations have been made in its construction and the writer has attempted to heighten the characters by a coloring of humor  few pieces have experienced a more extraordinary persecution previous to its appearance the manager and writer were pestered with anonymous letters threatening its destruction by the force of party for their daring to attempt an emulous opposition to the romance under the same title then preparing at drury lane and after it appeared several of the prints teemed with severe animadversions and abuse  one critic displayed his judgment with great ingenuity and candor he opened his old school satchell and quoted both greek and latin to point out passages analogous to classic ideas every literal error of the press was produced and animadverted on with astonishing ability he found prosaic lines in the poetry and poetic thoughts in the prose but above all he made this great discovery that the sentiments of loyalty breathed through the dialogue were inimical to the british constitution  as men of sensibility feel when their generosity is brought forward this critic shall not be put to the blush but be permitted to indulge in the secret satisfaction arising from his friendly exertions  richard coeur de lion a comic opera the songs marked thus  are translations from the french opera of coeur de lion
