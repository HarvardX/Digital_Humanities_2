northumberland it appears necessary to take notice of the roman possession of this territory and to collect into a separate chronological class the state of regal authority therein under the saxon heptarchy  the kingdom of northumberland as established in the reign of aelle comprehended the two british provinces of bernicia and deira and extended from the rivers mersey and humber on the south to liddisdale cheviot hills and the river tweed on the north and from east to west from the german ocean to the irish channel  the etymologies given by camden of the name of northumberland are from the saxon noranhumbra ric the kingdom of northumberland and noranhumberlond lands north of humber et regiones omnes quae trans humbrum aestuarium ad septentriones jacent saxonico nomine noran humbra ric i e nordanhumbrorum regnum vocari caeperunt  camden brit p   the provincial name of bernicia the same author derives from the british appellation given to the inhabitants of guir brinaich mountaineers inde cum regnum berniciorum quas brittanni guirabrinaich ed est quasi montanos dicunt  camden brit p       the scene of my attention in this work is that part only of this extensive territory which retains the name northumberland bounded toward the east by the german ocean toward the west by the county of cumberland toward the north by the river tweed and the shire of roxborough and toward the south by the county palatine of durham  this district at the time the romans first entered it was inhabited by the otadini toward the east and the gadeni on the western and maintainous parts it is presumed these invaders had not advanced so far northward as northumberland before the third year of agricolas command in britain according to tacituss account he came over in the character of legate in the year    when the summer was far advanced that this dignity was conferred upon him immediately after his consulship which by the fasti consulares appears to have been in the year    so that the reduction of northumberland by the roman ars happened in the year  0 the romans did not totally desert this island till the middle of the fifth century and they possessed several stations is northumberland to the last consequently their continuance there was for a series of near   0 years horsley brit romans lib i cha     agricola it is well known in his recession from the business of warfare studied to introduce the roman habit and luxury among the britons as a good politician conceiving that whilst these pleasures fascinated they also enervated and relaxed rendering the natives less ferocious and easier to be conciliated or subdued and would also promote the future wealth of a province of which he had the honor to complete the conquest by urging the inhabitants to extend their trade pleasures and luxuries introduce artificial wants which arts manufactures commerce and navigation must supply  these new enjoyments were of a short existence for in the course of the fourth century after agricolas command the natives were left exposed to the ravages of barbarous nations no longer kept in awe by the roman arms  the unhappy estate of the northern inhabitants after they were totally deserted by the romans is easily conceived the perils and miseries to which they were frequently exposed by the incursions of tribes of picts and scos naturally induces a belief that the principal part of those who were possessed of riches merchandise flocks and herds would immediately retire and seek for safer and more peaceful habitations in the southern parts of the land the ravagers still advanced and the wretchedness of the britons was so greatly increased that they were driven to seek refuge in the mountains and conceal themselves in their forests and caverns such was the deplorable situation of the natives in the year     when they implored the assistance of the saxons a brave and warlike people inured to arms  our historians with a disgraceful partiality have stigmatized the saxons with the epithets of cruelty and injustice in order to extenuate the errors of the britons or to palliate their despicable impotence  it manifestly appears that under the protection of the romans the britons had sunk into supineness and depravity public virtues were extinguished and an abjectness of spirit universally prevailed they sent ambassadors to the saxons thus commissioned  most noble saxons we the wretched and distressed britons worn our by the constant incursions of our cruel and merciless enemies and because we have heard of the fame of those glorious victories which by your valor you have obtained therefore have we sent our humble suppliants to you to implore your kind assistance we have large and plentiful possessions abounding with every necessary these with ourselves we submit to your disposal if you will generously lend us your succor against our inveterate foes long have we enjoyed the sweets of peace under the powerful protection of the roman arms and now we know none second in glory to them but yourselves therefore to you we lift up our hands for assistance and in return are willing to abide whatever service you shall impose upon us witichindus gest sax lib i  some authors say the saxons were not invited over by the britons but being exiled from their own country landed here but mannius in particular does not show any proof for this assertion from the situation of the german states in that era  verstigan from the authority of pomarius says  000 saxons came over hector boethius says they were  0000 in number and were transported in  0 ships     why should we discredit this historian when the former petitions made to the roman state were equally as abject to aetius thrice consul the groans of the britains the barbarians drive us to the sea the sea forces us back again upon the barbarians in these dreadful extremities death awaits us equally on both sides either we must fall by the hands of our enemies or else be drowned in the swelling waves  the isle of thanet was allotted to these new allies and it was not long before they rendered signal services to the britons the northern ravagers with a mighty band were advanced into lincolnshire the saxons with alacrity took the field historians agree the victory obtained over the invaders near stamford was only to be attributed to the military prowess and skilful dispositions of the saxons  a people recovering from a state of despair are apt to advance to excess in their love and gratitude toward their redeemers after the ravagers were thus discomfited and had retired into the north the saxons were looked upon with the highest veneration and in order effectually to repress the northern nations an additional band of saxons were petitioned for and a greater extent of territory granted for their residence the scotch writers say this reinforcement consisted of  000 men so happy were the britons in their new alliance that vortergern their prince espoused rowena the daughter of hengist the saxon general  the circumstances evidently prove the saxons were invited hither to partake the land and become settlers as it does not appear from any admissible authority that any other gratuity bid and ethelwerd are silent as to any promises of submission made by the natives gildas says their first pretense of quarrelling was for a greater allowance the expression in gildas is epimenia a roman team for the pay of a soldier in bid it is aionae which is construed the produce of lands provisions of corn etc from thence the editor of camden determines they were merely mercenaries was stipulated for their services the saxons were not applied to till the country was almost totally lost or become dsert so that providing them settlements was giving even what the fugitive britons could not hold the county of kent was the second establishment granted to these allies  so peculiarly frail and instable by nature were the dispositions of mind possessed by the natives that no sooner were they relieved from the most abject state and deplorable calamities and distresses than in the moment of ease they began to regard those who had rescued them with jealousy to be discontented with their former resolutions to imagine future evils and to devise projects of the grossest ingratitude the heroic saxons received the intelligence with contempt and looked upon the ingratitude with abhorrence the most abject mind the soonest conceives ingratitude there is a baseness and illiberality in grovelling souls which detests a sense of obligations the meanest peasant has the most ungenerous sentiments distrust and jealousy are the issue of vicious hearts selfishness is brutal and characteristic of ignorance on the other hand heroc minds are fired with virtues for courage and fortitude are the result of principle the angry saxons no sooner beheld the instability of british faith and affection than they began to devise the means of taking the reigns of government out of the hands of impotence the name of king was yet unknown among the saxons who in emergencies of state chose an heretogen or general whoe power and dignity subsided with the occasion of his election they knew no obligation to sovereigns their liberty was uncontaminated with the appendages of supremacy the royal dignity of vortergein was by them esteemed of little importance and of much less utility  the abjectness of the britons was despicable and the saxons contemplated it with contempt the land before their arrival was ravaged by barbarous tribes even the southern provinces were desolated and the natives driven to the forests and mountains they were no longer able to retain or worthy to rule so fertile a country such were the causes which induced the saxons to devise means of ging the government  authors who impeach the saxons of breach of public faith overlook the terms on which they were invited hither and the indignities and injuries they sustained before they turned their arms against the natives had they from the first intended to make themselves masters of the country it was foolishly impol to strengthen the britons by the repulsion of the picts and scots the cmm incidents of war are shocking to humanity and horrid in their detail the  were barbarous and the dispositions of men savage the miserable scenes in the reprocation of such warfare looks terrible indeed in the narrative of the historian but men were not more peculiarly brutal and inhuman in these conflicts than in other countries in the same era or among equally barbarous  in later centuries authors in the warmth of accusation neglect the consideration of the advantages we finally derived from the saxons no less than the maxims of our common law and the original principles of our inestimable constitution if we inherit any thing from the britons it consists of their ferocity instability and ingratitude without the saxon arms this island like the regions of the east would have been overrun and desolated by a banditti worse than tartars and become a den of thieves pirates and robbers  the british prince still lived in a state of confidence and esteem with his new ally every one but vortergern could discern the countenance of amity which hengist now assumed was a superficial mask which covered his resentment through which insincerity was easily discovered and that protection was at length become his most distant object the britons conceived that from the time of rowenas espousal the saxons put on an insolent and contemptuous carriage which increased their natural jealousy against them  on the other hand the saxons observed the government was involved in anarchy and confusion the british states were distracted by factions and cabals and each individual overwhelmed in despondency and relaxed from all warlike disposition hengist foresaw that if he should withdraw his troops this fine fertile land must become a desert under the ravages of those barbarians who were irresistible by british force the depopulation of the northern territories favored an intention he had formed as he conceived the possession of northumberland would facilitate his subjugation of the britons in order to effect this purpose as he possessed the ear of the prince he expatiated on the ravages constantly made by the northern nations who though lately repressed were again advancing to the interior parts of the country he proposed that a reinforcement of his countrymen should be invited to settle in those desolated districts at once to subdue the ferocious bands of robbers and form a safeguard for the southern provinces the plausibility of the project the imbecility of vortergerns political judgment the abjectness of spirit which possessed the british councils and the wretchedness of the people groaning under distress and the miseries consequent to war together with the implicit confidence with which the prince listened to the admonitions of his confident promising a safe and indolent reign under such protection all concurred to promote the plan  octa the brother of hengist and ebussa his son after receiving the summons with the utmost alacrity prepared to collect their adherents and soon passed over from germany with a chosen band of warlike saxons taking possession of northumberland in the year of our lord      the new colony had not settled long in this district before hengist no longer able to endure the indignities put upon him and his people and the infringements repeatedly made on the lands granted them on their arrival in britain brought his troops into the field and began hostilities  be very in the people is seldom observed under an impotent commander  courage is intimately connected with confidence and where the leader does not possess the good opinion of his troops they act with timidity and reluctance it was the case with the britons when hengist showed his hostile intentions and threw off disguise the subjects of vortergern regarded him with shame their councils were full of confusion and they were seized with a panic almost bordering upon despair the resistance they made was weak and fruitless and at length they fled before the saxon veterans to their former places of concealment in the wildernesses and mountains  the northern band regarding hengisss proceedings as a signal for them to take the field immediately rose in arms  i should advance into too large a field should i follow the saxon arms through all the conflicts i am confined to their northern colony and restrained within the limits of northumberland must forsake a general for a partial view of their actions  some modern authors have accused the northumbrian saxons of a confederacy with the picts and scots a charge i do not find supported by any valuable authority the struggles during the course of fifty years and upwards were many and various the events the britons remained unsubdued and the saxons unexpelled at length in the year     ida with twelve sons and a large reinforcement landed at flamborough chron sax  ethelward malms etc where they were received by their countrymen with acclamations of joy in a short time they drove the britons totally from the province of bernicia inde cum regnum berniciorum constutum esset quod a tesi ad scoticum fretum pertigit pars ejus optima fuit paruitque

authority of the scala chronica scha caron lib   it appears that after hengist had settled in kent octa and his successors assumed the title of dukes until the northumbrian saxons following the example of those of kent elected a sovereign who yet remained subject to the supreme authority of the kentish king they are named in the following order hiring that begat wodnam that begat witeglas of whom came hrs the king that begat uppa that begat heppa that begat hermeger that begat bernack all which were before the noble king ida and the gestes of them before ida be little known by chroniques  the above account stands alone and unsupported our best authorities all concurring that ida was the first who assumed the name of king over the northrumbrian colony  the success and safety of the colony being chiefly derived from ida no doubt influenced the people to give him the name of king and from the power of the hererogen to advance him to that of sovereignty what induced the saxons to forsake their old constitutional maxims and give ida this new authority ancient authors by their silence leave us only conjectures it is probable they were desirous of imitating the british customs in order to conciliate the natives to their government  ida having ascended the throne of bernicia made beddanborough now called bambrough the place of his residence by some he is supposed to be the original founder of the castle by others that he repaired and enlarged the outworks and having removed the palisadoes enclosed the whole with a wall chron sax ethelwerd malms huntington etc all

of our lord   0 and reigned seven years during which period aelle one of the chieftains who came over with ida by some said to be his nephew conducted the saxons against the province of deira from whence having expelled the britons he assumed the sovereignty thereof and settled there with his adherents  glappa a kinsman of ida succeeded to the scepter of bernicia in the year     he lived to reign only five years and of his actions historians are silent in his advancement to the throne we see an example of the ancient elective power of the saxons who regarded not any pretensions to hereditary right as there were living at that time many of the sons of ida  theodwald brother to glappa ascended the throne in the year     and reigned but one year of his transactions historians are silent he was succeeded by frethulf a second brother to glappa who assumed the scepter in the year     and reigned seven years of the transactions of the northern saxons in this period historians are silent math westminster on his demise theodoric the third son of ida ascended the throne and reigned seven years here we have a second example of the elective power being retained and one more striking than the former as therein was a preference of theodoric to his elder brother ethelric who was then living of the transactions of this reign historians are silent  aelle who had reigned in the province of deira with great reputation for twentyseven years on the death of theodoric was elected to the sovereignty of bernicia the two provinces under him thus becoming united obtained the name of the kingdom of northumberland as by his valor and sage conduct he had secured his territories whilst king of deira so the united provinces under his government enjoyed an uninterrupted peace

after the death of aelle ethelric the second son of ida succeeded to the sovereignty of the united provinces in the year     he had spent the greatest part of his life in retirement and was not called

many of the natives submitted themselves to his government he is said to have extended his conquests further and reaped more laurels than any of his predecessors bid lib i h hunt lib ii   as his fame increased and his dominions were enlarged his neighbors the scots began to look on him with a jealous eye and regard his power as advancing to too great eminence for their security they seized the first plausible pretext for drawing their forces into the field and led on by aegthan their king approached the frontiers and prepared to give the saxons battle ethelfrith with all his powers met them at a place called daegstane where after a bloody conflict victory declared for the saxons the scots sustained so great a loss that they were rendered incapable of renewing the war for a considerable time the joy of victory was greatly damped by the death of the kings brother tedbald a heroic youth who commanded a large body of saxons in the engagement  perceiving the scots for four years after this signal victory showed no hostile intentions in the year  0  he carried his arms against the britons who were again harrassing the borders of his dominions a battle was fought near caerleon where he overthrew his adversaries with a mighty slaughter as the armies prepared to engage the saxon king perceiving a great assembly of religious putting up their fervent prayers for the britons and esteeming them as essential enemies as those who bore arms against him gave orders for their destruction and stained his arms with the infamous slaughter of twelve hundred naked and defenseless men monks of the monastery of bangor fifty only of the whole religious assembly surviving who saved themselves by flight bid chron sax   his important conquests made him so much the terror of the adjoining states that he remained for some time undisturbed during the interval of peace he regarded with a jealous eye the growing virtues of edwine the brother of his queen and observed his increasing popularity with so much anxiety that at length he meditated his death presuming that was the only means to secure the province of deira to his crown as edwine had a natural claim thereto the young prince either from a change in the kings conduct toward him or by some intimations of the danger he was in thought it expedient to fly from the dominions of ethelfrith and seek refuge in the court of redwald king of the east angles  ethelfrith disappointed in his project burnt with resentment against redwald and immediately sent messengers to demand the fugitive to be delivered up as a traitor or on refusal to denounce war against the state redwald considering the power of the northumbrian king would have resigned the prince but through the entreaties of his queen who represented in the most forcible language the disgrace such an action would bring upon him and prevailed with him not only to continue the protection he had heretofore granted but also to levy an army and instantly march against northumberland to reprehend the imperious prince for his insolence  these measures were pursued with such expedition that redwald with his army was on the frontiers before the northumbrian monarch received the returning ambassadors alarmed at the sudden danger he raised such forces as the emergency allowed means to collect and hastily advanced to stop the rapid progress of his enemies the armies joined battle on the banks of the river idle near to nottingham where ethelfrith was slain and his forces were routed this victory though eminently fortunate for edwine as it opened his accession to the throne was unhappy to redwald whose glory was purchased by the death of his son regenhere  the sons of ethelfrith hearing of this great overthrow and the death of their father fled the kingdom in terror of the wrath of edwine leaving him no competitor for the crown  ethelfrith reigned twentyfour years he left issue by his queen seven sons eanfred oswald oswine oslac oswid ossa and offa also two daughters oswitha and ebba who were canonized ma wm by a concubine he had one son named oswe speed   edwine supported by the arms of redwald entered the capital of northumberland and in the year     assumed the diadem having just attained his age of twentythree years he possessed a noble and intrepid spirit and conducted his military operations with that skill and fortitude that in a short time he not only relieved the frontiers of his kingdom from the intrusions of the adjoining nations but extended his dominions by conquest even as far as the orchades and mevaman islands now called the hebrides bedes eccles hist lib ii malms lib i   his wife cwenburga the daughter of ceorl king of mercia did not live to see him mount the throne he had not been settled thereon above eight years when he thought of a second espousal the eminent virtues and beauty of ethelburga daughter of the king of kent had reached his ear and he sent embassador to require her in marriage she had embraced the christian faith but he still retained his national principles so that conditions were stipulated for the free exercise of her religion and that she should retain the necessary ministers to officiate therein these preliminaries being settled the marriage was celebrated  the year      at this time cwichelm in conjunction with his father cynegils ruled over the kingdom of wessex a prince of a dark and jealous mind who had regarded the growing power and exalted glory of edwine with envy and conceiving his intrepid spirit might induce him to disturb the lesser kingdoms of the heptarchy of which wessex was then one of the weakest he determined to take edwine off by treachery and by assassination to remove the object of his terror and envy for this purpose he employed one eumer of whom historians have retained nothing previous to this plot edwines court being then held on the banks of derwent the assassin approached him in the character of an ambassador and being admitted to audience as he was delivering a feigned address the specious purport of which claimed the kings particular attention the villain suddenly drew a poisoned dagger from under his cloak and attempted to plunge it in edwines bosom but lilla a faithful servant of the king seeing his danger instantly rushed forward and in his loyal breast received the fatal blow designed upon his sovereign with such resolution the pass was made that the poinard pierced through the body of lilla and wounded the king the desperate assassin surrounded by the kings guards was cut to pieces but not before he had slain another of the attendants in his resolute defense bid   the wound the king received was of little consequence in the end though at the instant from the poison of the weapon alarming this was a proper occasion for paulinus who was one of the queens ministers to exhort the king to renounce the errors of his religion the pious example and love of ethelburga contributed to move his mind and render him more susceptible of the arguments which were used for his conversion at length with the solemnity of a vow he declared that if the deity which the christians served and whom they called the god of justice would enable him to punish this violator of the laws of nature nations and kings who had sent forth unprovoked the murderer against him he would from thenceforth confess his divinity and worship none other gods but him as a pledge of his vow he delivered into the hands of paulinus his infant daughter eanfled who was brought into the world the evening of the day on which the horrid attempt was made against his life to be baptized bid lib i  she was the first christian baptized in northumberland   as soon as his health permitted he arrayed his troops and went forth against the west saxons whom he overthrew in his first battle and put to the sword all those who had devised his death by eumer the assassin  historians do not mention whether he made any political advantages to his kingdom by this war or sat down satisfied with the issue of his revenge  in the succeeding year a d     with great solemnity and pomp during the festival of easter he embraced the christian faith and was baptized by the hands of paulinus multitudes of his subjects following his pious example bid chron sax   such was the excellence of his government that acts of injustice were seldom heard of among his subjects national enemies forbore to provoke his arms and an uninterrupted peace blessed his people for several years during this interval the internal policy was his chief object the roads were rendered safe and commodious and even so minutely that every spring by the way side was preserved and provided with a dish for the refreshment of travelers he

episcopacy of lindifarn as is treated of at large in the course of the following work  the glory of his arms was not more eminent than the fame of his wisdom his lenity and benevolence were in that age proverbial the neighboring nations regarded him with reverence and his people obeyed him with love  these excellencies together with the fate of cedwell irritated the wicked heart of penda the mercian and he levied an army to make war upon northumberland oswald being informed of these military preparations with alacrity collected his troops and met his adversary at maserfield in shropshire on the  th day of august     where after a long and bloody conflict victory declared for penda oswald being among the slain the inhuman conqueror caused the limbs of the deceased king after being horridly mangled to be suspended on a pole like a common traitor or infamous malefactor which caused the name of maserfield to be changed to that of oswalds tree after the departure of penda the

occasions to disturb oswin and at length an open rupture took place both kings took the field but osweos military disposition and passion for arms had occasioned him to train and discipline his troops even in times of peace whilst oswin supinely negligent of all such measures only cultivated those arts among his people which flourished under the auspices of peace osweos army was abundantly more numerous and better arrayed than the forces of oswin when this was made known to him willing to spare the effusion of blood he declined coming to an engagement and when his people urged him to try the event of battle he retired from the army and concealed himself in the house of one humwald his friend where he conceived he might abide in safety and clude the search of his subjects  the army of deira forsaken of their leader disbanded themselves and retired leaving the country open to be possessed by osweo humwald with whom oswin was in concealment in hope of reward from osweo betrayed his trust and delivered up the fugitive king who was immediately put to death this tragical event happened on the  d day of september a d     in the ninth year of oswins reign  when osweo had thus removed the obstacle which prevented his uniting the two provinces he took possession of deira but his government had not been established above two years before ethelwald the son of oswald appeared having

opportunity of shaking off the detestable yoke osweo had subjected them to as they regarded the man with inveteracy who had polluted his hands in the innocent blood of oswin whose memory they revered osweo with all his power was not able to dispossess him though repeated struggles were made which constantly concluded in ethelwalds favor  but these matters were scarce ended or osweo had reconciled himself to sit down contented with the loss of the province of deira before penda renewed hostilities against the northrumbrians in bernicia and osweo by the invaders success was soon reduced to extremities the offers of peace which he made were rejected for nothing but destruction and extent of empire could satisfy the mercian ethelwald also brought his forces into the field professing himself pendas ally the desperate circumstances which attended osweo urged him in the moments of despair to try the event of battle for in submission he saw certain destruction awaited him he

earl of northumberland by william the conqueror expelled osculph who soon after flew him osculph did not long survive this revenge he being killed by a javelin from the hands of a robber after this gospatrick purchased this earldom of the conqueror but was soon after deposed waldeof the son of siward succeeded him and he in a short time lost his head then walcher bishop of durham had the earldom and was slain at a riotous assembly of the people robert mowbray attained these honors which he forfeited by treasonable attempts to depose king william rufus in favor of stephen earl of albemarle king stephen gave this earldom to henry son of david the scotch king and william his son afterward king of scotland assumed the title claiming it from his mother of the family of earls warren as appears by the book of brinkburn abbey after some time elapsed richard the first sold this earldom to hugh pudsey bishop of durham for life ceriding him in his title as having transmigrated an old bishop into a young earl but when the king was a prisoner to the emperor in his return from the holy land hugh having contributed for his ransom only  000 pounds of silver which the king resenting esteeming it but a trifling sum for one who had amassed immense riches he divested him of this dignity after which time the title of earldom of northumberland lay dormant about   0 years at length it was revived in the family of piercys  camden brit   in this county innumerable monuments of antiquity and natural beauties exist to excite a travellers curiosity the possession of the romans and in after times the conflicts with the saxons danes and scots render it truly historical ground  many of the present inhabitants are derived from a race of heroes who purchased immortal honors in the annals of their country  on this tour i visited aldston in the county of cumberland to have access to northumberland at the southwest point  aldston is a small market town meanly built hanging on the declivity of a steep hill inhabited by miners the fatigue of passing bad roads in a mountainous barren and inhospitable country was in no wise alleviated by the scene which presented itself here pent in a narrow valley over which mountains frowned with a melancholy sterility and nakedness the wind tempestuous impending clouds stretching forth a dark and disconsolate curtain over the face of morning rain beating vehemently against the windows which were not able to resist the storm a few trees standing near the inn tossed by the heavy blasts which howled down the valley whilst the accommodations within doors were even comfortless rendered such a frontispiece to a pursuit of pleasure as would have given a check to any thing but insatiable curiosity  we were under the influence of the highest lands in this part of the island and could not avail ourselves of the name of summer against such a climate for i presume two fair days together are seldom known in this country  we passed over the south branch of the river tyne by a stone bridge and entered the county of northumberland on the maiden way a roman military road near  whitley which bears at present the name of whitley castle though only the remains of the roman station called in dean gales antoninus alione her p     situate on the brook of gilderdale the southern boundary of this part of northumberland  whitley lays on an irregular descent inclining to the east is an oblong square with obtuse angles   0 paces from east to west and   0 from north to south the ground falls swiftly from the eastern side of this station but to the west the hills over look it from whence it was easily assailed  in order to fortify it on this weak quarter it is slanked on the northwest and southwest angles with several trenches and breastworks of earth and on the west with seven several trenches and breastworks running out to a kind of semicircle the entrance is on the south as a sketch of whitley will give the reader a general idea of those stations i visited in this county i have subjoined an etching it is  mr hrsley should represent this station so all in his plates  it is delineated as being  to the no nded by three trenches and vlums or rampires and on all the  by four with an eance on each side     the maiden way before spoken of extends from a small fort called maiden castle on stainmore by kirby thore in westmoreland and whitley to caer voran in this county guarded by a chain of stations this military road was repaired by part of the twentieth legion as is denoted by a centurial stone discovered thereon inscribed vexillatio legionis vicesimae v v reficit cxi  vexillatio legionis vicesimae valentis victricis refecit  this and the three following belong to the roman station which has been at whitley castle near kirkhaugh in the southwest corner of the county of northumberland it is only the old roman station that goes by the name of the castle this station is upon the military way usually called the maiden way and this inscription is in the custody of mr henry wallace of whitley the proprietor of the ground in which the station has been the stone is manifestly of that sort that are usually inserted in the face of the walls or other works built or rebuilt by the soldiers and nothing more can be inferred from this inscription but that a vexillation of the  0th legion had rebuilt this station or somewhat about it  horsley p   0 the notitia places at alione the third cohort of the nervii in mr horsleys b romana cxii  maximo germanico pontifici maximo tribunitiae

it is a great pity it should be so imperfect and broken since probably it has been much of the same nature with that of which camden has given us the original and which i shall next describe i have set the reading under this inscription which i take to be right i know not whether the character like a greek ph in the third line be only an ornamental stop or designed for pio or that the p has been effaced and this put only for  0 according to the like contraction in the inscription now in the library at edinburgh nor am i able to determine whether the first letters in the  th line can have been p r for proconsul a title that caracalla also assumed or for praefectus the name of the commander having been at the end of the preceding line  horsley p   0 we find two altars inscribed to the emperor caracalla which prove this matter it is contended by some that alione was held up and garrisoned by the romans to the latest date of their abode in this country this was a wretched place for the subsistence of a cohort cultivation even in this age has only crept down the skirts of the valleys and hung upon the margins of the rivers even where her steps have imprinted the narrow shores corn has not hitherto blessed the labor of the husbandman  mr camden says that whitley castle retained the marks of a great and ancient town enclosed toward the north with a fourfold rampire this description convinces me camden never visited the place it is so inconsistent with the true state of it he gives us one of the inscriptions discovered there in the following form being one of those in

possible whatever  now become of it for it is not to be seen at conington there is yet remaining at appeby in westmoreland what i at first supposed had been the original there is at this place another copy or two cut out as this on stone the originals of which i know are at conngton which increases my jealousy about this as does likewise a memorandum at the bottom of the stone on which this inscription is cut namely de astonmore signifying the pace from whence it came which is undoubtedly modern though this might be added when the stone was removed to appleby and so the roman inscription notwithstanding be genne however from this and camdens copy diligently compared i have given such a reading to it as appeared to me the most probable camden tells us that the inscription was imperfect and compendiously written with the letters linked one in another yet he has given it only in plain roman capitals but by the help of the stone at appleby i have brought it nearer to the true form the inscription is manifestly to caracalla and the titles given to his predecessors are agreeable to the roman history all that camden says in relation to it by way of explication is that the third cohort of the nervii built a temple here to antoninus the emperor the son of severus  but in order to make some see of the latter part of the inscription we must consider it more nicely in the ninth line there have been most probably some numeral letters after imp and more after tr pot and these may be determined by consulting history and the inscriptions on coins in order to know how often he enoyed the tribunitial power and been saluted imperator when he was the fourth time consul which was the second year after his fathers death and his leaving britain i find one roman coin which seems to determine the whole in which we have tr p xvi imp ii cos iiii so that the ninth line has probably been the like as above it is true he had often during the same consulate the tribunitial power and was oftener saluted imperator but the vacant spaces seem not to admit any larger numbers the p p at the end of the line is patri patriae in the next line i apprehend there is only an x wanting before voto thus aed ex voto adem ex voto etc pr pr for propraetor seems also to be effaced in the last line but one but i am apt to think there has been nothing more in the last line and that no letters are wanting between the m and g though so represented in camden as if there were and that we are to read genio romae posuit so that if this temple has been erected to caracalla it has been dedicated to him as the genius of rome or of the roman people a flattering compliment too often paid by the roman people to their emperors perhaps the name of the propraetor has been designedly struck out but who he was cannot be known from any other inscriptions and as for the roman historians they are entirely silent with respect to any affairs in britain at this time and for a great while after to remove the difficulty that may seem to arise from caracallas being called the grandson of m aurelius antoninus to whom his father severus was no ways related nor ever adopted by him it may not be amiss to repeat what i observed before from xphiline that after the death of albinus severus called himself the son of marcus and brother of commodus hence his son caracalla is called the grandson of marcus antoninus but there is another difficulty in the words of the inscription and that is how caracalla could be adnepos or atnepos both to trajan and nerva for if he was so to the former as the regular series of the preceding emperors requires he must have been trinepos to nerva perhaps therefore the word et in the sixth line should be fill and we ought to read divi trajani parthici filii divi nervae adnepoti this will make the genealogy consistent and the manner of expression is not improper and in effect the same as trajani adnepoti nervae trinepoti this inscription was erected in the year     when caracalla was the fourth time consul i have described and explained it next to number cxii because i think these two are somewhat of a like nature  horsley p     imp caes lv  big adia  m

there are not the least traces to be found at this day of any such edifice  on the opposite side of the tyne as we passed down the valley we had a view of kirkhaugh when mr horsley visited the place he found in the churchyard a roman altar inscribed deae minervae et hercvli victori cxiv  d minervae et herculi victori  this altar is now in the churchyard of kirkhaugh it is erected to minerva and hercules victor but by whom or on what occasion does not appear the greek writers call those dees who were worshipped together at the same altar  and these two minerva and hercules might perhaps be joined on this altar to intimate that the roman arms were conducted with equal skill and fortitude horsley p       but on enquiry we were informed it was lately removed  we passed down the vale a wild and uncultivated scene till we approached  knaresdale where some narrow enclosures by the brink of the river cheered the eye which for some miles had labored over a sameness of unpleasing objects with languor here the meads and some little woods which hang upon the declivities were contrasted by the brown heath and gray rocks of the mountains and made the landscape picturesque  as i now leave the maiden way or roman military road and found in this uncultivated country the most perfect remains i ever saw to give the reader a general idea it may not be improper to introduce a description of this as it is to be presumed all the roman roads bore a similarity thereto in their construction though not in their breadth the maiden way in the gentlemans magazine of the year      the origin of the name maiden way is learnedly defined by the great antiquary mr pegg under his feigned signiture of p gemsege particularly he says to que a conjecture upon a p so obscure perhaps it may come from the british word a per or beautiful hence possibly may come the anglo saxon word maio and maen virgo which in that case answers exactly to our present expressions a fair one and  a sense undoubtedly very well accommodated to all the three places h to the road and the two fortifications maiden castle maiden way and maiden hold is near six yards wide the sides are formed by lines of very large pebbles from whence in an easy bow the interior pavement rises to a crown where the road lays down steep descents the pavement is formed of flat thin stones placed on their edges and laid transversely it passes many brooks and i examined whether any bridges of mason work had been thrown over them but could find no remains of such which leads me to determine that these places were passed by means of platforms formed of timber or trunks of trees the rocks to which the pavement adjoined would certainly have retained some testimony of mason work if any had been used  knaresdale hall is ruinous and neglected it was the seat of one of the prats in the reign of edward i who forfeited the same after which it was granted to sir robert de swinburn it came to wallace of copeland castle by marriage of eleanor second daughter of john swinburn of edlingham and ralph wallace his descendant sold it to mr alderman stephenson of newcastle upon tyne  we passed by a stone bridge over the river tyne below knaresdale and from the opposite heights had a view of  lambley now consisting of a small chapel with a few scattered cottages here was formerly a house founded for benedictine nuns dedicated to god st mary and st patrick authors differ touching the foundation speed and camden attribute it to the lucys tanner to adam de tynedale and others to king john by deed of confirmation of the second year of king john johannes dei gratia etc dat per manum s wellensis archidiaconi apud hextoldesham xiv die februarii regni nostri anno secundo certain endowments made by adam de tynedale and others of that family were confirmed to this religious house at the suppression it consisted of six nuns and was valued at  l   s  d the site of the convent is not now to be discovered in camdens day it was for the most part undermined by the floodings of the tyne and fallen down john duke of northumberland had lambley by the grant of edward vi it was afterward in the featherstonhaughs of featherston castle and now is the estate of sir lancelot allgood this place suffered in an incursion of the scots in the reign of edward i ad      when passing down redesdale and tindale burning and laying waste the country and committing horrid cruelties on the inhabitants they destroyed corbridge burnt the town monastry and church of hexham and also this small nunnery the wretched nuns suffering the common fate of captives in those savage invasions torture and ravishment  the river being rough and the fords not known to us we left the vale and traversing the heights approached  featherston castle which lays in a little sequestered valley concealed by the surrounding hills from the eminence over which we traveled we could command a view for several miles on every hand but almost the whole scene was one vast expanse of waste and barrenness hill arising beyond hill in dreary succession of broken crags or brown heath at the feet of the mountains here and there a little verdure was perceived a narrow valley and a solitary cottage the inhabitants are shepherds and languish out a life of indigence and laziness as we descended into the vale where the castle stands some pretty plains of meadow ground on the margin of tyne were revealed to us which whilst we remained on the heights lay concealed from our view  the castle is little more than a square tower calculated for defense against those tribes of robbers the moss troopers every chief mansion in the county of northumberland in former times was obliged to be thus defended so that the number of those small castles is very great featherston tower has two exploratory turrets it is vaulted underneath for the purpose of securing flocks and herds in the time of assault  the family of featherstonhaugh possessed this place for several ages the first upon record is thomas de featherstonhaugh in the first year of edward i who held it as a member of the barony of tynedale excheat   edward i after whom it remained in that family till the latter end of the reign of queen elizabeth it afterward was sold to lord carlisle and is now the possession of sir matthew featherstonhaugh mr wallis who wrote the antiquities of northumberland with infinite

the river grassy plains forming the depth of the vale through which the tyne rushes and a few scattered cottages over which solemn and gloomy mountains on every hand impend  we pursued our way to bellister castle by a winding road on the banks of tyne the vale widening as we proceeded and the progress of cultivation increasing upon us  a most happy change to a traveller  the situation of  bellister castle is beautiful a rich vale intervenes between it and the river at the time of our passage covered with an abundant crop of wheat the tyne here a formidable stream shows many broad canals as it winds down the valley the banks are wooded and the rising grounds on every side are rich and well cultivated  the town of haltwezell is a great ornament to the landscape as it is seen hanging on the opposite eminence  this castle is a rude structure of an irregular form as it now lays in ruins placed on an artificial mount defended by a moat the whole a ragged and confused pile of mouldering walls without any ornament or beauty and rendered more gloomy by the branches of large oaks which have surmounted the building and shade great part of its remains  this was the seat of the blenkinsops them  erkinsop ner of estor   king edward vi george   0 queen elizabeth wallis  wallis says a younger branch of the family of blenkinsop castle it is now the property of john blenkinsop coulson esquire of jesmond but the manor appertains to the ellisons of parkhouse  we proceeded toward haltwezell in hopes to pass the river by the ferryboat but the boatman who thinks himself a competent judge of the necessity there is for his attendance was not to be found and we were obliged to pass the ford which is broad and deep with a bottom of very large stones over which a horse breast deep in the water unaccustomed to the passage incessantly faulters or stumbles those circumstances would have been greatly aggravated by our ignorance of the place had we not met with a person to conduct us  instances of well applied charity characterize this age it would not be one of the least to give a stipend to an attendant at such fords as these by which many valuable lives would be saved  is it not shocking that a traveller should be exposed to infinite perils by the stupidity or folly of a boatman who presumes to determine on a matter of such moment as the fate of his fellow creature a wretch whose character perhaps is one of those humiliating subjects which serve to reduce selfestimation and human vanity by showing how near man in the lowest class is to the brute creation  haltwezell is a pleasant village holding a market on thursdays the situation is lofty the churchyard on the south side of the town commands a fine prospect over the vale where tyne flowing in meanders shows itself variously upon the landscape which is bounded by bellister castle and the adjoining woods on the one hand and extends to haydon bridge on the other at the instant of our view varied with all the rich temts of summer and the happy effects of cultivation  the church contains little that is remarkable within the altar rails is the tombstone of an ecclesiastic sculptured with a crosier of excellent work and highly ornamented a pilgrims scrip and staff with a coat armor party per fesse and three garbs the personage interred not known  the following rude epitaph marks one of

the crusade lays here his legs across and hands elevated said to be one of the blenkinsops of blenkinsop castle  the scots plundered this place in the reign of queen elizabeth but being pursued by the then lord warden of the middle marches they suffered severely for their temerity  here is an infant manufactory of coarse baize to which the situation promises prosperity  a small endowment was made by lady capel for a master to teach reading and writing  at the east end of the town is an eminence called castle banks of an oval figure in the center of which is a fine spring on the east and west end four distinct terraces bankings or gradations are cut arising one above another the crown of the hill is defended by a breastwork of earth toward the town and on the south by an inaccessible precipice at whose foot the river runs to what people this fortification belonged is not known no memorable action having made it remarkable in history mr walliss opinion appears to be a very just one that these eminences thus terraced were occupied by the militia when an enemy had penetrated the country where they not only had a powerful appearance in such arrangement but also could fight with great advantage when an attack was made upon them  this county bears innumerable memorials of warfare several of which are not now to be ascribed to any particular people either from their form materials or construction it was the mode of all contending parties in ancient times to entrench and throw up breastworks which were frequently formed to suit the situation without regard to any singular model common to themselves this was the practice only in times of immediate emergency the permanent camps or stations were fortified in a mode peculiar to each people such as are remarkable will be particularly noticed in the following pages  from haltwezell we proceeded to  carrvoran a roman station situate on a declivity which descends swiftly toward the southwest about a hundred yards distant from the picts wall of a square figure with obtuse angles each side being   0 paces the pretorium is very distinguishable about seven paces from the southern side commanding a very extensive prospect mr carrick who farms the ground is raising the foundations of the pretorium and will no doubt discover some valuable antiquities i procured here a fine silver coin of antoninus pius well preserved which was found on this station  in warburtons vallum romanum this station is numbered eleven his treatise beginning at segedunum with mr horsley he presumes there is no doubt but this was the ancient magna where the cohors secunda dalmatarum was quartered according to the notitia whether the ancient name magna was british or purely roman is difficult to determine horsleys br to p  0    mr horsleys description is chiefly that carrvoran is placed about    or    chains to the south of both the walls which are here very near to each other and has a peat moss before it this may both be the reason of the modern name and why the walls approach no nearer to it the ramparts round this fort are very conspicuous and the whole ditch remains distinguishable the buildings without the fort have been on the south and west sides on the descent toward the river tippal this is one of the forts entirely within hadrians vallum the military way called maiden way passes through this place and as is said goes to beau castle which is about six miles from it and the other military way which comes from walwick chesters passes a little to the south of this fort or enters and terminates in the roman town here it is very visible upon the moor southeast of and not far from carrvoran  a small altar was formerly found here dedicated to vitirinaeus a tutelar god camden   deo viti rine   limeo in consequence of a vow  rov  posuit libens merito p l m a small brass image of one of the lares  a ring engraven with the figure of victory on a rough cornelian  a curious effigy in relief of a roman

with a fibula in his right hand he is armed with the hasta and rests his left on a parma or shield supported on a pedestal above his shoulder are the figures of a stag seized by a lion abundance of stags horns have been dug up here the bones and ashes of animals and many millstones mr horsley has the following inscriptions in his brit romans  lxvi solvit libentissime merito  this i found lying in the court before the house it is an altar and has a praesericulum on one side and a patera with a crocked handle on the other but i could discern no letters at all on the face of the altar though the four on the base were visible  lxvii deo vitiri menius dada votum solvit libens merito  abundance of antiquities of various sorts have been dug up in this roman station and town when i was last there i purchased a roman ring with a victory on a cornelian but coarse as also a small altar lately found with the above very plain inscription upon it dedicated by one menius dada to the god vitires  lxviii dis manibus aurelia pubeo voma vixit annos aurelius pubeo naso pientissimae filiae dicat  these stones are used for two steps in the stairs of a house the letters are very visible but part of them especially on one of the stones is covered by the next step above which rests upon this i soon perceived that both of them must have originally belonged to one and the same stone the whole stone appears plainly to have been a funeral monument erected by aurelius pubeo naso for his daughter aurelia pubeo voma neither this nor the preceding stones have been published before unless a small altar in mr warburtons map of northumberland with the same letters sllm on the base of no lxvi though there is little resemblance between the two draughts  lxix dirus vitirious deccius votum solvit libens merito  this is a small altar found here by mr gordon and presented by him to baron clerk in whose collection it now is mr gordon supposes it to be the same with that which was discovered by mr camden dedicated to the tutelar god vitorinus but according to his own representation it must be dirus vitirieus deccius though what this gentleman took for an e is a b in the original so that the name is vitiribus and so it was read to me by the learned baron himself besides it is quite different from that in camden it seems plain from other inscriptions that vitires and not vitirinus was the name of the tutelar god for we meet with vitir in the dative dirus vitiribus deccius is evidently the name of the person who erected this altar it founds more like the name of a foreigner than a roman and therefore this person was probably among the auxiliaries by whom these stations upon the wall were garrisoned  n b on one side of this altar a dolphin is delineated  the learned baron has observes with relation to the dolphin that this was a figure much in use about the time that the roman walls were made in britain and even before the ancients denoted by it dispatch of business and vespasian who was very fond of the proverb used by augustus caesar feina lent ordered on some of his coins a dolphin to be represented twisting about an anchor importing both tarditas and festinatio the dolphin was likewise accounted  by plutarch and others it is probable that some such thing was understood by the erector of this altar there is a boar on the other side of ths altar which is frequently to be met with on ancient sculptures in britain  sh from this station at less than a mile distance stands blenkinsop castle near the side of the river tppal at which place was formerly the following inscription  lxx dehus nymphis vetia mansueta et claudia turbivella filia votum solverunt libentes  the late dr ca of newcastle sent a copy of this inscription to the late mr thoresby of leeds who published it in the transactions it is also in camdens britannia no doubt it had been found some way hereabouts and probably near the river it is now at dryburn haugh near the spittle fixed at the stable door who these nymphs were may be difficult to determine because they were of various sorts and supposed to reside almost in all places both by land and water there is a fine address to the water nymphs in virgil nymphae laurentes nymphae genus amnibus unde est tuque o tybri tuo genitor cum flumine sancto accpite aeneam et tandem arcete periclis   mr warburton has published in his map of northumberland two small altars on the face of one is veteres and on the base of the other dm for dis manibus on the base of an altar these mr warburton says were at thirlwell castle or near it but i could not find the originals  lxxi imperatori caesari flavio valerio constantino pio nobilissimo caesari  this was also found here and carried from hence by mr warburton but has come since into my possession mr warburton takes some notice of it in his map of northumberland the only place i know of wherein it has ever been published before the inscription is cuicus and needs no explanation it has been erected to the honor of constantine the great the letters in the name constantino are crowded for want of room on the stone the repetition of the word caesari at the beginning and end renders it very curious and perhaps singular in its kind spanheim takes notice of the like on two coins one of carinus and the other of numerinus but represents them as peculiar and contrary to the usual custom in the letters imr at the beginning the r which is very plain on the stone is either a mistake for p or else a designed contraction of imper for imperatori so we have nbl for nobilis and cs for caesar as likewise ct for caput or civitas as manutius reads them with several others of the like nature which if attended to may in some cases remove the suspicion of an error in the workmen this monument must have been erected to constantine after the death of his father constantius who died in britain for the title of imperator was not given him till then as to the title nobilis or nobilissimus caesar it was sometimes assumed by the emperors themselves and usually given to their sons  lxxii  du  stireu  betro   at wall end just by thirlwell castle i discovered this inscription it is upon a fragment of a stone and so imperfect that it is very difficult to make any thing of it the stone is coarse but the letters that remain fair and well enough cut by the shape and ornament of the stone i incline to think it has been sepulchral dvi put me in mind of the god dui in a yorkshire inscription if this should be so sepulchral i know not but the last word may have been bretonum that is cohors quarta bretonum and then the word in the second line stireus may be the name of a soldier or commander of this cohort but this is only conjecture  lxxiii jovi optimo maximo  this is now

is just on the other side of the water over against glenwhelt it is centurial too and needs no explicaton  lxxv centuria munatii maximi  under this number are comprehended two of the common centurial inscriptions the former of which was found near walton cast from carrvoran and the latter near foultown about a mile west from it  from the manuscripts of the late r gale esquire extract of a letter from mr john horsley to roger gale esquire   st july      sir since my last to you i have received some inscriptions lately discovered in one or two of the stations on the wall viz great chesters and carrvoran two of them are of the common sepulchral kind the other would i believe have been curious had it not been imperfect the inscription is on the face of an altar under a human figure sacrificing but the arms of the figure are broken off and there remains no more of the inscription than matri which must have been matribus the rest is lost with part of the altar which has been ctred

has consisted of a square tower built on an artificial mount surrounded by an outward wall at the distance only of four paces of equal height with the interior building defended toward the north by a

wallis and held of the manor of langley  a general account of the  picts wall the most remarkable piece of roman antiquity in this country may not be disagreeable in this place before we enter on the more populous parts of the county it was built as a barrier against the incursions of the northern inhabitants who were continually harrassing the romans by attacking them in sundry places at one time or by small bodies of ravagers who swept away the cattle and flocks of the country the romans called it vallum barbaricum pretentatura and clausura hadrians vallum was constructed of earth and bears date about the year     of the christian era severuss is supposed by many to be of masonry and built about the year   0 spartian p     calls severuss work a stone wall but of the materials it was constructed the roman authorities are very vague and doubtful bid says severus having been victorious at home in the civil war which was attended with many dangers was drawn into britain upon an almost general revolt of the allies there where after many conflicts having recovered part of the island he thought it expedient to sever it from the barbarous states not with a wall as some think but with a rampire for a wall is made of stone but a rampire whereby camps are fortified to repel the force of an enemy is made of turfs cut out of the earth and raised in the manner of a wall so that there be a ditch or trench in front whereout the turfs are gotten upon which were pitched piles of very strong timber and so severus cast a great ditch and raised a most strong rampire strengthened with many turrets thereupon from sea to sea here we have a perfect description of one of the roman fortifications which bid by mistake attributes to severus  an outward ditch a rampire of earth fortified with a strong palisado and guarded by turrets from whence with missile weapons the defenders could flank the vallum and command the ditch upon an assault the third and last vallum is by many authors said to be the work of the britons aided by the romans under the third consulate of aetius about the year     who upon receiving a second embassy complaining of the hardships they labored under from the frequent inroads and invasions of the northern nations and their inability to resist them a legion was sent into britain who with the assistance of the natives built or rather rebuilt and reinstated the wall of stone in length    miles from the point of land at boulness on solway firth to the mouth of the tyne gildas says the romans erected a wall after their usual manner of building not like unto the other meaning the vallum of earth or turf or at the common charge of the empire but aided by the poor and miserable natives this was carried from sea to sea between the cities which were placed there as fortifications against the enemy bid adds which wall that was heretofore famous and conspicuous they with public and private cost having with them the helping hand of the britons built eight feet broad and twelve feet high in a direct line from east to west the auth have auted the  to wrong personages it being allowed by the most learned  that the  was the wrk of severus which opinion is sounded on  severus was aded in the work by the bri in  pplies of necessaries for the artificers in the progress of it camden says it had many towers or fortresses each about a mile distant which are called castlesteeds and within little fenced towns in these days called chesters also turrets standing between these from whence the soldiers might discover the approach of an enemy at a considerable distance wherein the areani might have their stations these areani were spies and men swift of foot to give alarms upon approaching danger camden says in his time there was a traditionary tale that a brazen trumpet ran through the wall by which an alarm might be communicated from tower to tower this report he reconciles by an ancient service attendant on the border lands of cornage for which to this day a money payment issues out of many of the northumbrian estates this service of cornage was a kind of tenure in grand serjeantry the nature of which was to alarm the country by the sound of a horn when any invasion of the scots was perceived the wall then was a formidable defense    feet high guarded by castles and exploratory turrets whereas the roman empire by the providence of dioclesian was in the most distant marches securely fortified with towns castles and burghs all the military forces were stationed there so that the barbarous nations could not enter the country without opposition at every pass constantine abolishing this order of garrison removed his troops from the marches to cities and towns not needful of armed force so that he left the marches open to the barbarians ungarrisoned and distressed the cities with the maintenance of troops where there was a settled peace the frontier stations became desolate the soldiers addicted to theatrical entertainments and other pleasures became debauched in a word he it was who brought the first cause of ruin to the empire  zosimus i examined the foundations of some of those castlesteads with attention where the military roads approached the wall and they appeared to me the remains of gateways over which perhaps there were towers for their defense no other apertures are seen in the wall but at the stations which is singular as the romans when they found it necessary to scour the outward frontiers or make a sally on a sudden attack had no sallyports or other means to depart their own fortification than by descending the wall or making an egress at one of these stations or military ways which indeed seems strangely inconsistent it is very probable that the chesters were defended in the same manner as the wall described by bid and perhaps the vallum was surmounted with a palisado of which the corona vallaris i presume is a model not to be denied the obtuse angles of the stations encourage an apprehension that they were guarded by exploratory turrets  the highest part of the wall now standing is near carrvoran where it runs upon the brink of a cliff to the summit of some eminences it is there near nine feet high the outward facing of free stone not totally removed where the foundation was not good or the wall had to pass a morass it is built on piles of oak the interstice between the two facings of the wall is filled with broad thin stones placed obliquely and filled with run lime camden says the wall near carrvoran in his time was    feet high and   feet thick built on both sides of apiece ashler stones which greatly exceeds bedes description at some little distance from walwick the remains of the turf or earth fence are to be seen in three distinct bankings or rampires the principal one about the height of   feet and    feet at the base at the distance of    feet to the south is a trench    feet wide from the southern brink of which arises a rampire of earth about  0 feet at its base and   feet in height    feet distant from this is another rampire of equal height and    feet at its base these two last on the south side of the trench forming a perfect covered way in breadth    feet the most northern of these rampires in this part is distant from the stone wall  0 paces the present military road passing between them  the particular description of these fortifications of the romans given by mr horsley in his brit romans and mr warburton in his vallum romans would be too tedious to be inserted here and inconsistent with my plan their more general observations together with my own must suffice  it is evident there have been three different praetenturae erected here at different times and by different persons the first of which was a series of stations or forts placed quite cross the country and this it is presumed was done chiefly by julius agricola and is the most ancient of the three next to this was erected hadrians vallum and its appurtenances after which the aforesaid stations might probably go by the name of stationes per liniam valli the last and strongest fence of all was as most learned antiquaries agree built by severus which is a stone wall that lays north of the rampires of earth  hadrians vallum was the second praetentatura and seems rather to have given the former the name of stations per liniam valli than the wall of severus what bid says of the walls being rebuilt afterward by the romans is applicable to this that it is carried on from town to town much in a strait line what belongs to this work is the vallum on the brink of the ditch having the ditch on the north another vallum southward distant from the former about    feet and a large vallum on the north of the ditch the south vallum has either been made for an inner defense in case the enemy might beat them from any part of the principal vallum or to protect the soldiers against a sudden attack from the provincial britons these four works keep all the way a constant regular parallelism one to another the third praetentatura was severuss stone wall we have the express testimony of some ancient writers concerning this emperors building a wall cross our island which will be explained hereafter to this work belongs a paved military way which has attended the wall on the south side though it be not always parallel to it it sometimes coincides with hadrians north vallum but whenever this is too distant or perhaps has been too ruinous or in any other respect inconvenient the new military way which is a reparation of the old roman road made by order of government always accompanies severuss wall and comes up near to every castellum upon it and therefore it is to be presumed the roman military road has been a work cotemporary with the wall and directly for its service it is apprehended there has been also a lesser military way near to the wall for the convenience of small parties passing from turret to turret there is also belonging to this work a large ditch on the north side of the wall but there are no remains to prove that there was any breastwork or agger of earth on its northern brink upon this wall certain castles and turrets have been regularly placed and at proper distances one from another and in order to form a general idea of the wall and its original state it will be necessary to have some knowledge of these  all these castles except one near harlow hill which may have been built before the wall are    feet square the wall itself falling in with and forming the north side of them the intervals between these castles are not always exactly the same but excepting two or three at the east end of the wall always less than a mile that is from six furlongs and a half to seven they are constantly called castles or castlesteads by the country people which seems to make it probable that the latin word has been castellum and by the form and use of them seem to have been a smaller sort of a castle for a small garrison so likewise they call the castra stativa or aestiva usually chesters from the latin and this is a usual criterion whereby to discover a roman encampment or station these castella seem to have stood closest where the stations are widest and are by some modern authors called mile castles or milliary castella in the last edition of camden they are through mistake said to be of a very different shape and size perhaps the remaining ruins of two or three castlesteads that do not join the walls and of one that does which are all plainly of another sort have occasioned this error it is not improbable that there may also have been some exploratory castles belonging to hadrians work though there be little appearance of such at present unless the small remains at chapel houses near newburn and those near heddon on the wall which are castlesteads be of this sort but be that as it will in relation to hadrians vallum above twothirds of these castella are yet very visible upon the wall of severus and for a long way together especially about the middle of the wall they have their distinct vestiges remaining without interruption but the original number and situation of these castella may be best known by the following table taken from mr warburtons vall romans and mr horsleys brit romans  castles coinciding with the stations castles whose

hard to find three of them any where together with certainty the distance between two where it was thought surest was measured and found to be near    chains or  0  yards it therefore seems most probable that there have been four of these between every two castella at equal distances from the castella and one another for thus five intervals will be found between every two castella each consisting of    chains which five intervals will just amount to   furlongs the usual or mean distance between the castella and this scheme answers with a good deal of exactness to the situation of all the turrets that have yet been discovered these exploratory turrets or watch towers seem to have been only about four yards square at the bottom and by placing sentinels at each of these who must have been within call of one another the communication quite along the wall might be kept up without having recourse to the fiction of a sounding trumpet or pipes laid under ground from one end of the wall to the other though this seems to be credited by mr echard and others  there have also been several larger forts or stations upon the wall or near it whose distances from each other will be particularly shown hereafter and may be seen in the foregoing table  whilst i am giving a general view of the ancient state of the wall it may not be improper to observe that there have been    of these stations upon it with    intervals between them the wall is in length    miles and three furlongs this divided by    gives the mean distance which is very little more than four miles but the stations are much closer and thicker at each end and in the middle than in the intermediate spaces between the middle and the extremities which is not disagreeable to reason or the usual rules of fortification besides if according to the common tradition the inroads of the enemy were in or near the middle it was necessary to make it stronger and guard it more especially since the advanced stations were fewest if any where those upon the wall were closest  this wall runs generally upon the top or ridge of the higher ground keeping a descent on the north or enemys side and has thereby both a greater strength and better prospect for the sake of which it often forms an angle in hadrians vallum it is different but both in the main seem to have been carried on pretty much in a straight line from station to station there is indeed now and then a gentle turn in crossing a rivulet or at a station and sometimes too in passing a height but this last happens usually at coming within sight of a station and perhaps in order to reach it hadrians vallum keeps more in a straight line than severuss wall as much as the nature of the ground and other circumstances would admit it is plain a military way has constantly attended severuss wall and no doubt was made at the same time with it this always keeps nigh to the wall and never coincides with the north vallum of hadrian but when the two works approach one another when they part and go at a distance one from the other the way leaves the vallum to accompany the stone wall but where the wall passes along the brink of precipices the way does not follow every little turn but in these lesser windings is like the string of a bow and keeps upon the sides of the hill in order to avoid as much as possible the sudden ascent or descent in passing from hill to hill and yet so as at the same time never to be at a great distance from the wall the rule therefore by which this way seems to have been conducted is in general by keeping pretty close to the wall and and at the same time going on a line from castellum to castellum and shunning the ascent of hills as much as possible and as the smaller military way went from turret to turret close by the wall so this greater way attended the castella falling in with hadrians north vallum which mr warburton conceives was the old military way though north of the ditch vallums and covered way when that did not take too much out of the road or was not too ruinous to be made use of the old military way as mr warburton calls it has been the best and most direct passage from station to station and when the line of the stations fetched a compass another distinct military way and shorter was laid not from one station to the next but between two stations more remote  this was certainly done in northumberland from walwick to carrvoran and i have reason to apprehend the like was done also in cumberland from carrvoran or at least from cambeck to stanwicks the military way of severus seems to have been well paved but not raised so high as what mr warburton calls the old military way  mr warburton says he was not able to discover any gates in this wall or passes through it except just in the stations or where the grand military roads have crossed it where the erminstreet not the watlingstreet as mr horsley calls it passes the wall near halton there is a visible track of a square gate and the ditch belonging to the wall manifestly goes about the half of it the inner half not being now so visible this gate seems to be much of the same size with one of the castella    feet square only these are wholly within the wall and the gate half within and half without mr warburton says he expected to have found some other gates of the same form or some passes through the wall in the castella but could not the other two military ways which cross the wall seem to have passed at the stations of carrvoran and stanwicks  what the several dimensions of the walls ditches vallums and military ways have originally been may not be easy to determine with exactness but the length of severuss wall is certainly known it having been three times measured of late once by mr gordon a second time by order of mr warburton and a third by the board of ordnance a d    0 and as there is little difference between the three measures it is a proof there is no material mistake in either mr gordon gives a summary account of his work in these words the number of stations taken in my actual survey from sea to sea were in all     wherein i made severuss wall the principal line of the said stationary distances the total amount of which was       roman paces equal to    roman miles and     roman paces equal to    english miles and     paces  the number of stations or places of observation upon the same principal stationary line in the survey mr warburton ordered to be made were     the length of the wall    miles and   furlongs including the length of the stations at each end in this account english measured miles and furlongs are retained in order to make it more plain and intelligible it is easy to reduce an english mile to a roman one by considering that  000 roman paces that is  000 roman feet make a roman mile and allowing for the inequality between the roman foot and the english an english mile is nearly equal to a roman mile and onethirtieth so that    english miles will be much about    roman  from what has been said it appears to be a mistake to suppose hadrians vallum longer than severuss wall as mr gordon seems to have done it is certain the former has gone more in a right line than the latter and it seems probable that severuss wall has at each end been carried further than hadrians so that the very exact agreement which mr gordon supposes between the actual survey of the wall and the account given of it by the romans themselves is in a great measure imaginary for according to spartian hadrians vallum was  0 roman miles long but the actual mensuration cannot stretch severuss wall up to    and hadrians vallum is certainly two or three miles shorter upon account of its being straighter there had just been    milliary castella upon severuss wall and consequently just  0 intervals between the castella so that if the romans in a general way called every interval a mile one with another and hadrians vallum was near the same length with severuss this might be looked upon as a plausible reason why the historian should say it was  0 miles long  according to bid the wall was eight feet in breadth and twelve feet in height as probably there was a parapet or palisado at the top so this would first go to ruin bedes measure is most likely to be exclusive of these the thickness of severuss wall has been measured several times of late and by several persons without any great variation and by the measures taken in different parts it seems not to have been every where equal near harlowhill it measured seven feet four inches near the foundation and at another place where the wall is two yards high it was at that height about seven feet thick which shows that the usual breadth near the foundation was a roman pace and an half near boulness on the solway firth at a place called kirklands it measures near nine feet and there seems to be an obvious reason why it should be stronger here for at full sea the water has certainly flowed up to it  the breadth of hadrians ditch at a limestone quarry west of harlowhill where the original breadth and depth is apparent and may be exactly ascertained it measured near nine feet deep and eleven feet over it was wider at the top than at the bottom the sides being sloping the ditch belonging to severuss wall was in all places both wider and deeper than that which belonged to hadrians vallum  the distances between the several parts of these works seem some of them to have all the way been constantly the same others of them vary among these variable distances is that between the two walls which sometimes come very near within a chain of each other but at other times are at  0 chains distance the distance also between severuss wall and the military way belonging to it is as i have said not always the same though generally about two or three chains upon some particular occasions it may run at the distance of five or six chains from it or considerably more as between the two castella west of shown sheels where the distance of the military way from the wall is at one part    chains or more but the distance between hadrians vallum ditch and north mound are every where the same and so are constantly parallel one to the other the north mound is about    feet on a medium from the ditch and of the two mounds of the vallum one arises on the very brink of the ditch and the other is about the distance of    feet the materials of which these fortifications were constructed are certainly known hadrians is of earth though sometimes mixed with stone but i could discover no appearance of timber severuss was of free stone as is certain from what is yet visible of it in some places where the foundation was not good they seem to have made use of oaken piles the inner part of this wall is filled after a remarkable manner the filling stones are generally pretty large and mostly broad and thin these are always set edgeways and usually not erect but obliquely upon these the running mortar or cement has been poured and by this contrivance together with the great strength of their cement in most places the whole has been bound as firm as a rock people are much at a loss to know from whence the romans had the stones which they used in building the wall in several parts and for other occasions in some places particularly in cumberland no free stone is to be had but from a very great distance and in other places where some might have been had the romans seem not to have used it but stone of a very different grit this appears more particularly in the station at the end of the wall near cousins house where the roman stone is of a very coarse grit so as to be easily distinguished from others and both the learned authors before me say they were assured that there was no such stone nor any quarry of such a grit in the neighborhood the devils arrows at boroughbridge in yorkshire are yet of a coarser nature and seem to be artificial stone the composition of the devils arrows prove them to be artificial pieces of brick being intermixed with the small pebbles and granules of spar they appear to have been formed in a mould the tops of the columns being channelled as the flowing in of the liquidated composition might be conceived to occasion some particular places from whence they were furnished with stone may be guessed at with probability such for instance are the rocks between walwick and carraw through part of which hadrians ditch was cut and in the late edition of camden it is supposed that stones were got at hellbeck scar on the gelt and leugh cragg the truth of which mr horsley proves in his remarks on the inscriptions there  some have wondered how this work could be carried on in the face of the enemy supposing the wall to be the very boundary at the time it was built but there appears no reason to entertain this opinion for when the romans had advanced their conquests in scotland beyond the firth of tay they only fortified the other isthmus between forth and clyde which might be  0 miles or more south from the utmost extent of their conquest as appears from tacituss account of that matter so that they kept their pretenturae or series of fortifications cross the country a good way within the bounds of their conquest and probably when the walls were erected here the romans were possessed of part of the country beyond them and of son advanced stations there as may be concluded from the inscriptions yet extant so that this wall might probably not be built till severus had driven the enemy so far to the north as to render them incapable of giving any interruption to the romans when carrying on the work  at which end they began the several pretenturae may be another enquiry the pretentura of stations was most probably begun from the west because julius agricola first conquered the western parts of the northern country and hadrian i believe in erecting his vallum began there too as seems probable from the inscriptions severus it is likely did so too with his wall which is much confirmed by the situation of the castella that are at a regular distance if we begin our reckoning from the west but if we begin to reckon from the east end of the wall the first castellum appears within less than three furlongs of the station there  it is the opinion of some ingenious persons that both the walls with all their appurtenances and the stations upon them were the work of the same time and the same person and that the one is only an interior vallum or fosse to the other but that this was not the original design of the vallum though it might be so used by severus appears plain from the testimonies of the roman historians nor does this notion suit the circumstances of the work itself as they yet appear the coincidence of severuss military way with the north vallum without the ditch the exact parallelism of all the parts of hadrians work and the very unequal distances that are between the two walls themselves are convincing arguments that the walls have been erected at different times it is also the opinion of some to whose judgment i pay a great regard that severuss wall was built upon the same foundation with hadrians principal vallum this conjecture is supported by plausible reasons for if the north eminence or line has been an old military way the supposition of a rampart and ditch to the north of that way would remove the difficulty of the soldiers being exposed to the enemy whilst they were on their march since then the way would have been defended on both sides again the stations too as well as this supposed military way are generally though not always included between the two walls and ditches or between the works of severus and hadrian as they are now called the stone wall of severus frequently falling in within the north rampart of the station as the turf wall of hadrian does with the southern  besides this the advantageous ground is often left on the north side of hadrians vallum which in one place near halton chesters is just carried round the south skirt of a tumulus or small hill making a sudden turn seemingly with a design to avoid passing over it now if this was intended to be the most northerly fortification and to be a fence against the northern enemies this conduct seems to offend against right reason as well as against the rule of vigetius that care should be taken to have no neighboring hill higher than the fortification which being seized by the enemy might be of ill consequence and it must be owned that the southern prospect of hadrians work and the defense on that side is generally better than on the north whereas the northern prospect and defense have been principally or solely taken care of in the wall of severus such considerations as these have induced some to believe that what now goes by the name of hadrians work was originally designed for a fence against any sudden insurrection of the provincial britons and particularly of the brigantes whilst others look upon it as a fossa interior for the soldiers to retreat to after they had been beaten off by the northern enemy from their principal vallum both agree in this that hadrian must have built a more northerly vallum than those which now bear his name and that this must have stood upon the same track where severus afterward erected his wall this according to their opinion would render the whole fortification rational and regular whereas without this it must have been in many places very weak and open to the inroads of the caledonians but on the other hand plausible conjectures and speculative arguments must give way to stronger proofs on the contrary side though at this distance of time we cannot see into the designs of the romans nor account for every particular part of their conduct in this affair mr horsley conceives that what is now called hadrians north agger or vallum was the most ancient military way leading from station to station and that hadrians work after this was guided and limited by it as it keeps a constant parallelism to it the north agger considered as a military way is conducted according to the roman art and rules in every part of it it is carried on in the shortest line from station to station and this without doubt is the true reason why it runs so much upon the southern skirts of the northern hills the shortest line leading that way this is particularly remarkable in the small hill near halton chesters before observed the direct line of the way would have lead over the hill but to avoid climbing it a small turn is made to carry it round the skirt and it passes on the south side rather than the north because this is the shorter and more convenient way to the station to which it is tending the other parts of hadrians work keep their due distance and parallelism bending exactly in the same manner as the north agger or vallum does and so running at a few yards distance to the south of the hill in a word the north vallum or as mr horsley terms it the old military way keeps just such a course and runs through such grounds as one would expect such a roman way should do and if it was determined that hadrians work should strictly accompany this and keep all along an exact parallelism to it they must then by this rule be tied down to these seeming irregularities and misconduct which appear in this work it may be said that they might at least have made the fortification on the north side of the military way if there was no other more northerly fence but to this it is replied that it was scarce practicable to carry on the work on the north side of the way so as to be near and parallel to it and such is the situation of the ground that if they had done so it would have been generally weaker than it is running along the very sides of the hills unless they had made it where severuss wall stands and where as has been said some suppose hadrians principal vallum to have stood but that in fact hadrian had no vallum here and that the whole of his work was comprehended in what still goes by his name appears most probable from the following considerations  among all the historians that mention the building of such a wall by severus there is not the least hint to be met with of his building it upon the same foundation with hadrians vallum the expression of spartian apud vallum looks the likest it of any but it is certainly more agreeable to this expression to suppose it to be only near the vallum and not directly upon it and to build a stone wall upon the foundation of an earth one does not appear very probable if i am not greatly mistaken it would be more laborious and expensive to build such a wall upon the ruinous vallum than to erect it upon ground that was entirely clear and there is not at present the least evidence of such a vallum yet it seems hard to suppose that the mound of earth has been every where so entirely removed as to leave no visible remains of it any where along the whole tract of the wall again severuss wall passes over large spaces where the erecting of an earthen rampart seems almost impracticable in some places it passes for a considerable way along the tops of precipices and sometimes down the steep declivities of a bare rock and in these places there is no ditch in one place too the wall is carried through a small morass near bleatarn in cumberland here it is presumed the foundation is formed by piles of wood but hadrians work shuns it and runs at ten chains distance from the wall of severus no circumstances appear in the two works of severuss wall and hadrians vallum that argue them to be done at the same time or to have any necessary relation one to the other the constant parallelism of the north vallum the ditch and the two southern vallums of hadrians work is a shrewd argument of their mutual relation but this parallelism does not hold in the wall of severus where they are most distant there are no visible branches of any military way leading from one to the other whereby the communication between them might be more easily preserved in some places there is a morass between the two walls which must make a retreat from one wall to the other inconvenient and is improper for a body of men to stand on the military way that now attends severuss wall is agreed to have been made at the same time with the wall itself if then hadrians principal vallum was on the same ground where the wall of severus has stood how comes it to pass that there has been no military way accompanying it if hadrians work is supposed to have been designed for a defense against an attack from the south difficulties of the same kind will arise perhaps not easy to be removed for sometimes the advantageous ground is left on the south where it might easily have been otherwise ordered if their design had been only to secure themselves against assailants from the south and the course of their fortification had not been previously determined by some other rule in one place the vallum runs between higher ground on each side besides if it was designed against an enemy from the south the ditch is on the wrong side being to the north of two ramparts and why may we not suppose the most southerly rampart to have been either a slight fence against an attack from the south or an interior defense to retreat to if the ditch should be carried by an assault from the north there was no occasion to draw such a line of defense in order to prevent their making an attack upon the stations for they are stronger on all sides than this vallum it is to be observed that at each end of the wall severuss work is continued beyond hadrians this part then of severuss wall at least was not erected upon hadrians vallum and yet mr horsley says he see no difference between the appearance of this work here and in the other parts of it  the legionary soldiers were the persons employed in building this wall as they were generally in all considerable works of this nature and that the three legions which were at that time in britain built antoninuss wall in scotland is clear from a great number of inscriptions found in that wall which expressly declare it the  0th legion had no concern in building the wall of severus it was wholly done by the other two namely the legio secunda augusta and legio sexta victrix for these legions only as far as appears erected the inscriptions which will be given in the course of this work if therefore  0 cohorts the number in two legions built the whole wall it will be easy to determine the share which belonged to each cohort for there being    castella upon the whole wall and so  0 milliary intervals just four of these intervals would fall to the share of every cohort it may not be amiss to try how far we can find out the several cohorts belonging to the respective legions and on what part of the wall each legion and cohort seems to have been employed  if we divide the wall into four equal parts the  st and  d quarters reckoning from the east seem to have been built by the legio secunda augusta and the  d and last by the legio sexta victrix for at the east end of the wall we have express mention of the legio secunda augusta in the stone at denton which is about six miles from the end of it and we have six if not seven cohorts of this legion mentioned in those centurial stones found in this quarter viz i ii iii v viii ix besides there is a seeming appearance of the  th at wallbottle this quarter reaches near to halton sheels or to the next castellum east of it which is above two miles east of halton chesters in the second quarter which reaches from hence to the second castellum west of the housesteeds we have the legio sexta victrix on a centurial stone about four or five miles from the beginning of this quarter and at housesteeds and little chesters just at the end of it the same legion is mentioned upon two altars and two bricks but the legio secunda augusta does not occur in this space at least not on any stone that can be relied on there are no cohorts upon any stones in this place distinct and visible except the  th and  0th but no doubt several others have been mentioned upon the many stones found here though the numbers are now quite effaced in the third quarter which reaches to old wall near watch cross in the county of cumberland we have legio secunda augusta mentioned again several times indeed the legio sexta victrix occurs upon a stone in cambeck fort but probably it has been inserted in the face of that fort when it was repaired upon some other occasion the cohorts of this space are the  st  th  th and  th which i believe have all belonged to the legio secunda augusta in the last quarter which i believe was built by the legio sexta victrix i meet with no centurial stones except one at drawdikes which seems to have belonged to a cohort of another kind the legio sexta victrix is upon fine stone at carlisle but no particular cohorts appear in this space  julius caesar when he made his first descent upon britain brought over only two legions with him which were the  th and  0th this latter was his favorite legion and both together made but an army of   000 foot at the most the horse belonging to these legions never reached this island and the foot the same year were transported back again to gaul  the next year when caesar made his second descent he brought over five legions with him and  000 horse which seem to be all the horse that belonged to these legions there is nothing in the history whereby it can be known what legions these were except the  th which is mentioned by caesar these likewise returned back again to gaul the same year in which they came over as the two legions had done the year before  during the three succeeding reigns of augustus tiberius and caligula it is plain the romans had no footing in britain  under claudius who applied himself in good earnest to the reduction of britain a considerable army was sent to this island the emperor himself afterward coming over in person this army consisted of roman legions and other auxiliaries though the historians have not told us expressly what they were either as to their number or names but considering the small success of julius caesar before and the much greater conquests this army made it is highly reasonable to suppose it was superior in number to the greater of caesars which consisted if the legions were complete of above  0000 men it is presumed that the army sent over by claudius consisted of four legions with their proper auxilia and the usual number of horse belonging both to one and the other and this army so composed would amount to more than  0000 men any conjecture as to the number or names of the auxiliary cohorts must be uncertain and doubtful but both the number and names of the legions may be certainly collected from some incidental passages of tacitus they were the second called augusta the  th   th and the  0th usually called valens victrix each of which are mentioned in the inscriptions inserted in this work  as we have no evidence from history that any new legions were transported by nero but that the same continued which had been sent over at first by claudius so it is plain from the relation of the battle with queen boadicea that the four legions last mentioned were here under nero in whose reign this battle happened for according to tacituss account of this matter the  th legion was surprised and destroyed by this queen the   th and the vexillarii of the  0th were in the battle and the second though in britain was absent from the fight through the fault of poenius posthumus their commander who fell upon his own sword when he heard of the glory the troops had acquired in that engagement  of these four legions one continued very late and another to the last the legio xx vv though it continued very long here yet it seems to have been recalled before the romans had entirely abandoned the island for it is not mentioned in the notitia the legio secunda augusta is mentioned there and so seems to have continued here to the last and to have been the only one that was kept here during the whole time for though the legio sexta victrix did also continue to the last yet this came not over till the reign of the emperor hadrian the ninth legion seems to have dwindled away entirely or else the small remains of it were incorporated with the legion sent over by hadrian  it is remarkable that the legions which continued long in britain seem for the most part to have been jointly employed in carrying on the most considerable works or wars that have been in this island thus they were jointly engaged in building the wall in scotland and most or all of them in erecting those in the north of england and the legions and legionary cohorts seem to have been the only soldiers who were employed usually in erecting forts or raising fences auxiliary cohorts appear by inscriptions to have been concerned in some other buildings but forts and fences seem to have been the province of the legionaries agreeable to that passage in tacitus the praefectus castrorum and legionary cohorts who had been left among the silures for erecting fortifications thus among all the inscriptions found upon the roman wall in scotland there is but one that mentions any auxiliary cohort as having a hand in the work but always either a legion or a vexillation of a legion and i take it for granted that all the centurial inscriptions upon the face of the wall in the north of england and which probably were inserted there at the time of building it respect only the legions and legionary cohorts and yet the stations upon the wall as well as most of them elsewhere were garrisoned by the auxiliaries the legio secunda augusta came into britain in the reign of claudius under the command of vespasian and continued in it as long as the romans had the least footing here in hadrians time this legion was in cumberland at netherby and beaucastle and in the western side of northumberland and so probably had their share in the work of hadrians vallum or when in the advanced stations of netherby and beaucastle they might be posted there to secure those who were employed in that work in the beginning of the reign of antoninus pius they were most probably upon the eastern part of the roman wall in northumberland in severuss time it is very probable they were employed upon the wall that goes by his name  the legio sexta victrix is usually thus expressed leg vi v to which is often added p f that is pia fidelis for that it is to be read so rather than pia felix it is certain from a great number of inscriptions and other testimonies that this legion was a long time in britain and it is equally certain that it came not over so soon as the others the account of this legion whilst in britain must be taken chiefly from such hints as ancient inscriptions afford us i do not find it is mentioned in any inscription belonging to the southern parts of this island it is probable that they made no stop in the south but marched directly by the usual rout to the west end of the vallum and had their share in raising that work we have several inscriptions on the wall and near it in northumberland and cumberland wherein this legion is mentioned as at stanwicks cambeck fort burdoswald little chesters housesteeds and other places some of which from the character and other circumstances may be supposed as ancient as hadrians reign the most of them do certainly belong to the time of severus in the former part of the reign of antoninus pius they were in scotland and had their share in building the wall there probably they marched along our watlingstreet in the north either to scotland or from it or both and in their march the sepulchral inscription might be erected for a soldier of this legion which was found near richester in northumberland whether this legion had taken up its stated quarters at york before the reign of antoninus pius and continued there between the time of building the vallum and their march into scotland i cannot certainly determine however after their return from scotland and about the middle of antoninus piuss reign they were settled at york for ptolemy places them there and there i believe they statedly quartered till the very last though they marched at a distance from this place upon special occasions thus for instance this legion was certainly employed upon the stone wall of severus as appears from several of the centurial inscriptions found on that wall which bear the name of this legion perhaps several of its cohorts might be dispersed into some neighboring stations though york was still the place of its stated quarters thus according to mr gales conjecture by the legio gordiana in the inscriptions at lanchester in the county of durham we are to understand the legio sexta victrix the first cohort of this legion must then in all probability have been detached at that time from the legion at york to assist in building the works mentioned in these inscriptions this was in the reign of gordian and so after this legion was settled at york  the legion called valeria or valeriana according to some or valens victrix according to most is another of these legions which were at the first sent over into britain by claudius in the roman inscriptions it is thus expressed leg xx vv but critics and antiquaries are not well agreed in reading the former v some will have it to stand for valens and others for valeria or valeriana the motions and employments of this legion seem to have been much the same with the legio secunda augusta it is probable they were jointly concerned in erecting hadrians vallum though we have no inscriptions to prove it that this legion was employed in building the roman wall in scotland under antoninus pius is clear from several inscriptions found on the wall mentioning this legion or their vexillatio and the quantity of the wall which they built if the altar found at benwell fort was erected by a centurion of this legion at the same time as the other was by a centurion of the legio secunda augusta this legion must probably have been thereabout in the former part of antoninus piuss reign either doing somewhat upon hadrians vallum or in their march against the caledonians  one would expect that this legion bore its part in building severuss wall but among all the centurial inscriptions upon the face of this wall there is not one of this legion or of any cohort said to belong to it and yet it appears by an inscription that this legion was employed in some work at the station at whitley castle the ancient alone or alione  in the beginning of the fifth century about the year  0  theodosius the second when but two years old was made emperor and joined to arcadius and honorius this theodosius reigned half a century and it is evident that in his reign the romans quite abandoned this island it must have been much about this time those usurpers started up in britain echard says the inhabitants and troops that were quartered in britain fearing least the vandals should pass over the sea and subdue them with the rest revolted from their obedience to honorius and set up one mark whom they declared emperor but they soon deprived him of his life and dignity and placed gratian in his room who was a countryman of their own within four months they murdered him too and conferred the sovereignty upon one constantine not so much in respect to his courage or quality for he was a very inconsiderable man in the army but in regard to his name which they looked on as fortunate hoping he would do as much as constantine the great had done who was of the same name and had been advanced to the imperial dignity in the same island this new prince immediately after his promotion passed over into gaul and taking with him the very flower of the british youth so utterly exhausted the military force of the island that it was wholly broken and the island left naked to new invaders  britain being thus drained and exhausted both of the roman soldiers and its own youth was according to gildas and bid after him much harrassed by the picts and scots and other invaders upon which they applied to the romans for help who sent a legion to their assistance but the last certain account of the romans footing in britain i believe is in the notitia if it hold true that this part of it which relates to britain was wrote before the middle of the fifth century or under the reign of theodosius the second at which time the roman force was much abated though their soldiers were not yet finally withdrawn from britain for besides a considerable number of auxiliary forces there were yet two legions at least remaining in this island and the romans seem still to have been in possession of that part of the island which lays to the south of severuss wall though of no part beyond it the stations upon the wall were well garrisoned at that time but excepting the kentish coast and the northern frontiers the garrisons in the other parts of britain were very thin and widely dispersed and the rest of england was entirely naked on the other hand it is certain to use echards words that under the reign of valentinian the third africa spain great britain and almost all gaul germany and illyricum were dismembered from the western empire now valentinian the third began to reign with theodosius about the year     and died in     so that we may safely affirm that in the beginning of the fifth century the roman power was become low in britain and near the middle of that century the romans had entirely quitted the island  i have dwelt long on this subject mr warburton in his preface says all antiquaries that i have conversed with who have made the accustomed tour of europe allow the picts wall to be the most superb remains of roman grandeur that is now to be seen on this side the alps and he adds the venerable remains of monasteries and castles with other monuments of antiquity are not to be equalled in any nation or country whatsoever  from the manuscripts of the late roger gale esquire extract of a letter from mr john horsley to roger gale esquire   th march       had we an accurate map of england and a faithful and impartial account of matter of fact where there are stations and military ways and where there are none i am fully convinced that many difficulties might be removed and the time and situation of several ancient places be determined with a great deal of certainty about which at present we are much at a loss  this was the method i took in the northern counties first to be well assured from occular demonstration where there were any visible remains or certain proofs of roman settlements and then to compare this account with that in the itinerary and notitia imperii the success of this method was not only answerable to my expectation but vastly beyond it  after this manner i have settled i humbly think beyond exception the stations per lineam valli and the  0th and part of the  d iters in antoninus and at the same time perfectly reconciled that itinerary and the notitia imperii to one another  john horsley   extract of a letter from mr horsley to roger gale esquire   d june      sir i acknowledge the receipt of another most agreeable letter from you which came last night and return you my hearty thanks for it i am sorry that you who have so many affairs upon your hands should give yourself the least concern to make a speedy return to mine i only beg leave to communicate to you any thing that occurs and that you would at any time honor me with a line or two at your convenience and leisure  i have nothing more to add with relation to the antiquated cup unless it be to beg leave to ask whether the size shape and loose bottom if any at all the bottom which had been of thinner metal than the rest was consumed and worn out by time and rust  r g favor its being a common patera if it be admitted a patera i despair of seeing any conjecture more plausible and ingenious than your own  i have sent you enclosed a hasty sketch of my scheme concerning the stations ad lineam valli that you may better understand what i have said with respect to the places mentioned on this scale your great candor will excuse any marks of haste and inadvertence i take the stations rigorously upon the line of the wall to end with tunocellum and other five to have been a kind of secondary series proceeding regularly from east to west viz glanoventa lanchester alone whitley castle confirmed by an old inscription brementuracum brampton if not old perith olenacum old carlisle and virosidum elenborough or if we suppose a transposition of the two last places then virosidum may be old carlisle upon the river wiza and olenacum elenborough upon the river elen  i hope to get all the stones that have been discovered at riechester into my possession and then i shall reexamine them all with the greatest care and attention i can and if i discover any thing more i shall be sure to acquaint you with it  you must be right with respect to the vardii and therefore i thank you again for having been my apollo  the altar with the inscription deae syriae is yet at connington but the latter part of the inscription together with the upper stratum of the stone is quite gone i guessed it might be gallorum but vardiorum will suit the vacant interval better if that can be relied on as exactly represented  my representation of the inscription at lanchester was not in my last so just as it ought to be  vardior   req i cannot find the copy though i have sought for it and therefore may not be exact in the position of the letters but the upper line which goes before in the inscription is upon one piece of an altar and the lower line with the following part on another piece that was lying separate from the other when i put them together they tallied with so much seeming exactness that i concluded they had made one and the same altar but if we suppose them to have been fragments of two different altars the difficulty you mention will entirely vanish  i am much obliged to you for your account of the military ways if i can make any improvements upon it i shall presume to communicate them to you  salmon i have but found it was not safe to follow or trust him too far  i think it was in the monthly atlas that i read of a roman inscription at st johns chapel at shattesbury in the wall but though i use that author as having made a collection or abstract of some principal matters yet he has no great authority or esteem with  sir yours etc john horsley   stationes ad lineam valli segedunum station at the east end of the wall near cousinss house pons aelii

wallis called the black dykes where he says lead bullets have frequently been found an occasional and temporary defense cast up for a small force of modern date and in no wise resembling those which fortified an ancient camp  thirlwall castle is seated on the edge of a rock above the little river tippal a dark and melancholy fortress much in ruin it may be called with propriety the stronghold rather than seat of the family of thirlwalls john de thirlwall   king edward iii robert   0 queen elizabeth eleanora married matthew swinburn esquire wallis it was vaulted within and defended by a strong wall without the thrilwall castle floor of one of the apartments was lately cleared and discovered to be of singular construction consisting of three tiers of flags laid upon stratas of sand some of the walls are nine feet thick the casing in many places has been taken away to erect the adjoining tenements the builder has even been afraid of the light for the apertures are no larger than those in the staircases of ancient castles the whole carries the appearance of a horrid gloomy dungeon where its ancient tyrants dealt in deeds of darkness the last of the thirlwall family eleanora sold this castle with its demesnes to the earl of carlisle  under the south front of this castle the roman wall crosses the tippal and stretches up the opposite eminences the name of thirlwall by some authors has been derived from those breaches made in the wall by the scots in their incursions  spelmans calculation of the roman forces stationed on the wall makes them amount to the number    00 allowing  00 to a cohort exclusive of a whole legion and    detachments of horse and foot on other stations and attendants on the emperor constantine created an officer styled comes spectabilis litoris saxonici who commanded seven companies of foot two troops of horse the second legion and a cohort to guard the coasts in the reign of nero some authors allege the roman army in britain consisted of  0000 ph trans no       in passing down the road below thirlwall castle we perceived a large stone lay in the way which bore marks of the sculptor we had curiosity to examine it and found it the head of a colossian statue measuring in circumference near five feet cut on a ragstone it seemed to appertain to some statue of jupiter and probably was rolled down the steeps from carrvoran and lodged in the river tippal  a mile from thirlwall lays  wardrew famous for its spaw the waters have been analized and require not my pen to repeat their virtues so well known to the public the conveniences for a few visitors are narrow but commodious enough the situation is retired not much of the romantic the walks are solemn and the whole scene befits a mind that carries its ideas and meditations to distant regions for there are few objects present which either elevate or entertain calmness and tranquillity are the effects such sameness of subject insinuates to the mind and indolence with that degree of ease styled negligence succeed to take the place of pleasure  we now proceeded by the military road and made a little excursion to the left to  walltown formerly the seat of the ridleys part of the ruins of the old castle remaining travelers are shown a well among the cliffs where it is said paulinus baptized king egbert wallis but it is more probable it was edwin king of northumberland such spectacles gratify the religious enthusiast who would be in transports on viewing this hallowed font  from thence to  great chesters is little more than a mile the vallum of this station is very distinguishable of an oblong square near the dimensions of carrvoran the interior parts rugged from the ruins of many buildings in the course of the notitia this station is called aesica it was garrisoned by the cohors prima astorum but no inscriptions have been found here that mention this or any other cohort  great chesters must be reckoned mr horsley says among the forts that have been well preserved the ramparts about it are very visible some part of the original stone wall is standing a good height the ditch is also to be seen on all sides but toward the east where it is somewhat flat on the west side there is a double agger and ditch the ruins of the rampart on this side are very high several regular courses of stones are to be seen in this side of the rampart where the ruins have been cleared out the praetorium is very visible being about  0 yards from east to west and  0 from north to south to this is joined another parallelogram at the east end of the same breadth with the praetorium and    yards from east to west this i take to have been the questorum on the north side of the praetorium are large ruins of some considerable building which probably was a temple on the south side of the fort has been a regular entry part of the jambs and some other stones are remaining entire which may show for what purpose such stones must have been which are found in other roman forts some pieces of an iron gate and hinges have been found in the ruins not long ago from this gate there goes a paved military way to hadrians vallum which is distant about    chains which way is also continued till it joins the other military way the outbuildings are most considerable on the south side though there are also some on the east there are vast ruins of buildings in this field which as usual has a gentle descent and is open to the south  the distance between this station and little chesters the next in my rout is about three miles and three quarters and here again all the castella are visible being four in number besides one more which seems to have fallen in with the station at great chesters the interval here again between the castella is seven furlongs  a little to the west of great chesters near a house called cockmount hill the picts wall begins again to ascend the rocks from great chesters to this place the ditch is but faint except for two or three chains where it is distinct  a little to the west of walltown and between that and carrvoran there is a part of the wall which is in the greatest perfection of any now remaining in the whole track it is about three yards high as i before observed has about    regular courses and at one part    of the facing stones entire  as for hadrians vallum it is visible all the way till it comes near carrvoran it passes near low town just on the south of it and particularly the vallum or rampart on the south brink of the ditch is here very visible mr horsley says he was informed there were the ruins of some roman works at low town but upon viewing them nothing like it appeared they look he says somewhat like the houses of moss troopers which seems confirmed by what camden says that he durst venture no further this way for fear of them he mentions carrvoran on the one side and carraw on the other so that the two chesters and the housesteads must have been the stations that he was afraid to visit  the distance between great chesters and carrvoran is almost two miles and a quarter in this space there are three castella and all of them visible  the remains of broken altars and some effigies are scattered on the eastern side of this station but of no significance to the antiquary as the inscriptions are totally obliterated  the following fragment was dug up here and is thus given in camden i cas m avr seve rvs mecander pfe aug horrevm vetv state co ar svmm coh ii astvrvm sa a solo restitveri provincv arecnt maximo leg w gprp sal marti med lega tvs co ii et dext   near a mile on the south side of this station is a monumental stone about three feet high with the effigy of a man in a nich cut in relief with the inscription as represented in the plate    mr horsley no    gives a monument very like this in figure but the inscription varies greatly dis m pervicae filia f which he reads dis manibus pervicae filia fecit  a funeral monument erected for one pervica by her daughter who is not named  i took the drawing and inscription with great attention and am induced to believe the whole monument is here represented with truth  at the mill gate a stone placed upsidedown has this inscription d m ael mercvr riae cornicvl vacia soror fecit   mr horsley gives this inscription in the same manner but his drawing of the stone has a mans head above the inscription this might be sunk in the earth as the stone now serves for a gatepost and is reversed dis manibus aelio mercuriali corniculario vacia soror fecit this is a funeral monument erected for aelis mercurialis by his sister vacia a cornicularius was an inferior officer under the tribune mention is made of the cornicularius by m laetorius mergus the tribune by valerius maximus and suetonius speaking of orbilius the grammarian says in macedonio corniculo mox equo meruit the name of this officer is upon several monuments in gruter and occurs frequently in the notitia he was a kind of a clerk or secretary and in the lower times of the empire he was rather of higher rank or quality than before  camden says this was the second station of the dalmatians called in the old book of notices magna and that sir robert cotton took from hence the two following inscriptions pro salute desidieniae  liani pre et sva s posvit vot  ao solvit libe ns tvsco et basso coss from these consular names the date of this inscription is     in the christian era  deae svri ae svb calp vrnio ag  icola leg avg pr pr a licinivs  lemens praef  iii  a  ior  this by some antiquaries is supposed to be dedicated to the syrian goddess astarte mr horsley has objected to camdens reading but dr stukeley in his carausius thinks it is confirmed by the altar in mr grahams collection at netherby inscribed to that goddess in the greek character and language cohortis primae hamiorum camden gives the following reading deae suriae sub calphurnio agricola legato augusti propretore licinius clemens prefect unto the goddess suria under calphurinus agricola lieutenant of augustus and propraetor licinius clemens the captain this calphurinus agricola was sent by antoninus philosopher against the britons about the year of our lord   0 at which time some cohort under his command erected this altar mr horsley has treated of this inscription as being found at little chesters under which head i have inserted it in the notes lucian describes the goddess suria with a turretted crown on her head a tabor in her hand set in a car drawn by lions this was the favorite divinity of nero till he grew so weary of his devotions that as the translator of camden has it he defiled her with his urine besides the inscriptions before mentioned mr horsleys work contains the following  lxi dis manbus dicatum sabinae hinae regulus duilius  the inscription itself is thought to be sepulchral and i have given a reading of it suitable to this opinion but i must own that the seemingly plain appearance of an o at the first rather than a d and the manifest deficiency in the stone and inscription at the beginning of the lines have raised a strong jealousy in me that it has been i o m d for jovi optimo maxmo dicatum though i this be the truth i know not why the following name sabini or sabae should be in the geive the last word is uncertain and very probably the greater part of the inscription is broken off for otherwise the plane of the altar does not seem to bear any  proportion to the capital the figures at the top are so much defaced that i know not what to make of them the first looks almost like a toad which we find upon another altar or two in this collection the other perhaps is a dog or wolf but very obscure mr wabrtes imagining this inscription to have some reference to the ae sabinia because of the word sabine as i suppose concludes this ce to be hunnum  now in the dean and chapters library at durham  lxiii  not far from great chesters near a wicket or hatch at cockmount hill lies a curious sculpture exposed to all the injuries of the weather by which and barbarous hands it has suffered too much already mr gordon was the first i believe who discovered or took any notice of it but his draught has several defects in it the most considerable of which is the omission of the two eagles on whose wings the victories stand that support the vexillum each eagle rests upon the branch of a tree and the boar on the right plainly appears to take hold of the stock of the tree on that side as if he endeavored to tear it up the other boar attacks the vexillum and lays hold of the tree on which the other eagle is perched with both his feet i think there can be no doubt but the boars and trees were designed to represent this wild and woody country as it then was and the roman ensigns often signify a roman settlement this sculpture therefore plainly denotes the roman conquest of this country their victories over the inhabitants and their making a settlement here in opposition to all the attempts of their enemies the heads of the eagles are both broken off but the rest of them is very distinct  lxiv centuria cohortis septimae maximiana posuit  under this number are expressed two centurial stones now placed in the sore wall of a cowhouse adjoining to a house called allaley almost half way between great chesters and carrvoran one has the centurial mark and the number of the cohort tolerably plain the name of the century is obscure but it must i think been maximiana nothing more is certain about the other but that it has been erected by some cohort or century  lxiv centuria valerii maximi  this is of the common centurial kind and has nothing remarkable in it it was found at a small rivulet called haltwhistle burn near great chesters  an urn was also found at this mill     we passed a monument on the left hand placed on a hill consisting of three large erect stones or pillars two of which seem broken off in the midst they are called the mare and her foals appearing to be monuments of some memorable action and not druidical as has been conjectured their figure and position in no wise corresponding with any monuments of the druids  at a little distance from the chesters and ne the   th mile stone are four tumuli placed in a square figure which mr wallis says were cut through by one curry a dissenting minister whose curiosity disturbed the ashes of the dead reaping nothing but the salina which had consecrated the remains of the interred without being able from this undertaking to discover to what age or people these monuments appertained mr wallis has the following remarks on the interment of the ancients  the romans were not very careful to separate the human ashes from the rest but sometimes put coals and other things into the urn their urns were of gold silver and other metal of glass stone and marble but most generally of potters earth trajans was of gold they were of all figures but commonly round and bellied those of metal generally embellished with sculpture and bass relief urns for persons of distinction were either set under marble monuments or in niches of sepulchral chambers severus provided his before his death it is said to have been of porphyry or of alabaster the ashes of persons of quality were usually sprinkled with wine before they were collected into an urn  postquam collapsi cineres et flamma quievit riliquias vino et bibulam lavere favillam assaque lecta cado texit chorinaeus aheno virg aen soon as the pile subsiding flames no more with wine the heap they sprinkled over then chorinaeus took the charge to place the bones selected in a brazen vase pit salt was used in their solemn sacrifices as well as in urn burial  dant fruges manibus salsas virg aen urn burial is not so ancient as the present mode of interment burning the dead is first attributed to the greeks and herculus is said to be the first of the greeks who used it this he did to free himself from the obligation of an oath he had sworn to bring back a youth to his father from the siege of troy and he had no way of doing it but by presenting him with his ashes from the greeks this custom passed to the romans but it was not general among them from the authority of pliny it appears that it was not used in many families and that sylla the dictator was the first of the cornelii whose body was burnt which is the reason assigned by antiquaries why we find roman bones both burnt and unburnt it was the choice of some because they would preserve their bodies from the resentment of their enemies ths probably was syllas motive it is supposed the gauls had it from the romans the celtics or ancient britos from the gauls but it is not so easily accounted for how the danes and other nations called juli and angli saxons and germans came by it it is believed they had it from the grecian customs and learning and that they all laid it aside on the introduction of christianity  to distinguish which are roman danish or british tumuli has been observed to be difficult some antiquaries pretend to fix them from their shape but that is reckoned guesswork unless inscriptions arms or coins be found in them the latter of gold silver or copper but neither of them of brass instruments and coins of that metal belonging to the northern nations and where they are found in tumuli unquestionably roman they are supposed to have been taken from the enemy and thrown into it in honor of the deceased the roman tumuli were cespititious or mounts of earth like those here such was hectors viridi cespite virg

and the great civilian sir thomas ridley knt l l d  from thence we passed to  little chesters a small roman station laying on the western side of bardon burn now called the bowers on account of the trees which cover it it does not contain above three acres of land in its enclosure the vallum of which is very distinguishable forming an oblong square with obtuse angles the via vacinalis from carrvoran to walwick chesters passes close by its northern side near which a roman military guide stone is standing and at a mile west another and again another mile further west a third in a direct line these stones are cylindrical six feet four inches in circumference and near six feet above ground on one of these is the following inscription bono reipvblicae nato the letters large and coarse no doubt this was a compliment to the emperor then reigning and not an uncommon one  little chesters was the vindolana of the romans where the legio sexta victrix kept garrison as also the cohors quarta gallorum as the inscriptions found here prove  mr horsleys description of this station is as follows  this station is south from both the walls near a mile and three quarters but stands on the military way before mentioned which is very visible for a considerable space from this station so that little chesters must be reckoned among those which belong to the wall it being in this rout and the only military way which belongs to it coming from the wall and returning to it  there are two or three forts more as carrvoran and cambeck fort detached to the south of the wall though none so far as this yet this is not above half a mile from hadrians vallum  this is one of the least stations on the wall it is only seven chains long from north to south and four broad from east to west the ramparts are visible quite round and very large but the ditch is near filled up the town or outbuildings here have been chiefly to the west and southwest of the fort there being a small brook to the southeast and a descent from the station to it the praetorium may be distinguished and there seems to have been some towers at the corners of the fort and perhaps two in the sides of the ramparts  severuss wall which keeps upon the precipices all the way is almost at a mile distant from this station  the royal society received a few years ago some roman sandals found here a roman hypocaustum or sudatory was discovered here of which dr hunter gave the following description  it was a square room vaulted above and paved with large square stones set in lime under which was a lower apartment supported by rows of square pillars about half a yard high  the upper room had    flues in the walls then open and appearing as niches the pavement and roof were tinged with smoke these sudatories from this description were certainly heated by flues in the wall like the modern stoves mr horsley speaking of it says it looks very like a balneum with the hypocaustum below it and somewhat of this nature i saw at lanchester and risingham at the latter place it was not far from the praetorium  an engraving is given by mr horsley of a sculpture found here the principal figure of which represents mercury he gives the following description of it mercury is represented with his caduceus in his left hand and purse in his right above his right arm is somewhat like a petasus or perhaps a cap of liberty the head of the figure and upper part of the stone is broken and confused so that we cannot be certain whether or no mercury has had his petasus on if we could be sure that he was here represented as wearing his petasus on his head i should then have thought it more probable that this other figure was the cap of liberty mercurys loose and flying chlamys is visible and beside him an altar with this inscription upon it deo mercvrio a camillus lays the incense on the altar mercury is usually represented with a juvenile briskness according to the poets description omnia mercurio similis vocemque coloremque et crines flavos et membra decora juvente virg aen iv     it is well known what sort of people were peculiarly devoted to mercury callidum quicquid placuit jocoso condere furto hor carm  whether the ancient inhabitants of this part had the same disposition with their posterity who dwelt hereabouts in camdens time and to whom we owe the good laws for preventing of theft upon the northern borders i shall not determine  mr warburton presented this stone to the royal society in whose musaeum it now is  it is observable that the trading inhabitants of this country held a solemn festival to mercury on the   th of october  a centurial stone now at ridley hall was found at this station inscribed imp caes traian hadriani avg leg ii avg a platorio nepote leg pr pr   a large stone lately found here now placed in a field at archy flat as a rubbingstone for cattle is rudely sculptured with the figure of a deer under the shade of a tree with two fauns at his feet this seems to have been an ornament to some small temple of diana which perhaps stood near this place as pilasters and capitals of the doric order were dug up some few years ago with multitudes of stags horns the remains of the sacrifices to that goddess on the   th of august when the hunters held their festival and offered the devoted stag besides the inscriptions already mentioned mr horsleys work has the several following ones  lii gallorum vota numini ejus principis optimi turribus fundamenta posuerunt sub claudio xenophonte legato augustali propraetore curante  great numbers of inscriptions have been found here but most of them are now lost or destroyed there is one which seems to have been the most curious and useful the inscription whereof is now quite destroyed this stone was some years ago removed from little chesters to beltingham where the masons wrought it up for a gravestone and utterly destroyed the inscription  dr hunter published the inscription in the philosophical transactions no     from the origal the inscription is curious and useful upon a double account both as it has probably contained the name of the chors quarta gallorum and so proves this place to be vindolana and alo it seems to me to mention a new propraetor claudius xenophon whose name i remember not to have met with elsewhere either in the inscriptions or history for i am persuaded that the three last words in the fifth line have been leg avg pr pr and what is wanting in the last lne has been the name of the person who took care of the work the tors here mentioned might be some of those upon the ramparts of the station which are still very vsible dr hunter says the field where this inscription was found goes by the name of the bower the title optimo principi together with the name of a new legate who does not occur in any hitory would incline me to ascribe the monument to trajan during whose reign the roman historians are silent as to britain but as there is nothing in this inconsistent with several of the succeeding reigns and it is doubted whether the romans had any considerable footing here in trajans time we cannot fix the date of this inscription with any certainty  the two following inscriptions camden places at great chesters in these notes i follow mr horsleys course and numbers for the sake of the readers readier reference to his works  liii deae su suo calpornio agricola legato augustali propraetore aulus licinius clemens praefectus chortis primae hamiorum vel cohortis quartae gallorum  it is plain from camdens own account of his journey that he went no further along the wall eastward than a little beyond carrvoran the altar now before us was erected to the syrian goddess lucian among the ancients and seldom among the moderns have professedly treated on the subject of this deity and sir isaac newton says it is one of the names of venus it is very certain that what is physically the same is often represented by several deities and the same deity has several names considered under different relations or as confering different benefits thus cybele ceres veta rhea and tellus all signify the earth and dea syria is only another of cybeles names who is usually called the mother of the gods the like may be said of apollo and several others as for the inscription the letters in the first line and calp in the second and part of the ag in the third are yet very plain and distinct though the rest of it sce camdens time is entirely gone together with the outer or upper stratum of this part of the stone deeper than the cut of the letters which obliges me to take most of the inscription from camdens copy and this i have observed to happen frequently when the inscription is cut along the plane of the stratum but when it is cut across or through the several strata the letters are more lasting and much better secured and thus the romans uy cut their inscriptions there is at the end of the first line something like a cross which camden has omitted but with what design this was done i am unable to say calphurnius ag was propraetor or lieutenant here under marcus aurelius the inscription confirms and ilutrates the historians testimony adversus brittannos quidem calphurnius agricola mssus et capitol in vet script hist aug p     as this determines the time or at least the reign under which this altar was erected what cohort this licinius clemens commanded is not so clear to me from the inscription i know some read it cohors prima hamiorum at large and have so represented it but this i doubt has been mere conjecture it is plain that the letters in the last line are not placed at a due distance and that the letters on each side should be farther removed from the four and the same room which is sufficient for harniorum will do as well or better for gallorum and i cannot but suspect this to be the true reading the former inscription favors this conjecture and so i read it at first sight of the copy without considering where it was found if this conjecture should be admitted this inscription does further confirm the station at little chesters to be vindolana  live pro salute desidieni aeliani praefecti et sua sacrum posuit voto solvit libns tusco and basso consulibus  this after the authority of camden i also presented to the reader as belonging to great chesters  it is an altar erected by some person whose name is not expressed for the safety of desidienus aelianus the prefect and for his own the letters are but meanly cut and of the later and ruder form there is a small break in the right side of the altar whereby a letter or two is defaced but the rest still continues legible i think voto in the fifth line must be ex voto as usual and then there is no difficulty as to the meaning the writing part of the word libens upon the plane of the altar and part upon the base is observable but the s for sacrum in the end of the fourth line is not uncommon the express date of this inscription adds to its value namely when tuscus and bassus were consuls that is according to camden in the year     but in the fasti consulares     where the former name is fuscus instead of tuscus  lv fortunae populi romani caius julius raticus centurio legionis sextae victricis  to this place also belongs as i suppose that noble altar erected to the fortune of the roman people by cajus julius i find no centurial mark in the inscription unless the c at the beginning of the last line which mr gordon overlooked be supposed to stand for centurio or else the mark before leg through mistake turned the wrong way but i rather take this to be only a stop and the c to be the praenomen of the person there is nothing very peculiar in manner of this inscription unless it be the humor of making the size of the letters in the different lines so very unequal  this altar is deposited in the dean and chapters library at durham  lvi legio sexta victrix  this is the impression of the legio sexta victrix in the usual manner upon two roman bricks which were found here  lvii antoni  pio   this is an imperfect inscription upon the fragment of a very curious and beautiful stone the nature and grit of which is finer than usual and the remaining letters very fair and well cut i can only guess that the inscription may have been to the honor of one antonines and that the word in the second line may have been pio and perhaps pra in the last for praesectus  lx this is a small but fine stone and a curious sculpture it came from little chesters but is now in the jamb of a door at ramshaw field a single house about a mile or more southwest from this station it has not been observed or published before though it very well deserves a place in such a collection the sculpture manifestly represents a roman verillum with a pegasus on one side and a seagoat on the other and in the vexillum an inscription in very small letters iii ch vexi as i have given it the first line except the cross stroke of the h was very visible vegetius tells us it was the ancient custom of the romans to put the number of the cohort or century upon the vexillum which was a square piece of cloth fastened upon a transverse piece of wood this after constantine had the name of labarum     the reader will pardon a short digression which the subject of roman sacrifices necessarily leads me to when we read of piles of stags horns bones of sacrificed animals and such remains of religious acts or of hecatombs and mighty slaughters which stained the altars of roman devotees we might conceive the country abounded in cattle or the havoc and waste of such a profuse gift to the gods would endanger a famine the first impressions of the unlettered reader on these acts of devotion would mislead him into an idea that these sacrifices were only a lavish destruction of animal beings under the irrational presumption that the gods delighted in the service of burning carcasses but by attending to the ceremony we are relieved from this mistake and acquit this learned and polished people of such an error against common sense  from national prejudices they had assigned persons to the attributes of the great creator whom they universally confessed and presumed to depict them as being distinct emanations from the supreme by the figures of apollo bacchus pallas ceres and all the multitude of their divine personages yet by the intelligent and wise the religious services paid to the images of those attributes were in fact and from the heart addressed to the god of nature seneca says it is of very little consequence by what name you call the first nature and the divine reason which presides over the universe and fills all the parts of it he is still the same god he is called jupiter stator not as historians say because he stopped the flying armies of the romans but because he is the constant support of all beings  they call him fate because he is the first cause on which all others depend we stoics sometimes call him father bacchus because he is the universal life that animates nature  hercules because his power is invincible  mercury because he is the eternal wisdom order and reason  you may give him as many names as you please provided you allow but one sole principle every where present  thus if the roman devotee petitioned for success in war he resorted to the temple of mars or raised to him an altar and so on through the chain of those images with which their pantheon was crowded  this error arose very early in the world and before letters communicated wisdom and science it is no wonder it prevailed almost universally among mankind  the eye carries images to the mind most immediately  the mind thus impressed was warmed into an energy which nothing but outward objects could convey to the ignorant besides we find those personages who had rendered themselves important to their country and by their superior talents and virtues won the love of the people in commemoration of such their excellencies had their images erected and became representatives of the divine attributes  here we trace a strong influence to promote devotion the love borne to the very person whose image was so erected the danger to religion among the vulgar is obvious and was proved in the event the great architype was forgotten and the smoaky and inanimate statue became the idol of the vulgar worship  let us now examine the sacrificial rites  the altars which remain in britain are chiefly formed of one stone like the pedestal of a column above the cornice are two rolls commonly called the horns of the altar the center rises in a conical figure in which is an aperture wherein was placed the charcoal and embers for the ceremony these altars were fixed before the statue of the god to whom the devotee paid his rites or at the ostium of the temple which during the time had its gates thrown open or otherwise they were erected in groves consecrated to the divinity the priest together with the devotee dressed in white garments emblematical of purity and innocence characteristics presumed most acceptable to heaven went foremost in the procession the animal ordered for sacrifice had its horns gilt or its forehead bound with white fillets decked with garlands and crowned with the leaves of that tree which it was supposed the deity most affected but in fact that which was esteemed emblematical of the peculiar virtue of the deity then addressed several attendants walked in the procession amongst whom were the public crier the musicians the aruspex or diviner and all those whose office it was to slaughter and dress the animal as soon as the victim was brought the priest laying one hand on the horns of the altar began the ceremony with a most solemn and devout prayer either for the public weal or the private prosperity of the devotee offering sacrifice as the occasion required the sacred fire being placed in the aperture of the altar the priest strewed corn and frankincense meal and salt upon the head of the animal then taking the patera a shallow basin in which was contained the wine he touched it with his lips and after giving it to those who stood near him to do the same poured it between the horns of the beast then plucking some hair from between them he cast it into the fire and turning his face to the east drew his knife along the animals spine from head to tail as the ensign or mark of consecration after which the inferior officers performed the slaughter the carcass being opened the aruspex examined the intestines and if deformed deficient or diseased he pronounced the omens inauspicious if on the contrary healthy and vigorous the heart large and the animal parts strong the indications were propitious after this ceremony particular small parts were placed on the embers to occasion a pleasant savor and the rest was dressed for a solemn festival here we view the ceremony in its proper light the sacrificial rites were no more than a public exhibition of the cattle given on some singular occasion when they were presented before heaven with prayers the priest imploring a blessing it is a doubt with me whether by men of enlightened minds whose understanding overlooked the idol and whose religion spiritually addressed the only true god these were not acts of piety and fervent devotion equal to most we find in this age t  more places than  contemplating with amazement the  the te and the  even of the  so that him it could  of the military princi  all other people the  the gauls more strong truly  way they  be more vic than o nations but that they re   d sys ca p   we have avoided scylla and sunk in charybdis to reform the abuses of the heathen world we have too much abolished ceremony and from fervor have fallen into a slovenly lethargic indolence which comprehends so little of piety that men often find their minds even during the act of kneeling abstracted from the divinity and wandering in worldly occupations we have taken away the idol which betrayed the vulgar but have left them in such jeopardy that few even remember there is a god religious rites warm the mind pure and sentimental devotion only befits the most enlightened and most learned ceremonies catch attention as it were in wiles and those who would think little of prayer may sometimes be induced thereto almost involuntarily by joining in or being present at religious rites the soul full of wisdom worships in silence but wayward minds soon sink away from such spiritual service the contemplation of the deity by the enlightened and wise is so replete with wonder and inspires such reverence that silence becomes it best but the ignorant mind conceives little more than its wants and the god of miracles with such is concluded in the god of daily bread i reverence the roman in his sacrifice it was a noble exhibition of piety an august mode of supplicating the deity the solemnity of craving a grace on the appointed festival in these rites was strikingly devout in this boasted age of christianity where is the devotion attendant on the hecatombs of a lord mayors feast the hecatombs of the ancients were festivals on great and memorable events and were preceded by the most solemn rites of consecration  a commencement of festivity worthy the imitation of the most enlightened nations  dr stukeley in his carausius says in reading the roman history we see such a spirit of religion breathing in general upon every occasion through all they did as a nation as is no where else to be found in the least comparable to enumerate particulars would make an agreeable volume i can only take notice that it makes a great part of their story so honest so warm so grateful was their zeal to heaven at every public act that providence could not but look favorably upon them wink at what they were ignorant of as the the apostle professes acts xvii  0 and prosper them accordingly every single person of any note had a part of his house consecrated like as our private chapels called the lararium upon every success we read of their vowing temples on occasion of misfortune pestilence floods thunder and the like they consult the oracles order public lustrations supplications and sacrifices even their theatrical spectacles began with an act of religion many altars in their circs and places of games they never began or ended a war took up the military standards every morning without an act of religion a libation of incense in their calendar most days in the year have some religious solemnity look into their sculptures and monuments and observe the extravagant expense and pomp of their religious processions even their coins are countersigned with some deity and innumerable sculptures of their emperors sacrificing incensing they never began their harvest their vintage without a sacrifice without the flamen dialis gathering the first bunch the genius of the people and city were ever represented with a patera in its hand before an altar incensing in short religion makes the greatest part of the history the greatest part of those authors that write of their customs the greatest part of the monuments coins and sculptures which are now come to our hands of this truly magnanimous and virtuous people and if we read polybius particularly we obtain a just idea of the noble spirit the honor and uprightness of the roman senate which made them courted by all the world religion cannot be separated from roman history because in their way they were the most religious of all people and for that reason providence gave them the empire of the world  to return  in the wall of mr smiths house at the west end of the station of little chesters an altar is preserved inscribed marti victori coh iii nerviorvm prefect i caninvs   i have seen a brass coin struck in honor of the festival of mars held on the  st of march  mr wallis says the late rev mr walton was possessed of one upon which was the figure of mars armed and helmeted a shield on his left arm and a sprig of olive in his right hand  the distance between the stations of great and little chesters is about three miles and three quarters in that space there are four castella visible and one which seems to have fallen in with the station at great chesters the interval between each is seven furlongs from the manuscripts of the late roger gale esquire  extract of a letter from mr john warburton to roger gale esquire   st nov      i cannot possibly recover your essay upon the four great roman roads unless you think fit to favor me with it it is strange there should be but four recorded when there are such numbers of them and more that the greatest of them all should want a name this is the erningstreet  r g viz that which comes from the roman wall near dunbritt fryth in scotland to rochester in northumberland where antoninus begins his first journey and from thence continues its course by corbridge echester langchester binchester piersbridge caterick aldborough and i believe might be thence traced directly forward through london to dover and this without interfering with any of the four great roads mentioned except where they cross or accompany it for a few miles  it is well if higden or whoever was the first describer of these ways was not mistaken in his placing the watlingstreet the course he has taken for it seems too short and out of the way and i rather agree with talbott who thinks that antoninuss second journey was along it viz from the west end of the picts wall to southampton which i think much more probable as it enters this county on gatherley moor  i was surprised to see so visible a roman station in the yorkshire dales as that of ethelburg l near arigg and for some time could not imagine what it had been but now begin to have hopes of proving it to be the fourth station of antonines  0th iter bremetonacis and that it stands on the military way i discovered in northumberland called the devils casway  i have observed a military way to range along the road from thirst to eafingwold but where it should come from or lead to it comes from cataractonium and leads through thirsk easingwod aldby der and wighton delg to brough over against wintringham upon the humber  r g am yet at a loss but look upon it to have been the direct road from cataractonium to eboracum without going by isurium and seems to be more entire and of a newer form than the others i have observed in the north as if it had been erected nearer the declension of the empire  i have below given you the sketch of an altar which some workmen found in a vault as they were lately digging by my order in the platform of a roman castrum by the picts wall which as it is the beautifullest and most entire i have ever seen am thinking to present it to the king to be set up in st jamess gardens mr wanley my lord oxfords library keeper was treating with me about it and several others in my possession in order to have them placed in the new library at wimple but we could not agree about the price   found at chester in the wood      fortunaie p r c ivl rat le vi vv alt p   lab p   fortunae populi romani coius julius rationalis legionis vi valentis victricis this altar i have since seen at durham and a print of it is in mr gordons iter septentrionale by both which it appears that the third word in the last line is raet and therefore should read caius jul raticus  r g   i am well assured the third word in the last line is rat but as it is in northumberland i have not had an opportunity of a strict examination as you desired me to make the place where i dug it up is by mr camden called magna but by the vulgar chester in the wood its situation is on a very entire raised military way that runs from carrveran to newbrugh on the inside of the picts wall but for the most part at two miles distant from it my workmen had not dug above two yards in the area of the platform before they struck into a cault of a very irregular figure three quarters of a yard in height and three or four in breadth and length all blacked on the inside with smoke and at the first opening smelt like burnt straw this great altar lay with its face downwards and by it another of the same size but broke in pieces and the inscription imperfect  bedale   st nov      j warburton the vault wherein the above mentioned altar was found seems to have been made originally for receiving the offal of the sacrifices and sweepings of the altar the smoke with which it was blacked proceeding from the hot ashes that had been thrown into it as did also the smell like that of burnt straw i was told when i was at cirencester of much such another vault with ashes and burnt bones in it when the romans were forced to quit this country they might very probably throw these two altars into the vault and cover them up to preserve them from being profaned by the barbarians that possessed themselves of it upon their retreat and they were effectually concealed from them by their lying bid so many hundred years as they did  there is nothing difficult in the inscription the word rationalis is not very common it being more usual to style an accemptant the officer here denoted a rationibus it proves also by the vi v v that the legio sexta was called valens victras as well as the vicefima  r g        returning to the military road we passed a tumulus of considerable magnitude there are several laws barrows or tumuli near the military way particularly four where the way goes off to great chesters called the four laws it has been called an exploratory mount but its situation contradicts this appellation as it commands no extensive country or important pass  the roman station now called  housesteads presents itself in a confusion of ruins laying on an easy descent  this was the borcovicus of the romans  the first cohort of tungrians appears by several inscriptions under different prefects to have been stationed here some inscriptions prove this cohort was also in other places but the number and variety of monuments erected here plainly show that their settled quarters were at this place and continued here the latest  mr horsley says i cannot say that hadrians vallum has made the south rampart of this station but i think it has passed not much to the south and seems to have made a small turn just at the brook in order to come near if not up to it the southern boundary of this station is uncertain though the other limits are distinct the ditch about the station is also flat and obscure severuss wall makes the north rampart from south to north it is about five chains and from east to west about seven the area of the most northerly part of the station is nearly plain but the south part is more upon a descent than any other station that i remember i think the praetorium is visible and the ruins of a temple near it the vast ruins of the roman station and town are truly wonderful and a great number of inscriptions and sculptures have been found and many yet remain at this place the town or outbuildings have stood upon a gentle declivity to the south and southeast of the station where there are streets or somewhat that looks like terrasses  the best view of the walls and the greatest variety is between walwick and housesteads  from this station there seems to have gone a military way to little chesters some faint vestiges of which i thought i observed but was not certain as such a military way might be of service for marching forces from one of these stations to the other so it might also be further useful for a more convenient passage from housesteads to carrvoran or to any other stations along the wall more westerly near to this way and to that part of housesteads where a temple is supposed to have stood are some old wrought quarries now grown over with grass  the distance between little chesters and housesteads is about a mile and three quarters and the distance between housesteads and that part of the wall which is directly opposite to little chesters is about a mile and three furlongs and in this space there are two visible castella the interval between which seems to be just about six furlongs this is the least interval between any two castella upon the whole track of the wall the reason of which may be the distance of the station at little chesters from the wall  the headless effigies of the deae matres remain on the spot they are said to be the tutelary deities of the forest of lowes are represented attired in a short robe to the knee each holding something circular between their hands supposed to be the work of the thracian or syrian auxiliaries and are of rude and illproportioned sculpture mr wallis says on chapel hill a place not far distant the romans had a temple on the eminence where fragments of doric capitals were found not many years ago one consisting of two torusses plain and many broken columns mr horsleys work contains the following inscriptions and sculptures found at this station  xxxvi jovi optimo maximo et numinibus augusti cohors prima tungrorum militum cui praeest quintus virius superstes praefectus  this and the following altars were dug up at a place now called the chapel hill supposed to be the ruins of a considerable temple the inscriptions were not long after the discovery of them published in the philosophical transactions by dr hunter by mr warburton and lately again by mr gordon they are also in camdens britannia the unusual shape of the i in the capital is remarkable the tungri mentioned in this and the following inscriptions were a people of belgic gaul the next thing which deserves consideration is what we are to understand by numina augusti in this and other inscriptions where those words occur writers are not agreed as to this and probably it has not always the same meaning here and in some other instances it should seem as if those deities were meant to which the emperor was peculiarly devoted and that they who erected the altars complimented the emperor by paying honor and professing their devotion to the same deities we find several inscriptions in gruter that are consecrated numinibus augusti and one like this i o m et numinibus augusti and that addresses were made to the gods in behalf of the emperors notwithstanding they were often complimented as deities themselves is likewise evident from many of their coins on which we have jovi apollini marti mercurio consevatori augusti with several others of a like nature however some have thought that if this interpretation should be admitted jupiter optimus maximus would be excluded from the number of the emperors deities but in answer to this it may be said that either the words may be so understood as if it had been expressed jovi optimo maximo et ceteris numinibus augusti or else that jupiter is by way of eminency distinguished from the lares or tutelar gods of the emperor which were often many in number and made up partly of deceased persons as well as other fictitious deities so flavius vopiscus in his life of aurelius speaking of his going into the temple of heliogabalus says there he found that image of the deity which he saw favoring him in the war and julius capitolinus in the life of aurelius addressed to the emperor dioclesian says the statues of marcus antoninus are to this day set up in many houses among the family deities and soon after he is to this time esteemed a god as you always thought and do think most sacred emperor dioclesian who worship him among your deities not as the rest but in a peculiar manner but in some other inscriptions the word numina in the plural is applied to a particular deity so we have numina dianae in horace and in virgil numina phoebi and what comes nearer to our purpose the same poet when speaking of augustus himself and by his sordid flattery ranking him among the gods but uncertain where to place him uses these words au deus immensi venias maris actua nautae numina sola colant on the other hand numen in the singular is sometimes joined to a plurality of deities as in virgil non haec sine numine deorum eveniunt  xxxvii jovi optimo maximo et numinibus augusti cohors prima tungrorum cui praeest quintus julius maximus praefectus  it is plain by the tenor of this inscription the i o m jovi optimo maximo was placed in the capital as well as it appears to be in that of the former though nothing of this nature appears in any of the copies which have been published before but upon a close view of the original i plainly discovered the i but could not perceive neither o nor m this however inclines me to charge this defect rather on time and the weather than upon the workmen but without these letters it is evident that the sense of the inscription is not complete the et with which it beg as on the plane of the altar necessarily supposing somewhat on the capital on one side of this altar is a praefericulum and on the other a patera each included in a waved ornament i dare not venture positively to say these inscriptions are as old as antoninus pius though i know of no other in this form but these here at housesteads and one upon the altar at benwell which last expressly mentions this emperor nor do i think that any objection against this antiquity of them can be taken from the cut of the letters or the numeral stroke above the i which have nothing in them that favors the lower times i only add that some gentlemen choose to read these inscriptions cohortis primae tungrorum milites  xxxviii  this is a large and very fine altar but the inscription entirely gone i have given a representation of one side of it because the patera and ornaments about it seemed to be singular perhaps the circle and cross line at the bottom may represent the place of the patera in the temple mr gordon says there were five or six altars within the ruins of this temple i saw no more here but the two preceding the rest which that gentleman describes with a good many more sculptures and altars lying at the bottom of a field southeast of the station in which field remain the visible ruins of streets and buildings  xxxix jovi optimo maximo et numinibus augusti cohors prima tungrorum cui praeest quintus jus maximus praefctus  ths with the nine followng inscriptions and sculptures were lying as i said before at the foot of the field where the roman town stood and most of them were also erected by the same cohort of the tungrians and this in particular when under the same prefect or at least one of the same name as no    quintus julius maximus the letters i o m at the top were obscure and have been overlooked by mr gordon the us in the fifth line were visible enough and no doubt are the last letters in the word maximus and probably the word praefect has followed but this is effaced the letters are not so large or so well cut as in the oer inscriptions  xl deo mai quintus flavs maternus praefectus cohortis primae tungrorum votum so ens merito  this is erected to the god  by quintus florius matermus prefect of the same cohort the globe on the base of the altar is remarkable and the letter a is without a transverse the inscription is well cut and has nothing of the lower empire in it  xli herculi cohors prima tungrorum militum cui praeest publius aelius modestus praefectus  probably this may be later than the former it is dedicated to hercules by the same cohort under a new commander publius aelius modestus nothing more is remarkable in it  xlii matribus cohors prima tungrorum  this is to the deae matres the name of the cohort is very plain and distinct and part of the word matribus but the rest is obliterated only half of a v appears in the under line which i take to be the v in the last syllable of tungrorum but the commanders name if it ever has been mentioned is not now visible these matres are supposed to have been local deities and worshipped at this place  xliii jovi optimo maximo and at the bottom praefectus  this is another fine altar here erected to jupiter optimus maximus and i believe by the same cohort though the names both of the commander and cohort are now destroyed by the weather and only part of the word praefectus left visible upon the plane of the stone i cannot find that this altar has been published before  mr warburton has given us a funeral inscription at this place in his map of northumberland which i could no where meet with upon the strictest enquiry according to his representation it is thus dm hvrmio le vbasni mil coh i tvngror be praef capuris her e c this copy is without doubt incorrect though the main design is obvious enough the same cohort of the tungrians is plainly mentioned and enough beside to show that it was now under a different commander from any of those whose names occur in the former inscriptions i imagine we must read it ds manibus hurmio leubasinus miles cohortis primae tungrorum cui praeest perhaps capurnus or capurnius haeredes secerunt it is plain that this may justly be reckoned among the inscriptions in which the name of this cohort distinctly appears under five different commanders besides two or three more which are doubtful by reason of their being defaced these inscriptions strongly prove this place to be borcovius the station upon the wall where according to the notitia this cohort was in garrison  xliv centurio legionis sextae victricis piae fidelis votum solvit libentissime merito  this inscription is upon a piece of an altar the upper part being broken off and lost it has been published in the philos transactions by dr hunter and more lately by mr gordon but in both the remains of two imperfect letters in the break at the top are neglected and yet i take these to be material because the last is plainly the half of an inverted c the usual mark of a century or centurion but the name of this centurion of the  th legion and the god to whom the altar was dedicated are gone the inscription as to that part of the form of it may be compared to the altars and inscriptions upon them at benwell i read ll libentissime because it is supported by the best authorities and seems also the most easy and natural some choose to read libens lubens as the words occur at length in some inscriptions and others read libens laetus from the expression of cloanthus in his vow  di quibus imperium pelagi quorum aequora curro vobis laetus ego hoc candentem in littore taurum constituam ante aras voti reus but i keep to the usual reading sometimes we have mm which must be read meritissimo  xlv  at this place also are several curious sculptures most of which are described by mr gordon and in the main very justly but the account we have of them in camdens britannia seems to me not so exact for what is there called a mercury is plainly a victory and we are told of the statues of jupiter bacchus and a flamen which by all i can possibly discern are only the figures of two roman soldiers and three female figures supposed to be the deae matres or campestres the first is a victory standing upon a globe on the right foot the left being cast behind in the attitude of alighting or of taking flight on her head is a cap of a conic figure she is naked to the waist from a girdle a vest hangs in plaits to near the knee and from thence a flowing robe open before which shows the right leg the arms are broken off by the wrists the wings are half elevated the sculpture is good in alto relievo and the figure is placed in a nich  xlvi  this is also in alto relieo being the figure of a roman soldier at length in the usual military dress his bow in his left resting one end on the ground and his poinard in his right his sword hung by his side at his girdle and his quiver with arrows behind his right shoulder this figure also stands within a nch  xlvii  this is the figure of another soldier in his accoutrements but somewhat imperfect his two belts are visle crossing each other agreeable to the description of ajaxs armor in homer the broader belt over the right shoulder must have been that of the shield as we learn from the same poet  xlviii  these are three female figures seated the draught given by mr horsley he says was taken from the originals they are naked to the waist and their legs naked up to the knees and therefore he says i know not the reason why mr gordon who published them before has drawn them with their legs covered down to the ancles the figures have lost their heads these are not improbably supposed to be local goddesses or the deae matres or campestres we have three female figures represented together at two other places in this roman station which i shall describe in their order the vessels which these three have in their hands appear not unlike the colathus or modius on the heads of sorapis and fortune and often upon the heads of the roman emperors which may favor the opinion of their being the deae campestres who in these parts had the care of corn and country affairs and were supposed to give plenty whether these vessels be of that sort or whether they represent those in which the sorts or los were cast which also might be a proper attribute of the deae matres and whether there being three in number has any relation to the number of the parcae i shall leave to others to explain perhaps their savage dress may have some reference to that madness which was always ascribed to the matres or ancient prophetesses  xlix  about a furlong or less to the east near the side of a brook and close to a hedge are three other female figures seated each in a separate chair mr gordon takes notice of two only but a third was also lying near the others covered with grass and bushes the heads and hands are broken off from all the three and the drapery is somewhat different in all of them they are intended to be represented as sitting the first in the plate is naked to the waist her vest makes several folds above the knee and falls about half way down to her ancles the rest of the legs covered with a kind of stockings the second is naked to the waist the garment also forms many folds about the knees and falls about half way down the legs which are naked to the feet the chair in which this figure is placed has two side feet and a center foot round which a cord is twisted passing thrice round each leg as binding the figure to the chair the third figure has its vest up so as to conceal the breasts the robe descends a little below the knees from whence the lower parts of the legs are naked mr ward subjoins i am inclined to think these six figures were originally placed in some temple built in the roman town adjoining to this station together with the three following whom i do not take to be deities but rather priestesses two of which hold some sort of vessel in their right hands as a symbol of their office the difference of their habit seems to favor this opinion likewise that of their posture for they are standing which is the posture of attendants but the others sit which was always esteemed a posture of majesty  at this place there lies a broken altar of the largest size but no visible letters upon it  l  in the station itself and against a hedge were three other female figures but standing which are published likewise by mr gordon the sea goat and two fishes above must probably have some reference to britains being an island the sea goat occurs in some other sculptures found in the north  the vessels which these hold in their hands do not appear like the patera they may possibly be intended for vases of the same sort with those in the hands of the three sitting only in another position if they are vessels into which the sorts were put these figures may represent the action of throwing them out it may not be amiss to observe here that virgil in the prophecy of helenus uses the expression sortiri fata for the decrees of heaven  sic fata deum rex sortitur in the sculpture inscribed deabus mairabus in montsaucon the goddesses are represented standing in an attitude not very unlike these the middle figure there holds fruit either in a vessel or in the folding of her garment the figure on the right hand holds a vessel he calls a patera and she on the left holds a branch downwards that great antiquary observes that the ancients usually made three of those goddesses that were worshipped in the plural number whether good or bad as the gorgons the graeae the daughters of phorcus as also the parcae the sirenes the harpyies the hesperides the stymphalides the graces nay even the sibyls and the muses according to the most ancient authors  li  mr gordon when upon the spot with baron clark dog up from the ruins of the roman town here a small statue of a soldier in the roman military habit holding a spear in his right hand and resting with his left upon a shield this is now in the barons collection  there are also in the same honorable persons collection two other small altars found here but as they have no inscriptions or any thing remarkable about them i have not given the draughts  besides all these there are likewise several other pieces of sculptures altars pedestals and pillars scattered here and there and one piece of a fine channelled pillar lying in the midst of the station there may be two or three other stations in britain as burdoswald elenborough and lanchester that exceed this in number of inscriptions but none i think equal it as to the extent of the ruins of the town or the number variety and curiosity of the sculptures which yet remain here  there is one inscription more which belongs to this place that was published in the transactions by dr hunter several years ago the doctor says the stone lay against a hedge at about a quarter of a mle distance i myself saw a stone in a hedge which i believe to have had a sepulchral inscription upon it and at nearly this distance but there was not one letter visible upon it the inscription was imperfect when the doctor saw it who gave it thus ni venori g ofersionis romvlo alimahi mansvetio sinicioni revince qvartionis eresi procvravit delf us ravtionis ex g s  ni venotrionis filio  g  osersionis romulo alimabionis mansuatio senecionis revincio quartionis erigi procuravit delfius rautionis ex gratia sua   i imagine the to have been a sepulchral monument erected for several persons whose fathers  ended  as well perhaps as some of their own i am apt to think these remaining i spand have been read as above mr ward disliking the expression ex gratia sua chooses  germ a speri  dr s had the  suppose of the common sepulchral kindly which he saw at this  to be found     the next remarkable place we arrived at was  shewingsheels between the military road and the wall near the   th milestone the remains of a roman station about sixty yards square which camden concludes was hunnum where the notitia places the wing sabiniani mr horsley thinks it belonged to hadrians vallum and became useless when severuss wall was built  we advanced to  carrawbrough near the   th milestone the roman station procolitia garrisoned by the first cohort of the batavians severuss military way appears to enter the east gate of the fort and go out at the west a great part of the rampart here still continues very entire especially on the east side and severuss wall which forms the north rampart is in good preservation the ditch is most visible on the west here it may plainly be seen that the corners of the forts were not strictly angular but turned off in a quarter of a circle  according to mr horsley the buildings without this fort have been chiefly on the west side where some years ago a well was discovered with a good spring the receptacle for the water is about seven feet square within and built on all sides with hewn stone it is now almost filled up with rubbish there had also been a wall about it or a house built over it  from this fort to the village of carraw hadrians vallum and ditch are not very conspicuous but severuss wall is very visible though the ditch is obscure about half a mile southwest from carraw upon a high ground is a square fort now called broomdykes it is as large as the fort of carrawbrough and probably has been for exploration or for the aestiva of this fort about halfway between carraw and thropfellhouse there seems to be some vestiges of the smaller military way supposed to have gone close by severuss wall from turret to turret  for about a mile the walls keep near to each other and for that space are themselves and all their members very large and conspicuous several of the regular stones appear in severuss wall and the united military way is very noble after this the walls part and take different courses the north agger of hadrians fortification continues after the separation large and high is mixed with stones though no regular pavement appears whereas severuss military way after this parting appears little raised but regularly paved hadrians vallum keeps the low ground all the way whilst severuss runs along the brink of the precipices which in some places seem to have been made steeper by art in order to render them more inaccessable for this reason severuss wall is for this space very crooked whilst hadrians in the main is pretty straight they have made no ditch to severuss work when they had the advantage of a precipice nor was there the least occasion but in these intervals between the rocks they have often drawn a ditch and in these places usually erected their castella  after their separation severuss military way accompanies the wall pretty closely and is generally for the whole space that the walls continue so far parted visible and distinct yet the way does not follow every smaller winding of the wall upon the tops of the precipices but generally takes a shorter course and passes along the slope of the hill from castellum to castellum in the shortest and most convenient line that it can this is very remarkable at the first great turn of the wall after it enters upon the precipices the wall itself is almost all this way visible in an eminent degree and sometimes it only wants the battlements as near busy gap which is an aperture or pass between the hills so called where there is an opportunity of crossing the wall on horseback thus it passes by shewingsheels houses leaving shewingsheels castle on the north mr horsley further observes that this castle or something else near it is called a square roman castle in the new edition of camden and camden himself thought this was the station of hunnum but he says he saw nothing that was roman about it the castle itself in ruins and the moats about it are undoubtedly of a much later date and he adds i observed several trenches thereabouts particularly a large and long one which reaches from busy gap cross the passes between the mountains but these are all on the north side of the wall and must certainly have been made in later times for securing the neighboring passes probably they are no older than the times of our famous moss troopers who might conveniently shelter themselves among these hideous mountains and mosses the height of one of these rocks is near forty yards perpendicular warburton p    horsleys brit rom but in other parts they are considerably higher as such steep rocks are a sufficient fence of themselves the wall has not in these parts had either strength or thickness equal to what it has had in others the remains here are not so considerable though it seems very improbable that any of the stones especially in some places could have been removed in the hollows between the rocks besides the addition of the ditch and a castellum here and there the wall itself seems to have been stronger and thicker where there is a small break of the precipice inward the wall forms an internal angle fetching a compass in other cases it passes directly from one rock to another and then is usually continued down the side of the one and up the side of the other except where the descent is almost perpendicular in which case it is only carried close to the side of the rock beginning again at  which was all that was needful or practicable  the distance between housesteads and carrawbrough is somewhat more than four miles and five furlongs all the castella between these two stations are very visible being five in number but their distances are a little unequal the two first intervals from carrawbrough are just seven furlongs but the next is only six there is a turret near busy gap the distance of which from the nearest castellum is i find just onefifth of the interval between that and the next castellum  an altar found here and deposited in the dean and chapters library at durham has the following inscription fortune coh i batavor cvi praest melaccinvs marcellvs pref fortunae cohors prima batavorum cui praeest melaccinus marcellus praefectus this altar dedicated to the goddess fortune is most curious and valuable because by mentioning the cohors prima batavorum it confirms the station to be procolitia the altar is still entire and the inscription easy enough to be read mr horsley reads the commanders name melaccinus as it had been read before dr hunter reads it marcus flaccinus but on a review mr horsley still thought the second letter in the last line but one to be rather an e in mr horsleys work we have the following sculpture and inscriptions  xxxiii  mr warburton in his map of northumberland gave a drawing of a curious altar and inscription being a sepulchral stone or an altar without any focus at the top erected to the dii manes by tranquilla severa for her and here is the inscription is read thus dis manibus dicatum tranquila severa pro se et suis votum solvit libens merito this is deposited in the dean and chapters library at durham the principal curiosity in the form or manner of the letters is the expression of the v and i together like a y though it is only placing the v above the i as is very evident both from the original and the draught i have given of it for in the fourth line there is a visible distance or separation between them though it is not so in the second which with some other small matters has been overlooked in the copies published before the letters are strong and well cut though involved and connected the name tranquila i find in this and other inscriptions with a single l  xxxiv  this stone contains only a human figure which mr gordon supposes to represent a man but to me the face appeared rather to be a female i took the stone to have been sepulchral and the image may possibly have been the abovementioned tranquila severa  xxxv centuria alexandri posuit  this is an inscription of the centurial sort that has not been regarded before it is upon a broken stone lying at the door of one of the houses at carrawbrough   it is remarkable that this altar has no focus  we searched for the sculpture which mr wallis says was found at this station and is built up in a gable of the house at caraw he describes it as a curious representation of neptune with his trident the stone on which this effigy is cut is placed so high that it is difficult to come near it is almost square about    inches on the longest side and has so imperfect a resemblance of neptune that i should not have known what it was had i not seen mr walliss description  we arrived at  walwick the country through which we had passed from walton to carraw was dreary and had not our minds been engaged with objects of antiquity would have proved wearisome in some parts we had distant prospects various in their beauties and rendered more striking by the barrenness over which we looked upon them when we came within five miles of chollerford the vales of north and south tyne opened upon us and the scene was filled with all that pleasing variety which arises from cultivation receiving additional beauties from the incidents of the season verdant meads dotted or patched over as it were with the hay that stood in pikes the improvidence of the people in northumberland touching their hay is singular it is put together in several heaps or as they are called there pikes in the field where it is won and stands in that form for many weeks before it is gathered into the mow or stack by which negligence much is wasted in the bottoms and outsides of the pikes mixed with rich fields of corn some cut and others ready for the sickle interspersed with woodlands and stately trees formed the landscape where several gentlemens seats and well built farmholds were dispersed the whole graced with the winding streams of tyne  the claybuilt cottage and nakedfooted poverty were no where in view  in walwick the roman wall is in good preservation from the seat of thomas dixon esquire the prospect is filled with the most agreeable subjects  to the left houghton and swinburn castles are seen with the villages of hunshaw and chollerton  the north branch of the tyne with a fine stone bridge of five arches at chollerford ornament the front ground  and to the right a wide cultivated country terminated by the town of hexham  the seat of henry tulip esquire also commands a beautiful prospect over this valley  the inn at chollerford tempted our stay a spacious room built for the resort of the neighboring gentlemen afforded us a pleasing view upon the river whilst excellent accommodations indulged us with that degree of satisfaction which truly constitutes the travellers ease  we visited  walwick chesters situate near the elegant newerected mansion of john errington esquire  this was the cilurnum of the romans camden cal it gallana where as some authors assert the cohors prima vangionum was stationed but according to mr horsley it was garrisoned by the ala secunda astorum it is placed on an inclining plain near the banks of north tyne the vallum forms an oblong square with obtuse angles in length from east to west   0 paces and in width   0 paces in mr warburtons plan it is set out as being   0 feet long and  00 feet broad the site of the praetorium at the eastern end is very distinguishable with two entrances through the vallum answering to each side of the praetorium and a road leading down to the river the ground within the vallum is crowded with the ruins of stone buildings which appear to have stood in lineal directions forming streets two on the south side and two on the north intersected in the middle by a cross street from north to south on the south side without the vallum and fosse many ruins of buildings appear and some on the north i remember on a tour in cumberland i found caerleud near wigton crowded with ruins  this being the first station in my tour where the direct appearance of regular streets was observed i thought it the properest place to introduce the following remarks  the roman manner of encamping a large army according to polyhius and other ancient writers is thus represented    fig   the praetorium a square plot every side containing  00 feet for the generals lodging and his train the ground so chosen as might be fittest both for prospect and direction  fig   a street  0 feet broad leading from the midst of the praetorium to the gate fig    fig   a street directly opposite to the former of the same breadth leading from the praetorium to the gate fig   on the right hand of which street was lodged one legion with her auxilia and another on the left now from the praetorium toward the gate   measuring out   0 feet employed to uses hereafter specified we are there to begin the lodging of the common soldiers  fig   a row of lodgings for the horsemen of the first legion divided into  0 partitions according to the number of turmae in polybiuss legion which consisted of  00 horse and   00 foot the first turma being quartered in the lodging nearest to the praetorium and the rest in order toward the gate   these lodgings lay lengthways and open upon the street    each side being  00 feet so that to one horseman they allowed a standing equal to a square a little exceeding    feet every way next comes the lodgings of the december ordines triariorum  0 lodgings for the  0 ordines or manipuli triariorum primae legionis with their centurions and under officers joining back to back with the lodgings of the equites and opening into the street     of  0 feet broad primus pilus being quartered next to the praetorium and so in consequence toward the gate   where all the decemi ordines do lodge every one of these lodgings in length  00 feet in breadth  0 feet lodged  0 triarii and a rateable part of the velites which considering the proportion that one of the ordines triariorum bore to one of the ordines principium and hastatorum and the number of velites in polybiuss legion falls out to be    persons according to which reckoning to one footman they allowed a standing equal to a square somewhat more than eight feet every way  on the other side of the street     the lodgings of the december ordines principium primae legionis and at their backs the lodgings of the december ordines hastatorum opening the one into the street     and the other into the street     being also  0 feet broad each of these  0 lodgings was square every side containing  00 feet and lodged   0 sui ordinis and    velites beside proportionably as in tabernaculis triariorum there was for half as many men half as much ground  on the other side of the street     are the lodgings of the auxiliares equites in dextro cornu and at their backs the lodgings of the auxiliares pedites in dextro cornu the horse opening into the street     the foot into the void place between the lodgings and the trenches of which further notice will be taken now the equites auxiliares of a legion the extraordinary band being deducted amounting according to polybius to  00 horse allowing to  00 legionary horse  0 lodgings of  00 feet every way we are to allow to these following the same proportion  0 lodgings each  00 feet in length and   0 in breadth to quarter the one as conveniently as the other likewise the footmen after the deduction of the extraordinary band being    0 that is     persons for every lodging  upon the left hand of the street    are the lodgings of the second legion with her auxilia in the same proportion and order in all points with the first and so we have the breadth of the camp from the utmost auxiliary footmen of the one legion to the like of the other    0 feet or   0 paces accounting five feet for a pace  aa the via quintana  0 feet broad passing from side to side through the whole breadth of the lodgings so named a quintis ordinibus which quarter all upon it in this street as being in the middle of the soldiers quarters and therefore the best adapted to that purpose was holden a market forum rerum utensilium  bb of the space of   0 feet between the soldiers quarters and the praetorium  00 feet was employed in the via principalis especial care was taken to beautify this street and keep it clean as being the usual place of

praefecti socioum their train horses and carriages             are the lodgings of the six tribunes of the first legion the first lodging answering directly to the legionary horsemens quarter and the last to the street     with passages  0 feet wide between each c c c c c c are the lodgings of the praefecti answering exactly to the breadth of the auxiliaryquarter with a void space of  0 feet between the third and fourth tent and so on the other side for those of the other legion  d d a cross street  00 feet broad before the praetorium where i presume was held the watch mentioned by polybius  e e e e here were lodged the extraordinarii equites and extraordinarii pedites the plot was   0 feet by   0 feet answering the quaestorium and part of the praetorium for the extraordinary band of the auxilia primae legionis consisting of  00 horse and   0 foot the footmen quartered toward the trenches and the horse toward the street and so on the other side for the other legion  f f f

being chosen men of the extraordinary band of the auxilia primae legionis the foot quartered toward the trenches the horse toward the praetorium and so on the other side for the other legion there was a reserve therein for voluntarymen who from kindred or friendship or on other respects attended the general these selecti and voluntarii did not only says polybius quarter near the general but also in marching and all other times of service were continually attendant upon the general and the quaestor in the nature of a cohors praetoria  h the quaestorium a plot  00 feet by     feet for the quaestor and his train with their treasure and provision for the pioneers carpenters smiths armourers etc with their tools and officers there was also the auguraculum and peradventure the public prison  i the forum a plot equal in dimensions to the quaestorium this was the place of all public assemblies and the tribunal with the seat of estate here were probably those seats of which josephus makes mention on which the tribunes and centurions sat in judgment to decide the controversies happening between the soldiers here were placed the eagles and ensigns of the legions with the bearers aquiliferi and signiferi certain images of the gods and in later times of the prince and his children and sometimes of his great favorites tacitus describing a solemn assembly in that place says inde eques hinc agmina legionum stetere fulgentibus aquilis signisque and simulacris deum in modum templi medio tribunal sedem curulem and seeds effigiem neronis sustinebat  the eagles were placed in little chapels dio lib   says in all the roman armies there is a little chapel and in it a golden eagle does stand the ensigns were placed sub dio as indeed being certain long spears covered with silver with the princes image hanging upon them they could hardly be placed under a tent  k k k a void space  00 feet broad between the lodgings and the trench calculated for the easy issuing of the troops and to prevent the enemy throwing fire upon the quarters also used for lodging the cattle  l the vallum in the summer camps composed of earth defended by a palisado of large stakes bound together these were carried by the common soldiers usque ad septenos vallos says livy in the vallum were contrived platforms like turrets where the engines were placed the balistae and catapultae  without the vallum was a ditch six feet in depth at least  there were four gates in the camp  the porta praetoria the chief gate placed opposite to the enemy the backgate opposite to the former placed for the convenience of water and forage  the other sides had each a gate opening to the via principalis  this camp was calculated for two of polybiuss ordinary legions with their auxilia which was the ordinary army of one consul  the general officer over the camp was named praefectus castrorum who ordered the staking out the camp its being kept regular and clean to order the trenches and ditch and to quarter the soldiers  to keep in order the smith carpenter engineers and artificers was an officer named praefectus fabrum  the ruins which appear at walwick camp must necessarily induce an enquiry from the traveller in the first place what number of men were stationed there  by every monument remaining to us one single cohort only appears to have held each of these stations on the wall   manipuli made   centuries or ordines   manipuli   cohort  0 cohorts   legion legio romuli  000 legio plutarchi  000 legio freestate  000 legio war with hanibal  000 legio polybii   00  stations defended by a stonebuilt vallum were the permanent ones and winter quarters the encampments in summer were defended by a rampire of turf with a palisado of which as i mentioned before i presume the corona vallaris was a pattern composed of pointed stakes and an outward ditch few if any remains are left us of such to ascertain their situation or magnitude in a square of   0 paces by   0 there appears room sufficient for a cohort when lodged in tents or hovels of wood but when in that square you have allotted room for the praetorium with the apartments of the chief officers what kind of tenements of masonwork must there be erected in streets which should contain that number of people with their accoutrements wives families and household stuff  i should conceive the excellent discipline of the roman army would not admit the women within the wall of the camp except only in time of imminent peril but that they were lodged in the suburbs  the enquiry naturally brings on this result that those edifices whose remains now appear in some of the roman stations for they are not in all are of more modern date were built after the romans forsook this island by the britons or their saxon allies and arose in that era in which the appellation of caer or city was given to many of them the britons in their dispirited situation on the final retreat of the romans would necessarily resort to those barriers and strongholds which the romans had filled i am induced to believe that no castle of any considerable magnitude was erected by the romans in this country the castellum or turret on the walls was not worthy the appellation of castle being as i before observed most probably no more than a tower to guard the gate or no better than a mere bastion to command the vallum our castles of which such noble remains appear at this day are of much more modern date and derived from the saxon and norman visiters the strongest fortifications of the ancient britons were formed of piles of loose stones heaped to a ridge and reduced into a circle or a square such a vallum was difficult to be surmounted by assailants the vallum of the roman permanent station was built of hewn stone inside and out those which i have seen most perfect among which lanchester in the county of durham is one were formed of stones about    inches long and  0 inches deep of rough ashlerwork the outside of the wall was perpendicular and might in its original strength be    or    feet high and eight feet thick at the foot but thining or decreasing on the inside toward the top by steps and gradations at the distance of about    inches and the summit covered with a broad flat cape having a parapet or palisado in front lanchester has four of those steps or gradations now remaining the interstice between the inward and outward casing of ashlerwork was filled with flat stones in an inclining position run full of lime mixed with small pebbles and rough gravel so that the cement is more impenetrable than the stone itself the angles were obtuse to suit the superstructure of an exploratory turret or to give greater power to the garrison upon an assault in annoying the enemy on their flanks the gradations allowed them not only a power of ascending the wall readily but of lining it several ranks deep those at the top were at liberty to manage their several weapons and engines those below to use the bow and the soldiers engaged during an assault were easily relieved when fatigued or wounded  some of the stations had an entrance on each side defended by a gate but whether with a tower or not it is difficult to ascertain though it may reasonably be conjectured  i apprehend a roman station in britain when in the occupation of its proper people would greatly resemble the following imaginary drawing    at walwick chesters severuss wall falls in upon the middle of the camp on the east and west sides and hadrians vallum falls in with the south side of it severuss wall and ditch being never continued through a station are here as in all the like cases supplied by the north rampart and ditch of the fort and they are both very conspicuous  from this station a military way horsleys brit romans     warburtons val romans    has gone directly west by little chesters to carrvoran it is very visible for the greatest part of the way and paved with large stones in its eastern course it seems to have passed through this station and crossed the river north tyne just below it by a bridge and at the distance of three miles and a half from thence falls in with the great erminstreet way by the country people called watlingstreet in its course between the south and north parts of britain which military way crosses and soon after coincides with another roman way called the devils causeway which enters into scotland near to berwick upon tweed mr warburton says in his opinion this is though contrary to the sentiments both of mr horsley and mr gordon the true course of the roman road called the maiden way which they supposed to have terminated at carrvoran or to have entered scotland by a shorter direction  from walwick chesters to the village of walwick severuss wall and ditch are very observable but hadrians vallum with what belongs to it is more obscure from hence all the way to carrawbrough both the walls and their ditches are very conspicuous and for most part of the way several regular courses of the original facing stone are to be seen in severuss wall the two works keep pretty close together and nearly parallel one to the other the military way is within a chain or two of the wall taking all the works together they are no where in the whole tract more conspicuous and magnificent than they are here at least for so long a space  near towertay there are five or six regular courses of the facing stones of the wall and a little west from thence are large remains of a castellum detached about a yard from the wall the reason of which is not very obvious  there are for a small space heaps of rubbish laying on the north side of hadrians ditch at a place where the ditch passes through some rocks which looks as if stones had been wrought there for the use of the wall there are also in this part of the north agger several breaks as if they had been made for the passage of carriages which i also observed in other parts none such are observable in those places where the military ways are united and both the rubbish upon the north agger and the breaches in it are where severuss military way leaves it to go off to a castellum  the distance between walwick chesters and carrawbrough fort is almost three measured miles and a quarter and in this space there are three visible castella the fourth has either been very near the station at carrawbrough or just fallen in with it  we passed down to  walwickgrange the former residence of the errington family the situation of the house is romantic and retired anthony errington esquire   edward vi william  high sheriff of northumberland      john  now of walwick chesters wallis   here we found a monumental stone having the figure of a woman to the waist surrounded with a wreath the inscription totally obliterated from its laying as a bridgestone over a waterdrain for the passage of cattle to the stable  it is represented in the plate the inscription was communicated to me by mr collier of newcastle and by him extracted from a manuscript at mr erringtons mr horsley reads this inscription thus  xxiii dis manibus ursae sorori juliae conjugi carrioni filio furio germano  the figure on the top of the stone is no doubt one of the women deceased the fourth line is reversed the first letter in the last line is represented as it appeared upon washing the stone it is plainly an f though mr gordon has made va of it and vavrio of the name this person was brother to the party who erected the monument as is intimated by the word germanus   the next plate is the sculpture described by mr wallis as an altar with a female deity supposed by him to be cybele adjoining to which is the figure of a lion raising the head of a man who lays prostrate  the drawing is taken with accuracy this with the others at the grange appear to be merely monumental and we were informed they were found to the east of the camp not far distant from the vallum the sculpture i apprehend was dedicated to the manes of some deceased personage of note the lion is boldly relieved his left foot is placed upon the head of a human figure naked to the waist the hands cast forward in the position of one fallen separated from these by a moulding on the left hand of the stone is a human figure robed to the feet a spear resting on the left arm a small altar at the right knee and in the right hand what seems to be a blazing torch the construction i put upon the whole when i saw it though contrary to the conjectures of others is that it was erected to the memory of one who was slain in battle and that the figure to the left was in the act of incensing and performing the rites and honors of the dead the romans on their monuments expressed particular nations or people by some animal so the lion may denote some noble enemy scotch expeditions are by some authors said to be distinguished by the figure of a boar mr horsley represents this monument somewhat different he makes the lion turning his face from the person on whose head he rests his foot and the standing figure holds a key in his hand  he gives the following thoughts upon it  this is but a coarse though i think a curious sculpture which has never as i know of been published before i first imagined it to have been sepulchral as most of the other inscriptions and sculptures are which belong to this place but if it be the mother of the gods who is here represented or any other principal deity the stone has probably been of a more public nature there is a broken stone with an imperfect sculpture upon it at corbridge which i take to be of the same nature the sculpture before us represents a female seated holding a key in her right hand and i think a thyrsus or hasta in her left and on the other part of the stone a human figure lying along and a lion with one of his paws gently raising up the head the lion respects cybele the mother goddess and the thyrsus and hasta are her common symbols and sometimes the key and i am of opinion that this is the figure of cybele the syrian goddess for as montfaucon observes dea syria was one of the most celebrated names of cybele and she was so called because much or chiefly worshipped in syria the symbols were the same a towered head lions a tympanum thyrsus etc this sculpture then may very probably represent cybele for both the key and the thyrsus were her symbols by one of which was represented the opening of the earth and by the other the producing of wine and as we have an altar at little chesters devoted to her this may still render it more probable and if it be cybele who is here represented the lion that is gently raising up the head of the human figure may signify the revival of man by the spring and produce of the earth or by the wine and fruits it affords the lion does not seem to be in a devouring posture but rather guarding or cherishing in the sculpture at corbridge the reviving figure has not been human but some other animal and the produce of the earth restores and cherishes both man and beast   in the wall of the same barn in which the last described sculpture is now placed is a monumental inscription to which we could not pay so much attention as it required to make it out it being grown full of moss and much obliterated and indeed inscriptions of that class are in general of very little value the following inscriptions are also in the same wall m  avr  ianvar  semeritvs coh v caecili  procvl coh x maefllf  vrsi   in a wall as we approached the house is the effigy of a man on horseback cut in relief weilding a javelin or sword underneath is a monumental inscription defaced beginning in the usual manner d m the inscription as in the plate was transmitted to me by mr collier in mr horsleys work this inscription is different to that given on the plate  xxiv dis manibus m suillus victor vixit annos  the letters d m prove this also to be a sepulchral monument and the figure shows that the deceased belonged to the horse and therefore probably was one of the ala secunda astorum which in the low empire kept garrison at cilurnum as the notitia informs us suillus is among the consular names m suillus rupes was consul in the year  0 according to the fasti cnsulares it is therefore very probable that this name may have been designed for marcus sulus victor the sword in the right hand of the image seems to be of the dacan form in copying both these monuments i was obliged in some things to differ from mr cordons representation they were found as i was told in a field called the oxclose between walwick grange and the chesters  mr horsleys work also contains the following inscriptions found here  xxv jovi optimo maximo  this is a fine altar but the inscription by being exposed to the weather is so defaced that only i o m at the top are legible whereby it appears to have been dedicated to jupiter optimus maximus  xxvi dis manibus sacrum fabiae honoratae fabius honoratus tribunus cohortis primae vangionum et aurelia egleciane fecerunt filiae dulcissimae  this altar was also at the same place but is now deposited in the durham library it has also been published before in mr warburtons map of northumberland i take it to have been erected to the d manes by fabius honoratus and aurelia egleciane the parents of fabia honoratae deceased i suppose the letter e is wanting at the beginning of the sixth line egleane has been of grecian extract  three centurial stones imperfect no       and     xxx cohortis sextae centuria deliviana  this was in the face of the roman wall about a furlong west from towerlaw and near an exploratory turret it is one of those which have been published in the transactions by dr hunter  xxxi cohortis sextae logus suavis posuit  this is built up in the inner wall of the cottage at towerlaw i perceive that it must be the same which was published by dr hunter in the transactions being a small monument erected by the sixth cohort in that loco suavi as the doctor reads and explains it who observed to me also the peculiarity of connecting the o and c together i once suspected that it might be laus suavis the original favors the other reading but i rather incline to mr wards opinion that it is to be read logus suavis both which names occur several times in gruter when the doctor copied this it was with the others in the face of the wall  dr hunter has given more of these inscriptions but mr horsley could not find the originals two of them are thus according to his description coh x ivnrv coh vi  lire m s these must have been erected by the centuries or centurions of the  th and  0th cohorts though the names of them are not complete and therefore uncertain  the doctor has added two more consisting each of a line elivliani and  cvsinio i think there is no doubt but these also must have been the names of centurions the former is the genitive and the latter is the nominative case both which are usual i suppose the first had the centurial mark prefixed to it though then effaced or else overlooked by the doctor and i think his name must have been flavius julianus     at a little distance from the grange is the fragment of a cross with a sheathed sword cut on it as the token of a treaty of peace but to what event it relates is not known  before i quit the chesters i must remark a consular medallion of hadrians found there four inches in circumference with the head in bold relief the legend hadriano aug caesari with a lauriated border or civic garland on the reverse and this legend s p q r optimo principi s c

iron have been observed in the work  we passed over chollerford bridge in our way to hexham walter skirlaw bishop of durham in the   th year of the reign of king richard ii granted a release from

valley various broad canals by its winding course at the conflux of the rivers lays the sweet retirement of netherwarden defended from the northwest by lofty eminences and facing the vale toward the east hallowed to the churchmen as being the retirement of st john of beverley a bishop of hexham in so distant an age as      a little further and opposite to hexham on an eminence stands the church

great antiquity bid called it hangustald by the old english saxons it was named hextolderham and some authors particularly camden say it is the axelodunum of the romans that name implying its high situation by the application of the old british name dunum a hill by hextol a little rivulet so called which washes its western foot richard a prior of hexham who flourished near  00 years ago writes not far from the river tyne southward there stands a town in these days of no great magnitude and thinly inhabited but in times past as the remains of antiquity bear witness very large and stately this place is named hetoldeham from a little rivulet which runs near it etheldreda wife of king egfrid gave it to st wilfrid that it might be created an episcopal see about the year     he built a church here which for its beauty and excellent architecture exceeded all the ministers in england  william of malmsbury writes this was crown land when wilfrid obtained it of queen etheldreda in exchange it was wonderful to see what buildings were erected there with mighty high walls and how they were set out and contrived with diverse turnings in and out by winding stairs all polished and garnished by the curious workmanship of masons and pargetters whom the hope of his liberality had allured from rome so that these buildings carried the show of the romish magnificence and stood very strong struggling with time     most of our antiquaries believe the origin of hexham to be derived from the romans camden says the first cohort of the spaniards had their station here but horsley contradicts camdens name of axelodunum and conjectures it was epiacum placing the cohors prima hispaniorum at burgh on sands in cumberland  in the reign of egfrid king of northumberland a d     it was made an episcopal see by st wilfrid then archbishop of york who through the enthusiastic fervor of etheldrida etheldrida was daughter to anna king of the east angles and was first married to tonberet

humber besides this vast diocese wilfrid had the government of nine abbeys and being ever ready to accept and also to solicit the most extravagant donatives which the ignorant superstition of the age prompted the great ones to bestow he built and adorned in the most sumptuous manner his churches and abbeys employing in those works the most skilful artists he could procure from france and italy his

fingers of whom eddius himself was one but by masons and artists of almost every kind ed c    wilfrids adversity was derived from an aversion the king took against him apprehending the bishop had

incursion of the scots in the reign of edward the first a d      when the priory and part of the cathedral were burnt in the   th year of that reign soon after this devastation an inquisition was taken of the possessions of the church dated at newcastle on tyne july        in which the particulars of the revenue were set forth too tedious to be inserted here and of little consequence to the

the whole at the dissolution was valued at    l   s  d according to dugdale and    l  s  d as it is set forth in speed there were then    religious in the abbey edward tay prior  this church possessed that ignominious privilege called sanctuary till taken away by henry viii in      on which the disqualifying statute fixes an everlasting stigma by enacting that gross offenders against the laws taking sanctuary at the altar or any consecrated place should be out of the protection of churches implying that such pollutions had rendered obnoxious even the most sacred places  the famous tridstol or stool of peace is still preserved here whoever took possession of it was sure of remission the like in beverley this place had the privilege of a sanctuary which was not merely confined to the church but extended a mile four ways stevens cont dugdale ii     and the limits each way marked by a cross heavy penalties were levied on those who dared to violate this sanctuary by seizing on any criminal within the prescribed bounds but if they presumed to take him out of the stool richard of hexham as quoted by stavely hist chapter     the offense was not redeemable by any sum it was esteemed botoless beyond the power of pecuniary amends and the offenders were left to the utmost severity of the church and suffered excommunication in old times the most terrible of punishments pennants tour in scotland part ii   in hexham were two hospitals one for lepers the other for the sick both well endowed  the archbishop of york enjoyed great privileges here to enquire of which a quo warranto was issued in the   st year of the reign of king edward i to show by what authority he claimed to have all capitulas of the crown delivered to his bailiff to be pleaded by justices whom he should assign for that purpose concerning all things arising within his manor of hextoldersham and that all pleas as well of the crown as other pleas be pleaded by his writs and his justices in his said manor to take and have the issues and profits arising thereby and to do and execute by his officers all things pertaining to the office of sheriff and coroner and that no bailiff of the king do enter into the said manor to execute any office and to have the custody of prisoners and make delivery of them at his will and to have market gallows chattels of fugitives and felons condemned in the said manor without leave of the king and his progenitors which things do pertain to the kings crown and dignity  to which the bishop pleaded his claim from ancient time and usage from time immemorial  in consequence of which these privileges of a palatine were confirmed by the king and council in the   th year of the reign of king edward iii hexham had jura regalia confirmed and the right of levying tenths and fifteenths  in the second year of henry the fifths reign hexham was stripped of those privileges as being an asylum of thieves and robbers  the tenants within this manor as subjects of a palatinate were exempt from all other public subsidies than those raised by their palatine  hexham came to the crown under archbishop holgate who exchanged this manor for some abbey lands in the   th year of the reign of henry viii retaining nothing but the special jurisdiction in the   th year of queen elizabeth it was annexed to the county of northumberland and the manor being soon after sold devolved on the late sir walter calverly blackett  the remains of this ancient cathedral bear innumerable marks of magnificence many ancient tombs are here within the quire is the recumbent effigy of an ecclesiastic hooded on a table monument of black marble in relief at the foot a shield with uncommon arms or rather an emblematical device to denote mortality being the resemblance of cross bones the people who keep the doors say it is the tomb of prior richard an historian of the   th century he was some time a monk here and occurs prior a d      the device on the shield if it is presumed to be the tomb of richard will then appear to be the letters ri placed one over the other mr walliss antiquities which i have frequent occasion to quote says these arms are argent a saltier gules and that contiguous to this tomb an helmet is fixed denoting that this personage before he was an ecclesiastic was of some military order he also supposes he was prior here  if it were not for the ample field of imagination and inexhaustable conjectures the employment of antiquaries would be dull indeed  i cannot forbear dissenting from this learned visiter immediately adjoining this tomb stands a shrine in the choir is a beautiful oratory of stone below and wood above most exquisitely carved now converted into a pew near that is the tomb of a religious probably a prior above in a shield are in saxon characters the letters ri these being in many parts of the building are probably the initials of some of the pious benefactors  pennants tour in scotland part ii of woodwork after the ancient form supported on pillars canopied and ornamented with tabernaclework such as in the early ages of the church distinguished the place where the remains of great personages or saints were deposited this is surrounded with stonework having figures in various niches which by reason of the stalls built against them i could not make out at the eastern end of this shrine within is an altar above which are painted the sufferings of our lord on the canopy or roof are the arms on a shield very fresh azure the saltier if it is such or behind the high altar and in other parts of the church i perceived the same arms and also in the walls of the priory from whence i am led to believe this is the tomb of one of the priors a great benefactor to the church and the insignia a cross of the dedicatory st andrew formed of the two first letters of the priors name    the religious of the order of st austin were hooded  i observed under a seat near adjoining two effigies each about    inches high cut in alto relievo in niches on a grit stone in a square hole in a corner of the oratory is an uncouth head of jupiter and in the inside a hare the emblem of watchfulness against a pillar is a ridiculous figure of a barefooted man with a great club perhaps a pilgrim  pennants tour in scotland part ii it in no wise represents a pilgrim he carries no scrip and wears a cap or helmet   the one fig iiii i conceive represents silenus large eared fitting resting his head on his hand his elbow supported on his knee    the other fig i i apprehend is designed for jupiter and near the altar stands a figure of stone about three feet eight inches high supporting himself on a staff on his head something that appears like a helmet or a cap and plume and round his ancles three wreaths or fetters this fig iii i apprehend is the figure of pan it is reasonable to conjecture they have been saved from the ruins when the roman remains in the vaults were obtained some travelers have concluded these were the works of monkish times the effigies are accurately represented in the annexed plates and the reader will from thence determine according to his own judgment  the tomb of umfrevill one of the family of the earls of angus mentioned by camden within the quire is to be seen a tomb of a nobleman of that warlike family umfrevills with his legs across and his escutcheon of arms at his side after which fashion in those days were they only interred who took upon them the cross and were marked with the badge of the cross for sacred warfare to recover the holy land from the mahomedans and turks  camd brit remains in the south aile not much mutilated this family were benefactors to the church of hexham  a little below in the same aile is the tomb of sir robert ogle with the arms of bertram and ogles quartered and an inscription in brass dated   0  these were ancient families in northumberland the ogles owned seven lords and thirty knights of their race having large possessions before the conquest  in the north aile is a monument in the wall of such a form as usually designed at the building of churches for founders or great benefactors but to what personage this belongs is not known no insignia or inscription remaining it is supposed to be the tomb of alfwold king of northumberland who was assassinated at cilchester by sigga a factious lord of his court on the   d of september a d     i measured an effigy which lays near this tomb and found it answering exactly in length the tomb is formed in an aperture made through the wall by an elegant piece of arched work the effigy represents an ecclesiastic with his hood thrown back to his forehead his hands elevated and robed to the feet the folds of the drapery thrown into excellent order easy and elegant  on the screen at the entrance of the quire are some strange monastic paintings vulgarly styled deaths dance a ludicrous representation of the universal influence of that insatiable tyrant over all ranks of men beginning with the fullchested cardinal and triply coronated pope and leading into his mazes the prince and peasant but i am so disgusted with the church paintings i have seen in other places that i had not patience to attend to this defilement of the tabernacle there are some grim and lionlike saints painted in the ailes among whom stands st john of beverley of hideous aspect  in the pavement of the cross aile are several monuments one inscribed hic jacet thomas de devilston and ornamented with a crosier another with a crosier and chalice inscribed johannes dew with the usual legendary prayer in the margin orate per anima etc  in a part behind the north door is the recumbent effigy of a knight which mr wallis says represents henry beaufort duke of somerset taken prisoner and beheaded at hexham by king edward the fourth his shield or bearing a fesse az with three garbs proper i think it improbable this monument was erected for a traitor who died an ignominious death besides it cannot be any of the beaufort family as they quartered the arms of england i rather conceive this was one of the aydens of ayden castle the arms assumed by the edens of the north at this day being greatly similar the male line of the family of aydens of ayden castle was extinct in edward the firsts time and emma the heiress and relict of that family was by him as a royal ward given in marriage to wallis  the interior architecture of this church is highly finished in the mixed gothic order the pillars are clustered supporting gothic arches the members of the archings and the pilasters finely proportioned the quire is roofed with wood covered with lead and the side ailes are arched with stone a double gallery runs round the whole opening with saxon arches each opening is composed of three arches the center circular the side ones pointed of which the workmanship is very fine and the pillars light the principal pillars of this structure in general are rather disproportionate and heavy an error seen in most of the saxon churches  the mercers company in london under the will of richard fishborn esquire about the year    0 founded a lectureship here which they endowed by a purchase of tithes sir walter calverly blackett gave several valuable gifts for the augmentation of the living and many charities have been left for the relief of the poor it is a doubt with me whether these donations to the poor do not induce indigent and impotent persons to crowd a town and in effect encourage idleness had the donors disposed the same sums for instituting and supporting a manufactory the encouragement to industry would have brought with it opulence instead of crowds of mendicants  mr gale and dr stukeley in the year      visited the vaults of this church now used as a private burialplace what will not curiosity attempt they have given two inscriptions discovered there the one containing a new name of a legatus augusti viz q calpurnius concessinius and that of a body of horse at corchester called equites caesarienses or caesariani coronotatae not mentioned either in the notitia imperii or elsewhere the other of lucius septimus severus by them said to be of the best sculpture the letters large but the inscription imperfect the curiosity remarked by these antiquaries consists in this monument having so distinctly the name of that emperor and its being the only genuine one found so near the wall with his name on it  mr horsley gives the first of these inscriptions in the following manner leg a  q calpvrnvs concessini us praef eq caesa oori onototar vm manvpr aesentissimi nvminvs devs legato augustati propraetore quintus calpurnius concessinius praefectus equitum caesariensium coronototarum manu praesentissimi numinis dei votum solvit  to this reading he adds the following remarks  the rev mr andrews of hexham obliged a friend of mine with a copy of the same inscriptions which he had taken this inscription is upon a roman altar i had leave to descend into the vault and view the inscriptions i spent some time in examining every particular and have here represented them as i found them with the greatest impartiality every word and letter that remains in this is so plain as to leave no room for any doubt the not taking notice that the altar and inscription are both of them imperfect at the top is the only material defect in the former representation i look upon it as certain that the letters which have filled up the deficient part of the line have been vg pr pr for thus the number of letters in this line will answer to the number in the others i think also there have been two or three lines above which are broken off these have probably contained the name of the legate and of the god to whom the altar had been inscribed the conjectures in the letters in mr gordons appendix are very ingenious and the arguments used in support of them very learned and curious the author supposes that here is the name of a new legate as also of a new body of horse called equites caesarienses or caesariani corionototae the name equites caesarienses is there justified by a parallel instance in gruter and the name corionototae that gentleman supposes to be a corruption of the roman name of a people in these parts perhaps curia or coria otodinor and that corbridge was the place the rest of the inscription he judiciously explains to be a flattering acknowledgment of this person that he was promoted by the immediate hand of the emperor it being no new thing to call the emperors gods and erect altars to them but in a matter so entirely conjectural it is very excusable to suspend ones assent and the more explanations are offered it is the more probable that the truth will be found out if q calpurnius concessinius was the imperial legate i scarce think that he would in the same inscription style himself prefect of horse i rather believe as i hinted before that the name of the legate has been above and is broken off perhaps it has been sub legato augustali or pro saluti legati augustalis as to the word corionototarum extract of a letter from sir john clerk to r gale esquire  as to your inscription from hexham it is evident the artificer has been very unsuccessful and that his chisel has stammered into more syllabus than were necessary in the word corionototarum i humbly think it ought to have been coriatarum and that the people of corchester were called coriatae as the spartans of old were called spartiatae or spartietas much used by herodotus   i rather suppose that ptolemys coria or curia was a town of the gadeni than of the otadini ptolemys coritani are a people of one of the provinciae caesarienses in britain and possibly from hence these horse might have the name of caesarienses coritani coriotiotar in the anonymous ravenuas is not unlike this name i suppose it may have been mistaken by some transcriber for coriotiotae or corionototae the shape of the gothic e is not unfavourale to this but it seems more probable to me that it was from some more distant country than any part of britain that these troops had the name of caesarienses corionototae or caesarienses corionototarum the crotoniatae inhabitants of croton a city in greece are celebrated by strabo according to whom the last of these was equal to the first of the other greeks possibly this name may have been designed for crotoniatarum if this be admitted we may more easily account for the greek inscriptions at corbridge and lanchester and for the more evidences of grecian auxiliaries that appear in the neighborhood the explication of the rest of the inscription by the same learned gentleman whom i mentioned above is certainly just that praesentissimum numen dei signifies the emperor and manu intimates that q calpurnius was advanced to his post by the immediate from the manuscripts of the late roger gale esquire hand of this emperor supposed to be commodus who least deserved such titles and yet most insisted on them i find numini praesenti in an inscription to caracalla the word praesenti seems to be used in a different sense in these cases from that of horace praesenti tibi maturos largimur honores jurandasque tuum per numen ponimus aras   and again in his ode concerning regulus  praesens divus habebitur augustus adjectis britannis imperio   to what particular emperor this inscription must be referred is hard to determine with certainty  our curiosity urged us at the distance of    years after those learned visiters had inspected the vaults to see the antiquities they mention perhaps they had entered into open cells then unused for sepulture our descent was more solemn these vaults have for several years past been used as a private burialplace and the entrance is covered with a table of marble of prodigious size which is not usually moved but at the denunciation of mortality the massive claustrum was heaved from the mouth of the vault by iron crows and rollers at which the ground trembled over the arches  by a ladder we descended about  0 feet into the regions of the dead where avaricious curiosity making an anxious research after the objects of its desire so completely occupied the mind that scarce one reflection was agitated for those over whose ashes we wantonly trampled these vaults which anciently were within the west end of the cross have been built of the stones of a roman station many cornices mouldings and ornaments with fragments of inscriptions are scattered through the walls we found the preceding inscription correspond exactly with the plate in mr horsleys works the narrow vault on the left hand is roofed over with flat stones on the furthest of which the following inscription is preserved but from its situation and the stone being reversed rendered difficult to be read my companion and i took it with great attention both in the letters as reversed and as well as we could see them direct our copies exactly corresponded with each other and yet they differ from mr horsleys in whose plates it is thus represented imp caes l sep  pertaxet imp c  avrantonin  vsii   hort vexillation  fe  rvnt imperator caesar lucius septimius pertinax et imperator caesar marcus aurelius antoninus pius felix augustus et geta caesar cohortium vexillationes fecerunt  to this reading he adds there can be no great doubt with relation to the former part of it which is not unlike the inscription at burgh in richmondshire a copy of which was long ago published by mr camden and runs thus imperatori caesari marco antonino pio aurelio felici augusto etc then follows a space where the name of geta has been erased just so in this inscription at hexham after much the same names and titles given to severus and caracalla there follows a small space where it is manifest the words have been designedly erased with a tool i suppose the vexillatio legionis was made up of the several vexillations of the particular cohorts and perhaps they might retain the name of vexillationes cohortium when the vexillations of all the cohorts of the legion that is the whole vexillation of the legion itself was not present these then might be the vexillations of some cohorts of one of the legions which were employed in building the wall that might be occasionally at hexham and erect this inscription some of the inscription facing the right hand is covered in the wall on which the inscribed stone rests the lower part of the stone is also fixed in the end wall of one of the passages into the vault but not so as to hinder the lowest line from being read though not without difficulty the letters fe  rvnt are distinct and certain and as much room is between the e and r as will contain ce so that beyond all question it has been fecerunt which compleats the inscription the stone has had a raised bordering which was spoiled and made level with the rest of the stone when it was built up in this place  it is with the utmost diffidence i offer to the public remarks upon this inscription where they do not agree with the very learned antiquaries who before copied it the beginning of the inscription seems to be imp caes sev  but the line is imperfect and broken off i could not discover the l in this line the second line appeared to be veron axel impo and the beginning of the third line an aa mixed  an inscription in the cottonian collection found at bows in yorkshire mentions the vettones as follows virivs lvpvs leg avg pr pr propraetor under severus balinevm vi ignis exvst vm coh i thr acvm rest itvit cvran te val fron tone praef eq alae vetto    these people were sometimes styled verones and at other times vettones verones a people of spain so called from the river which washed their borders sil       sed alii codd habent vettones  vettones bordering on celtiberia sil        ainsworth camden says a cohort of spaniards were stationed at hexham the inscription by having one side lodged in the wall may now appear with a great diminution i would not have offered my observations but that they may induce some future visiter to reconcile these differences i own it difficult to give a reasonable conjecture how the names of severus and antoninus could be mixed in this inscription s imp a d     a         before i quit the subject of these inscriptions i must add that mr horsley says these stones and inscriptions argue hexham to have been a roman station for the plenty of free stone so near makes it improbable that in the modern buildings or those later than roman they would have fetched any stones either from the roman wall or from corbridge and this might have been a town in the roman times and yet not be mentioned in the itinerary nor continue so late as till the writing of the notitia i know not what name to give it unless we suppose it to have been ptolemys epiacum the situation of this does by no means answer but it is plain from vinovium and galatum that ptolemy is here in confusion and the mutual distances between these three places are not so far wrong as their situation  i have elsewhere proved that it is not axelodunum though it has long been possessed of that name  at the west end of the church are the remains of the priory it was a spacious building with an adjoining cloister the refectory is yet entire and serves as a room of entertainment at public times is very spacious with a roof of oak work what remains of the cloisters shows they were of excellent workmanship the tabernacle work and pilasters above the seats are elegant the door case opposite which formerly was an entrance into the church is richly wrought with pierced work of fruit and foliage in a style easy and bold  the town of hexham was burnt by the scots in the year      together with the priory the west end of the church and schoolhouse  it was pillaged by david king of scots in the  0th year of the reign of king edward iii a d      who entered the borders with  0000 men making their way by lanercost priory and nawarth castle in cumberland on which incursion they were over thrown at nevils cross near durham and david was taken prisoner jo copeland took david bruce king of scotland prisoner in the battle at nevils cross for which he was rewarded with knighthood and  00 l per annum he was sheriff of northumberland    king edward iii  note the sheriffs of this county never accounted in the exchequer until   king edward vi  englands worthies   this place is not very populous the inhabitants being computed at  000 souls the streets are narrow and ill built the marketplace near the center of the town is a spacious square in which is a convenient piazza for the butchermeat the stalls being moveable the town is supplied by a fluent fountain of water in the marketplace two markets are held here in the week on thursday and saturday and there are two annual fairs  leading to the priory is a gateway of very ancient architecture the arches form a semicircle and are molded in a style which denotes their antiquity to be much greater than any part of the priory or cathedral there is nothing similar to this work in proportion of members about the church or any thing in hexham i could discover that appeared cotemporary the roof of the gateway is of ribbed arching meeting in the center the interstices filled with thin stones or bricks such as are seen in roman works the passage is divided into a large gateway for horsemen or carriages and a narrow one for foot passengers the superstructure is in ruins mr pennant says this gate is of the old saxon architecture and perhaps part of the labors of the great wilfrid  there are two ancient towers in the town the one used as a court or sessions house anciently an exploratory tower belonging to the bishops and priors of hexham the other situated on the top of the hill toward the tyne of remarkable architecture being square containing very small apertures to admit the light and having a course of corbels projecting a long way from the top which seem to have supported a hanging gallery and bespeak the tower at present not near its original height the founders of these places are not known camden says he heard they appertained to the archbishop of york this lastmentioned tower having two dreadful dungeons within it doubtless has been the chief fortress of the place and was used as a prison when the bishops of hexham possessed their palatine jurisdiction  in one of the chambers remaining in this tower is the inscription on the plate mr bailey who was my companion was informed of it on a late visit to hexham and did me the favor to communicate it he describes it as cut with a knife on the oak lintle of the chimney which remains rough and uneven the room is of a considerable size but appears to have had no windows or any lights but what was received through loopholes in the walls the jailer now uses the apartment for a hayloft the inscription seems to be the labor of some scotch prisoner and by the character is of no very distant antiquity by the two letters at the beginning of the inscription i apprehend it was done in the reign of one of the jamess and give it the greatest antiquity under the scotch royal line of that name it will only carry it to the beginning of the   th century notwithstanding i am obliged to confess i do not understand it i thought it necessary to insert it and shall be obliged to the reader for an explanation which may appear in some future edition of this work  this place has owned several learned men john de hexham and richard de hexham both superiors of this religious house and great historians the addenda to the book of symeon of durham from the  th of king henry ii to the  st of king richard we owe to prior john richard was the author of a chronicle from adam to henry the emperor he wrote the histories of king stephen and king henry iii but the principal work we have from his hands is a account of the state and bishops of the church of hexham  there is a school here founded by queen elizabeth   th june      with an ample stipend for a master and usher the masters house was built by subscription in      a small pamphlet was published by mr ritschel minister of hexham containing an account of the charities and benefactors to the churches poor and free schools in tyndale ward to which is added a brief account and description of the parish and parish church of hexham with an abstract of queen elizabeths patent for the free school and the statutes thereof   in the marketplace on the front of an old house are three coats of armor in plaisterwork opinions are various what they denominate the most probable is that the dexter arms is that of the dean and chapter of york the center the cross of st andrew to whom the church was dedicated and the sinister one being one of the arm cantantia or rebusses anciently adopted comprehends the name of some great churchman beneath these is a legend divided into three portions which i read ma  ne  ria  perhaps importing the manor house and probably was the mansion of some of the bishops of york plate fig iii  this town is not incorporated but being a manor of the late sir walter c blackett is governed by a bailiff and jury  hexham has been unhappy in civil bloodshed the slaughter made by the north riding yorkshire militia on the miners in their insurrection is remembered with horror no troops in the world could have stood with greater steadiness and military propriety than they did sustaining the insults of an enraged crew of subterranean savages whilst the timorous magistrates delayed their command for defense till the arms of the soldiers were seized by the insurgents and turned on themselves and an officer mr joseph heart a native of darlington was shot at the head of his company as he was remonstrating to the mob  in the levels beneath hexham the decisive battle was fought in      in fullers church history we have these unhappy conflicts reduced into the

you what you mention in your last to me out of the alienation office as soon as i can and transmit it to you among the books you tell me you are master of i find doomsday to be one pray let me know what it is you have of that for i cannot think it is an entire copy of what is lodged in the exchequer though i could heartily with it were as also what you call bedes albinus anglus for i do not remember any thing among bedes works under that title the ms volume of leland in my study touches a little upon the north riding of yorkshire but i fear will be of little service to you he treats of gain in another of the printed volumes but what he gives you of it is there also very thin and trivial i have ordered a copy of my esa to be transcribed here by the printed one with some corrections i have made to it and shall send it you by the next return of mr ping and hope it may be of some service to you you will find in it that i have taken notice of five great ways instead of four according to the general account of our historians who only copied from one another and have pointed out their several courses more exactly than has been done by any body else the reason they have given you an account but of four i take to be their notion that there were no more of them which can cross the island from sea to sea and that i believe is true but that there were others in great numbers is unquestionable the great way you mention that comes from dunbritton frith to rochester in norand falls into or may be a continuation of the ermin street which you will find in the essay i have traced from arundell in suffex to gatherley moor in your neighborhood and there followed two branches of it one to carlile and the other to tynmouth but i was wholly ignorant of this third discovered since by you i shall not here give you the reasons why this is the erminstreet but refer you to the essay for them and in the mean time only further add that the watling street is the truliest described by higden of any of them but it did not terminate at cardigan as he says but at west chester and that the course of it is very visible almost every where that he mentions it and that i have myself one time or other traveled upon the greatest part of it and found it seldom or never loses its name i fancy the country people calling that which you suspect to be the watlingstreet in northumberland by that name has been the chief motive for your opinion but i could give you several instances of old ways sometimes called watlingstreet and sometimes the fosse way by the vulgar in counties where it is certain those ways never came so that nothing is to be built upon that  antoninuss second journey indeed takes in the whole length of it but not till it falls into it at deva or chester the roman station at ethelburgh is taken notice of by camden who makes it more than probable from an inscription there dug up that it was called bruchium to confirm this opinion i will give you a conjecture of mine taken from the monasticon anglicanum vol i p     where in an old deed this very place is named enthelbert as i believe from enchelberi the word enchel in welsh signifying an arm brachium the very name in latin and british thus corresponding besides i cannot but be of opinion that brementonacis was at overborough on the edge of lancashire it lying in the direct way between gallacum whellop castle and coccium ribblechester from which latter place it keeps the just distance allotted it by antoninus and though the copies of that itinerary place it    from the former instead of    miles upon a little consideration you will find the mistake might be easily occasioned by the transcribers turning the third x into v i do not know whether you have seen the edition of antoninus published by me some years ago if you have not my brother at scruton can lend it you it may perhaps be diverting to you though i must own i have since the publication of it found reason to make several alterations in it as i have done upon my own book that i have here by me and among others i must acknowledge it that your map has fully convinced me that glanoventa and gallana in the tenth itinerary are at thornton and portgate and not where my unacquaintedness with the country had induced me to place them but alone i take to be whitley castle in alondale as well from the better agreement of the miles as from an inscription there left by the cohors tertia nerviorum which the notitia imperii quarters at alone i am pretty much of your mind that the military way from easingwould to thirst came from york toward caturactonium or rather into that which went from caturactonium toward gatherley moor because i am very much mistaken if there is not a military way running along the northern bank of swale from catterick bridge eastward toward bolton now i take the course of this road to have gone by thornton in the street to thornbrough and by romandby near northallerton which i doubt not has been a roman station by the name of it and you will find great works cast up about the castle hills there which are very evidently far larger and beyond the confines of the modern castle i have also been told of a roman way some where about romandby though i could never well understand where it was to this i shall add that i hardly ever met with a place named thornbrough or thornton that was not near some old station such a one you have by catterick another called thornton and thornaldby near ethelbury thornton where glanoventa stood in northumberland thornbrough near nostrefield moor and just by the via vicinalis that led from ethelbury over that moor into leeminglane part of the erminstreet and not far from well where any of the inhabitants can show you a roman telated pavement having made so much use of this word i shall only add that these towns take not their names as most people imagine from thorns that might grow there but from the saxon thorn i e turris a plain indication of their having found some such building hereabouts but which way it went from romandby till it came where i told you above upon the very edge of swale i must leave to your discovery neither can i so much as guess what might be the roman name of the station near northallerton but these have brought into my mind what i had like to have passed over and that is the derivation of the name glanenta which assuredly comes from the british or welsh glenwent i e ripa ventae the bank of the river went or wentsbeck the works upon nostrefield moor consisted of a square intrenchment as i remember and a small round intrenchment with two entrances into it one on the southwest and the other on the northeast side of it but what is most remarkable is the ditch or graft which is within the agger it es   0 or  00 paces to the north of the square one just by the road side if i do not forget there were three or four tumult thrown up within the square one and six or seven more over the hedge of the field that lies on the west side of it the military way or via vicinalis mentioned on the other side to come from ethelbury runs very near these intrenchments and falls into leeminglane not far from wath and i think another ancient way seems to cross the road between exelby and cathorp toward the same line i am afraid antiquities are not so much in vogue at court as to obtain that reception for your altar there as it really merits and perhaps after all the trouble and charge you may be at in sending it thither his majesty may never see it or be so much as acquainted with your dutiful intentions i do not mention this to discourage you but only that you should not meet with too great a disappointment if you meet not with the returns you may expect for it i should be glad to know what mr wanley offered you for it for though the altar is so very beautiful and entire as you represent it yet the inscription contains little or no instruction it being to be read as i take it fortunae pop rom caius julius rationalis legionis sextae virtricis vocit i have indeed some doubt as to the letters rat having seen at durham an altar dedicated to fortune whereon the initial letters of the word prafectus were wrote raef the p and r being both included in the first or same letter i desire you therefore to look a little closer upon your inscription when you have an opportunity to see if you cannot trace the initials of praefectus it being much more usual for the commanding officers of legions to erect altars than their accomptants and indeed i do not remember i ever met with the rationalis of a legion in an inscription before but this will make yours the more valuable if it appears to be undoubtedly rat for rationalis pray let me know also the name of the place where you got it dug up  i am yours etc r gale   extract of a letter from mr john warburton to roger gale esquire about some of the roman roads   st november      i have read your essay printed in the  th vol of leland itinerary published by mr heare at oxford     p    toward recovery of the four great roman ways over and over with greater pleasure than i ever read any thing in my life i am fully convinced that the courses you have taken for those ancient roads are perfectly right excepting that you loose the stem of the erminstreet upon gatherley moor and follow only two branches of it that go directly to tinmonth and boulnesse the two extremes of the picts wall whilst the main street proceeds northward almost in a straight line and an uninterrupted ridge from piercebridge close by a small village called denton where there are many remains of antiquity and from thence continues its course by bolham houghton st helens auckland and soon after crosses the wear to binchester vinovium where are to be seen the vestigia of a roman fort several broken altars in the possession of farrer wren esquire the lord of the soil and a great number of roman coins dug up there from this place its course is generally over moorish grounds to langchester where most of those altars and inscriptions in durham library were found see philos transactions no     and at six miles further to ebchester where it crosses the river derwent and enters northumberland from which place my map will show its course into scotland  but before i leave ebchester which is inferior to no place i have mentioned for antiquities i cannot but acquaint you that i look upon it to have been the vindomora of antoninus and not walls end where that station has hitherto been fixed since it exactly answers the distances between corstopitum and vinovium the second and fourth stations in the first iter viz nine miles from the first of them and nineteen from the latter and this in a direct line along one of the most entire regular and large ways i ever saw the ridge being for the most part two yards in height full eight yards broad and all paved with stone that it is at present as even as if new laid whereas from corstopitum or corbridge to walls end the third station in the first iter it is twenty miles directly east and from thence back to vinovium the fourth station twentyfive miles to the westward so that we are carried eighteen miles about along a road that has no appearance of a military way except just where it touches the picts wall and has the river tyne to pass in a part where it never could be crossed without boats which are difficulties i think the romans would never subject themselves to  i have your edition of antoninus which i frequently read and value beyond any thing of that nature but cannot yet absolutely agree with you in placing alone at whitley castle not but that it appears plainly to have been a roman station from the greatness of its ruins and it having the roman road called the maiden way running through its center and from the inscription left by the cohors tertia neeciorum that mr camden gives us it is not to be doubted that they were quartered thereabouts but when i consider that the distance which the itinerary gives betwixt gallana portgate and alone if at whitley castle is but twelve miles and the real distance is twenty and on the other hand that old town in alondale exactly answers the distance allotted it by antoninus has a portway seven yards broad all paved with stone ranging between them its situation on an eminence on the very brink of the river alon and of a square figure entrenched and if we may give credit to the author of the additions to camdens britannia has produced several roman antiquities i am persuaded that station is to be placed here besides i begin to think myself wrong in joining this roman road which i am speaking of with that called the maiden way at whitley castle and am partly of opinion that it did not go so far west but rather struck over by the head of the river teys to ethelburgh in yorkshire and from thence went by coccuim to mancunium and that whelp castle and overburrough if roman stations are either in the military way that comes from ambleside toward kendale which perhaps unites with it at coccium ribblechester or on that called the maiden way which goes by whitley castle this opinion is very much strengthened by a new discovered military way of the very same dimensions and work with that on which glanoventa stands and galana and which runs from ethelburgh full north over a moor called windgate and at a small village called crackpot crosses the river swale and soon after enters another named feetham where i must leave it at present on account of the season at my parting with it it seemed to point at barnard castle see mr warburtons map of yorkshire which shows it to have gone northward to barnard castle and to overburrough southwestward and if so probably stratford near that place was where it crossed the river tees both on account of its name and being in a direct line to old town in alondale where i have chose to place alone as a further proof of old towns being alone it may not be improper to acquaint you that mr camden is wrong in placing whitley castle upon the river alo for it is six miles distant from any part of it there is indeed about a mile from it a small stream called yal which empties itself into tynt but i think this argues but little for it neither can i believe that the inscription left by the cobors iii nerviorum is a certain proof of its being alone for i have often observed altars set up by one and the same cohors in places several miles distant as for instance at the housesteads where i place bor at willeford and other places along the picts wall i find altars erected by the cohors i tungrerum and as old town on the river alon in alondule is but eight miles distant from whitley castle i do not see but they may have both been the habitation of the cohors iii nerticrum  the military way that comes from esingwold to thoraldby shows itself very plainly in the village of romandby from which place it goes to yafford langton bolton upon swale brunton and by the north side of the friery wall in richmond to the top of richmond moor where i loose it but believe it shoots north west and meets with that which goes north from ethelburgh some where about barnard castle this roman read comes from br upon hamer perhaps the praetorium of antoninus to delgoitio wigton de cu adby and so to easi wa thi rom bolton upon swale the north end of catterick bridge and so to richmond etc  r g   the observation you make upon such places as bear the name of thornton the observation above mentioned  such tow have the word thorn in their names as thornton townbgh are not so called from the word thorn  but from the saxon thorn terris castellum and are generally seated near some old roman station as thornugh near catterick bridge and another near roman thy near oldbury in gloucestershire the projectors of antoninus thorntonrust not far from ethelburgh etc  r g is very good and daily proves serviceable to me i have traced the roman way that comes from ethelburgh into leeminglane and find that it passes through thornton asgarth bolton park middleham to ulshawbridge where it crosses the ure and continues its course by danby thorntonsteward watlass church and over wa moor where there are several tumuli of different sizes to the west side of causick part thence it goes by thornbrough to middletonquernhow and enters leeming lane about half a mile southeast of the last place  bedal   st november      j warburton   extract of a letter from roger gale esquire to mr warburton in answer to the preceding letter sir i have been long indebted to you for your most entertaining letter of the   st of november which should not have laid so long unanswered but that your being upon the road i very well knew would give you no time to peruse what i might write to you if it did come to your hands what you say of your transcript of domsday i believe is very right the lesse doemsday in the exchequer containing only the description of essex norfolk and susfk norfolk you seem to have again in your second volume with richmond which i believe has been transcribed from a most curious and valuable manuscript in the cottonian library called regifirum hnoris de richmond where you have not only this extract from doomsday but several charters inquisitions quo warrantos and other ancient deeds relating to that country when you write next pray let me know if your copy have any thing more in it than what belongs to richmondshire albinus or as others will have his name alcuinus composed a poem de  et sanctis ecclesiae eboracensis all which is taken from bedes history but h w his name came to be prefixed to your bid if it is bid i cannot imagine you must not think it strange if my essay upon the roman ways is not complete i only call it an essay some parts of those roads i have occasionally observed in my travels others and as i must acknowledge by far the greatest part i have only traveled in maps or picked out of authors as i was upon other subjects so that it is no wonder if i cannot help omitting large tracts of them in some places and leaving them short in others as i have done in the middle branch of that on gatherley moor which i believe you we now satisfied is the erinstreet as that i was ehchester is vindemora upon my first fight of your excellent map of northumberland which likewise obliged me to change my opinion as to the situation of glanoventa which my addition of antoninus had placed upon the river bowent in glendale for though the distances between glanoventa and gallava thornton and portgate do not exactly agree with the numbers in that itinerary yet they are not so wide as the number of miles between anterchester upon bowent and portgate which is thirtyfour but if we six glaoa at thornton gallava at walwick as i have done in antoninus and alone at old town all these distances will agree pretty well with the itinerary another argument for glanoveas being placed at thornton may be deduced from the name itself you very well know that wentsheck the name of the little river upon or near which thornton is situated is the same thing as wentsluviolus glen or glan in british is ripa so that gl went glta is ripa wentae a town upon the bank of went the notiti imperii also places glabeam ad lineam valli which though not strictly true is much nearer the truth at thornton than at anterchester as i remember in my last letter to you i did not found my conjecture of alona being at whitley castle so much upon the inscription found there as upon the due distance it would then obtain in respect to brementonacis and only made the inscription a concurrent argument now as the distance between walwick and old town holds as good as that other between whitley castle and overburrough bretois so the argument is equally strong for alone being at old town and i really give up my former opinion to you as the rightest i should have mentioned galacum whellp castle as lying between alone and bremetnacis or brementonacis as some copies have it the distance allotted it by antoninus is nineteen miles from alone which also agrees better with old town than whitley castle but the distance between whellop castle in that itinerary and brementoncis agrees well with neither overburrough nor ethelburrough the former being thirtytwo and the latter but twentyfour miles instead of twentyseven however i was and am still inclined to fix it at the former it lying more directly in the road to coccium ribblechester the distance agreeing better being about twentytwo whereas it is thirtysix miles betwixt rehelburgh and ribblechester and as for the thirtytwo between it and gallacum the mistake may have easily been committed by a transcribers making an x for a v if you turn the third x in    to v the numbers will be    and correspond to those of antoninus however i shall suspend giving up myself entirely to my opinion till i hear whether you find reason to alter yours about this roman roads joining with the maiden way at whitley castle or that it came by the head of teys to ethelburgh and from thence to coceium the latter part i believe you will hardly prove to do so because i am pretty certain you will trace it from ethelburgh over nostrefield moor into leeminglane except two ways lead from it and then perhaps one of them might lead to coccium this way you say goes directly by its pointing upon barnard castle to old town now if we could discover any station that might prove to be gallacum upon it between old town and ethelburgh at a due distance from them both according to the itinerary it would put the matter out of dispute but i cannot think of any such and if it passed the teys at statford as there seems to be no great doubt it did it points a little too much eastward for alone old town and rather inclines to fall into the great roman road at or near to vinonium binchester i have been very long upon this subject therefore shall only add that the miles i reckon by are shorter than those you make your computation from for as antoninus is my chief guide i make an allowance for the difference between the roman and english mie which is as     to  000 i do not know whether i mentioned the roman road from romanby etc running by bolton on the north side of swale to you but i find you have observed it if you have leisure at any time when you are at northallerton to view the castle hills there between that town and romanby you will find great works and trenches out of the limits and beyond the ditch of the modern castle westward and southward which i dare say were roman and gave name to the neighboring village though what was the ancient appellation of it is now entirely lost as for the name of allerton it is very hard to tell whence it came the saxon kings generally built on or near the ruins of ancient and decayed roman towns and as we have no memorials that contradict my conjecture i am apt to think this town might be built here by king alfred who restored many places that had been destroyed by the danes or else by guthrum the dane to whom upon his being baptized he gave all the kingdom on the north side of watlingstreet who might call it alvertun or alsreton for that is the ancientest name it occurs by in honor of his godfather and benefactor this i think is more probable than that it should be so called from aller trees as some have facied since the ancient writing of the name makes for it  i am much obliged to you for your kind offer of your coins but i am unwilling to rob you of them having most of them already as for the altar found at elsdon i should be very thankful for that and desire you when opportunity serves to get it conveyed to scruton where i hope to see it next summer but the carriage must be at my charge the circumstances of your finding the altar at chester in the wood are very odd i cannot suppose that vault to have been the place where the altar was primarily erected and used since they only sacrificed under ground to the infernal gods and fortune was not one of them it seems most probably to have been concealed there by the romans or roman britons when they were drove from those stations by the pcts to prevent its profanation by those barbarous enemies and that other which accompanied it may have been accidentally broken in the burying but then as to the smoaky smell it will be a little difficult to form any conjecture i was once at crencester in clocestershire shown the top of much such a vault as you describe in a garden there but the ground all over and about it being sown i could not persuade the gardener to give me admittance into it but he assured me it was filled near three feet deep with burnt bones and ashes this made me conclude some altar might have stood near it and that this vault was the receptacle of what was swept from the altar and why may not the vault at chester in the wood have been for the same purpose and thence contracted its smell i think you were much in the right not to part with it and the rest to the lord you mention upon general promises i dare say all the gratification you would have had from him would have been the honor done you of erecting marble pedestals to set them on  i am sir your etc r gale      allendale town is situate on an eminence on east allen is chiefly inhabited by miners in

of branches cut from the wood in the neighborhood of their last encampment and which casting before them into the broken parts of the bog as they advanced through it they led their horses over those

by his mother from the noble barons of monfitchet  camdens brit it is now the estate of george baker esquire of ellemore in the county of durham  we passed from blanchland by a woody declivity to acton mill a smelting mill for lead where in vast heaps of ore the wealth of the late sir walter caverley blackett was displayed the road from thence to prudhoe was harrowed up by lead carriages and in innumerable places the name of blackett struck our eye on the lead which lay on the road we passed by  minster acres where the advances of cultivation gives a most pleasing countenance to the decreasing desert  the country in general is heathy and naked near these new and beautiful enclosures where planting succeeds admirably  at length we gained a distant view of tynedale colored with the happy teints of corn and meadow we hastened from the dreary country which had detained us too long from scenes of pleasure  when we had gained the summit of the hill above hedley we had a good prospect of tyne toward the northwest the river by its winding course formed seven distinct canals one of them near a mile in length the foreground of this landscape is enriched with the village of bywell surmounted by mr fenwicks elegant mansion and decorated with plantations and garden grounds so disposed to the eye as to retain all the ease and inartificiality of nature the water brightened by a western sun appeared through the trees as if the mansion and pleasure grounds were insulated the rising ground to the right is crowned with a gloomy ruin once the fortress of the vale held by the baliols and after them by the earls of westmoreland now contrasting beautifully with the modern and excellent taste of mr pain of whose mode of architecture the mansion house of bywell is constructed to the left extensive woods filled the landscape  behind the town of bywell grounds in high cultivation interspersed with wood ascend gradually from the river in one part terminated by heathy eminences and in another by distant lands stretching away through an extended valley toward hexham where the distinction of objects was lost to the eye in the blue vapors which covered the extremity of the vale  we descended through a woody passage to  prudhoe   which though situate on a very lofty eminence near the banks of tyne is much inferior to the hills by which we advanced toward it  the castle of prudhoe stands on the summit of a vast rocky promontary which communicates with the adjoining grounds by a narrow neck and pass toward the south the ground on which the fortress stands forming seven parts of a circle on an octagonal section it is guarded by an outward wall toward the tyne built on the brink of the cliffs in this part not less than sixty perpendicular feet in height above the plain which intervenes between the castle and the river this wall at intervals is defended by square bastions the entrance to the castle is from the south on our approach the whole structure was viewed from the heights and made a very noble and formidable appearance the narrow neck of land leading to the entrance was formerly cut through by a deep ditch over which a draw bridge has given access to the outward gate the water which anciently supplied the ditch is now collected by a reservoir before the gate and serves a mill the outward gate was originally defended by several outworks and a tower as appears by their ruins from the situation in which i drew my view of this place i could overlook the top of the first gate and the eye penetrated the inner gateway the superstructure of which is a lofty embattled square tower about sixty feet high now so mantled with ivy that the windows loopholes and apertures are almost wholly concealed i will describe the whole from the station i occupied on that occasion to the right the outward wall extended to some distance terminated by a turret or exploratory mount the wall of which is embattled and there the landscape was closed by a fine grove of stately trees the outward wall to the left from the inner gateway extends to a considerable distance without any turret or bastion over which several interior buildings and among them the remains of the chapel were discovered in all the confusion of ruin mingled chimneys windows buttresses columns and walls in that wildness of irregularity which constitutes much picturesque beauty in scenes of this kind above all which objects a square tower the keep of the fortress on the side toward me almost perfect twentyfive yards in height and eighteen in breadth but without ornament or windows with an exploratory tower on the southwest corner overlooked the castle with that gloomy and sullen majesty which characterizes the age in which it had its rise the wall still extending to the left on its angle is defended by a square bastion with broken loopholes from whence it turns northward and is terminated by a broken circular tower situate on the brink of the cliff whose inner recess the eye sufficiently penetrated to mark the distraction of its interior works the fine levels between the castle and the river opened to the left the tyne in view with the town of ovingham hanging on the opposite shore in mr groses addenda we have the following survey of prudhoe castle taken the  th of august       there is an old ruinous castle walled about and in form not much unlike to a shield hanging with one point upward situate upon a high moate of earth with ditches in some places all wrought with mans hands as it seems and is of content all the site of with a little garden plat and the banks by estimacon sc     acr  the said castle has the entrey on the south where it has had two gates the uttermost now in decay and without the same is a little turnepyke and on the west part a large gate room where there has been a passage into the lodgings there situate without the castle as is supposed or to the chapel there standing and between the gates is a strong wall there on both sides and as it appears has been a draw bridge and without the same before it come to the utter gate a turnepyke for defense of the bridge the gate is a tower all massy work on both sides to the top of the vault above the vault is the cheppel and above the cheppel a chamber which is called the wardrobe it is covered with lead but in great ruin both in lead and timber it is in length ten yeards and in breadth six yeards or thereabouts  there is opposite to the said gatehouse tower joining to the north wall of the said castle one hall of eighteen yeards in length and nine yeards in breadth or thereabouts within the walls covered also with lead albeit the timber and lead in some decay  between the said gatehouse tower and hall on the left hand at your entrey in at the gate is a house of ijo house height of length xxiiij yeards in breadth   yeards or thereabouts divided into two chambers covered with slate the lower house has a great room to pass out of the court through that house to the great tower and the south end a chamber called the parlour and in the north end a little buttery in the house is two chambers called the utter chamber and inner chamber out of the utter chamber is a passage to the great tower by a little gallery on the other side a passage down to the buttery out of the inner chamber is a passage to the chapel and on the other side a passage to a house called the nursery  on the west part of the said house is another little house standing east and west upon the south wall called the nursery in length ten yeards and in breadth six yeards or thereabouts of two house height covered also with slate  at the southwest corner is a house standing north and south called the garner adjoining to the west wall in length ten yeards in breadth   yeards or thereabouts

round on the outside in length seven yeards or thereabouts covered with lead but in decay both in lead and timber  joined to the said tower is another house of two house height in length nine yeards in breadth six yeards or thereabouts covered with slate but much in decay  in the middle of these houses by itself stands the great tower one way    yeards another way xij yeards north and south of   stories only and of height xv yeards or thereabouts besides the battlements it has no vault of stone in it it is covered with lead but in some decay of lead and timber but necessary to be repaired and a toofall or a little house adjoining thereunto in utter decay  at the east end of the hall is a house called the kitchen of one house height in length xij yeards in breadth six yeards or thereabouts covered with slate  in the east end as it were at the lower point of the shield is a little square tower in length vij yeards in breadth  yeards or thereabouts covered with lead but in utter ruin and decay both in timber and lead  adjoining to the same is a house called the brewhouse in length viij yeards and in breadth vij yeards covered with slate  there is within the scyte and without the walls an elder chapel which has been very fair and covered with slate in the time that diverse dwellers were on the demesnes one dwelled in the said chapel and made it his dwelling house and buyers for his cattle and by that means defaced saving the timber walls and great part of slate remains  there was an orchard set with all fruit trees now all spoiled and an old house wherein the keeper of the orchard did dwell     we advanced by a narrow path on the side of the reservoir to the first gateway which is formed by a circular arch by the fragments and broken walls it evidently appears this gate was originally flanked with various outworks and had a tower this gate gives admittance to a covered way leading to the inner gate about  0 paces in length a sallyport opening on each side to flank the walls and defend the ditch there is no appearance of a portcullice in either gateway the second gateway is also formed by a circular arch above which is a high tower the windows showing that it contained three tiers of apartments a lattice or open gate still remains jointed with studs of iron the roof of the gateway is arched in semicircles with an aperture in the center from whence those in the upper chamber might annoy an enemy who had forced the gate from thence you enter an area now so blocked up by the buildings of a farmyard and tenement that it is not possible to form any idea of its original magnitude though it appears by the other parts that an open area had surrounded the great tower which does not show any remains of communication with the outworks but seems to have stood apart on an eminence in the center the outward wall was defended on the angle to the south west by a large square bastion with loopholes to the northwest by a circular tower containing several tiers of low chambers singular in their form and height and such as i never observed before in any ancient castle the inhabitants could not stand erect in them at the time of defense toward the river and northward the wall is guarded by several small square bastions and toward the southeast a small mount placed within the walls overlooks the ditch which guards the southern side and terminates at the brink of the cliffs the large tower is in ruins only the the southern wall now standing and not one bastion remains entire they being all in ruins toward the area a passage runs in the center of the wall from bastion to bastion steps ascend from the area to the top of the wall in several places which is broad enough to allow the armed men of the garrison to pass each other covered by a parapet  camden conjectures this was the prodolita of the romans and the station of the first band of batavians it was the possession of the umfrevills this family came into england with the conqueror who bestowed on robert with the beard the lordship of redesdale to be held for ever by the service of defending the country against thieves and wolves with the same sword with which william entered northumberland and also the barony of prudhoe by the service of two knights fees and a half dugdales baronage  0  this castle was famous in the reign of king henry ii for the opposition it gave to

married his daughter to one high in the kings favor  in the   th of king john richard de umfrevill delivered up his four sons and his castle of brudhow as pledges for his fidelity notwithstanding which he put himself in arms among the bros in the   th of the same reign the consequence of which was that the castle and lands were given to hugh de baliol but in the reign of henry iii he obtained a restitution but never had the confidence of that king who was offended at and distrusted him on account of his fortifying his castle of harbottle he gave one toft and eight acres of land in the town of prudhow to the monks of hexham his son gilbert succeeded to this barony and dying the  0th of henry iii was succeeded by  gilbert the second who was styled the famous baron the flower and keeper of the northern parts of england  gilbert the third was by king edward i made earl of angus in scotland and under that title summoned to parliament ad      the lawers at first refused to acknowledge him as an earl because angus was not of this kingdom but submitted on sight of the kings writ wherein he was summoned by that title  gilbert the fourth in the   th of edward iii exhibited a petition to the king and his council assembled in parliament setting forth that he and his ancestors time out of mind used to have custody of all prisoners taken within the liberty of reedsdale to be kept in his prison of harbottle castle which being so ruined by the scots wars that it was insufficient to retain them he desired he might have leave to keep all such prisoners in his castle of prudhow till his castle of harbottle could be properly repaired the king being satisfied that the fact alleged in his petition was true and considering that the ruinous state of harbottle castle did not arise from neglect granted him leave to keep such prisoners in his castle of prudhoe for ten years  this earl gilbert died without issue in      having had by his wife maude daughter and heir of thomas lord lucy a son named robert who although he died before his father had been married to margaret daughter of henry the second lord percy of alnwick but without issue it seems to have been in consequence of the settlement made on this marriage that the castle and barony of prudhow descended to the percies for it appears among the pleas in the kings bench    king henry vi and roll   on a traverse then tendered by henry earl of northumberland that john hawborough and john pykeworth ao    king edward iii gave to gilbert hamfervile and to mawde his wife and to their heirs lawfully begotten the said castle and barony and the manor of ovingham and for lack of such issue the said castle manor and barony to remain to henry lord percy and to his heirs for ever  in consequence of this disposition after the death of earl gilbert his widow the countess maude enjoyed it for her life she married to her second husband henry percy first earl of northumberland who after her death entered into full possession of the castle and barony with its appendages and the same continued in his posterity without any other interruption except what was occasioned by the attenders in different periods thus on the forfeiture of the said first earl of northumberland and his son hotspur in the reign of king henry iv the castle and lordship of prudhow were bestowed by the said king   king henry iv on his son john afterward duke of bedford and regent of france who appears to have held them till his death except for a short time viz   henry vi when ralph earl of westmoreland was possessed of the mano of prudhow so again    king henry vi the castle of prudhow was in possession of sir john bertram knt but afterward the whole reverted to the percies till they underwent another attainder for their adherence to the house of lancaster in the  th of king edward iv the castle of prudhow was given to sir william bertram knt in the  th year of that kings reign after the restoration of henry the fourth earl of northumberland this castle and barony were again given back to the percies and though their possession of it suffered again some short interruptions from future attaintures in the reigns of king henry viii and queen elizabeth yet the castle and barony of prudhow have constantly descended with their other great possessions through the succeeding earls of northumberland down to

over the ferryboat at ovingham from whence we had a fine view of the castle of prudhoe the river beneath us washed the margin of a level of corn land above which arose the precipitous cliffs on which the castle is erected in the form of a half moon crowned with the remains of the fortress of an aspect awfully majestic over these the rising grounds behind clothed with woods and the thick groves on each flank seemed to cast a solemn mantle the scene struck me with the image of mourning royalty weeping in ashes for the dissolution of empire and lamenting the cruel vicissitudes of fortune in which all its honors are extinguished and nothing but memorials of calamity left behind  ovingham had heretofore a religious house of black canons subordinate to hexham founded and endowed by one of the umfreviles barons of prudhoe at the dissolution it was valued at   l  s  d by sancroft and   l  s  d by speed it is now the estate of thomas charles big esquire of little benton the church is in the

frontier station of the fourth cohort of the gauls severuss wall runs upon the middle of the east rampart but is not continued through the station hadrians vallum passes about the distance of a chain to the south of it this fort has been very considerable and the ruins of it at present are remarkable on the north side there have been six turrets one at each corner one on each side the gate and one between each corner and those adjoining to the gate on the east and west sides there is also a tower between the gate and the angle in that part of the fort that is on the north of the wall but it is doubtful whether there has been the same number of towers in that part that lays within the wall the ramparts are still very visible if there has been a town without which there can scarce be any doubt of it has been as usual on the south where the village of rutchester now stands and covers its ruins  to the northwest of rutchester is a place called whitchester sometimes outchester in camden it is called old winchester or vindolana and there are said to be some remains of a fort here but all this seems to be a mistake there is somewhat like the remains of an earthen rampart which added to the name may make it probable that here were the castra aestiva of the garrison of rutchester and perhaps it was called the outer chesters  between whitchester and harlow hill is a round hill with a trench about it which seems to have been exploratory and by the situation one would judge it had been as ancient as the time of the romans  it is curious to observe the passage of hadrians ditch near harlow hill where it passes through a limestone quarry though nothing is to be discerned on the surface yet below it the exact dimensions of the ditch may be taken because that part of the quarry through which the ditch has been carried on is now filled up with earth only so that the shape and measure here are very plain it is made sloping the depth between eight and nine feet and about eleven feet broad at this place a castellum has stood the foundations yet appear it has had a high situation and commanded an extensive prospect  at the usual distance from harlow hill a castellum is visible and about a furlong west from this the walls approach very near to each other being not above a chain distance again at the usual distance another castellum appears but somewhat obscure and of an uncommon shape two of the sides those which lay east and west being about double the usual length and the south side of it reaches very near the north agger of hadrians work mr horsley was of opinion this was one of hadrians exploratory castella but the north side of it falling in exactly with the line of severuss wall it has been used also as a castellum by him severuss wall in part of this tract has four courses of the original stone appearing  from rutchester to halton chesters is little more than seven measured miles there are nine castella between these two stations and all of them visible the interval between every two of them being near upon six furlongs and an half and it is remarkable that as the interval between these two stations is the greatest of any upon the whole line of the wall so the intervals between the castella are the least of any except in one single instance  many roman antiquities have been gained here besides those mentioned by mr horsley viz an effigy of hercules some years ago was removed from hence by mr duane two fibulae of silver roman bricks marked lviv and coins of the low empire were lately discovered but the most valuable acquisition gained from hence was an urn found in      containing gold and silver coins in the possession of the late william archdeacon esquire in which it is said is a complete series of those of the higher empire in the same year was discovered a coffin cut in the rock twelve feet in length containing many bones teeth and vertebree or joints supposed to belong to animals sacrificed to hercules whose festival was observed on the third day of june mr horsleys work contains the following inscriptions found here  xiii centuria voconii cohortis posuit  this is a centurial inscription in the usual form the centurions name voconius is visible but the number of the cohort is effaced  xiv cohors nona posuit  this contains the number of the cohort which might probably be one of those that carried on the work of the wall from walbottle hither it is remarkable that though we have all the intermediate numbers from one to ten yet ten is never exceeded on such stones this confirms them to be the numbers of the legionary cohorts  xvii centuria turriai prisci  this was found near this place it appeared at first fight to be plainly centurial and of the usual form but the implication of the letters is very odd part of the letters of both the names being thrown together in the same cipher in which no fewer than four or five letters are united the name priscus is in another centurial inscription at cousins house and two in cumberland     near this station stands rutchester tower the possession of the family de rutchesters in the reign of king edward i the county of northumberland as was before

hitherto has only had my distant view from hedley hill  i cannot forbear taking notice of a public grievance which is so very notorious in the county of northumberland that every traveller experiences it when i entered this county i was prejudiced in its favor and had not the least apprehension that any matter necessary for the public weal could be neglected the resolutions of the magistrates given to the public will transmit their virtues to posterity merchandise has occasioned within the last century such an influx of wealth to this county that it proves trade is advanced by good roads for carriages and an easy communication with the ports  how then in the midst of such professed virtues and such public conviction can it arise that the plain directions of the law touching the highways are totally neglected or overlooked there is scarce one guidepost to mitigate the grievances of traveling erected through the whole county except in the neighborhood of wallington and some of those are obliterated on the public road from newcastle to hexham and on the wilds of wooler the traveller is equally embarrassed  as you look upon bywell from the most pleasing point of view the landscape lays in the following order  from the road near the brink of the river the ruined piers of a bridge become the front objects behind which in a regular cascade the whole river falls over a wear extended from bank to bank in height about eight perpendicular feet a mill on the right hand a salmon lock on the left the town and two churches stretch along the banks of the upper basin of the river with a fine curvature the solemn ruins of the ancient castle of the baliols lift their towers above the trees on the right and make an agreeable contrast with the adjoining mansion house the whole back ground of the landscape appears covered with wood  there is a tradition that two sisters quarrelling about precedence one of them founded a church of her own from whence she excluded her sister which was the occasion of two churches in this small town both are served at present by one clergyman who does duty in the morning at one and in the evening at the other  bywell was the barony of the

 i cannot quit this delightful scene without making a comparison between the era of    0 and the present age  the record i have given in my note affords a deplorable evidence of the circumstances attending the inhabitants of tyne when they were obliged to guard their cattle every night and to cultivate no more lands than in proportion to the places of defense they had to secure their crops living in a state of perpetual warfare and jeopardy and even these calamities which arose from a vicinity of thieves and robbers were trifling when compared to the devastation and ruin which marked the incursions of the scots these were only the incidental grievances of the times but there was one which was continued  the vassalage and misery of a feodal tenure by which genius was kept in fetters and industry was distinguished only by the name of slavery what then was the estate of this opulent and beautiful county of northumberland when compared to the present time what blessings have

vehemence of an enthusiast on his knees before he drinks to the prosperity of the object of his wishes who is perhaps no other than some factious wretch and rebellious disturber of the commonweal whilst the circle of communicants standing around like canibals at some horrid festival or demons at an infernal convocation in every distortion of body and countenance which can express an agitated soul and an inflamed mind halloo with all the ardour of unlimited licentiousness in the hideous yells of hottentots  when such a visiter returned to his native land should relate the scene and tell his astonished countrymen that with the polished britons this was jollity and public spirit could he be believed  would he not like mandeville on his visit to the vale of devils to save his credit be obliged to add men sayen for i hav not seyen as to my part i think a vehement partizan in the ardent act of drinking a constitutional toast as he would term it is as odious and ridiculous an animal as nature can exhibit  returning to the wall  stamfordham claims my attention consisting of one street only it has three annual fairs on the   th of april holy thursday and thursday succeeding the   th of august here is a free school founded by sir thomas widdrington in the year      well endowed the vicarage house is pleasantly situated  about a mile from thence is  fenwick tower now in ruins in a low situation the seat of thomas de fenwick thomas de fenwick king henry iii robert     king edward i john  high sheriff of northumberland    king richard ii sir john fenwick king william iii wallis in the reign of king henry iii it continued for several generations in that family till it came by sale in the reign of king william iii to sir william blacker in pulling down pan of this tower since i visited it a treasure was found by one of the workmen of the broad gold coin of king edward i as fresh as if new from the mintage the poor wretch elate with his success exceeded those limits of discretion necessary to secure his wealth by launching out into extravagance he alarmed an envious neighbor and the simple man was soon left to his original poverty by a claim from the owner of the tower  west matfen in the neighborhood of fenwick tower next attracted our notice in the reigns of king john and king henry iii it was the manor of philip de ulcote who held it by grand sergeancy on keeping the pleas of the crown he was joined in commission with hugh de baliol    king john a d      to hold the castle and town of berwick upon tweed against the barons it afterward became the inheritance of the feltons till by marriage it devolved on sir edward de hastings in the reign of queen elizabeth it was in the possession of sir ra lawson and after changing its owners several times from that period is now the estate of sir edward blacket whose mansion house is seated on a fine eminence shielded by extensive woods above the river pont with a vista of considerable extent opening upon the military road the house and pleasure grounds are highly pleasing though not pompous there is that elegance which perfect neatness constitutes to be discerned in the whole  adjoining to the east side of the vista is a rude stone column nine feet high near which lately stood a tumulus which on account of building a farmhouse has been destroyed the people living near it say it was near  0 yards in circumference at the foot but as no remains were left for me to make my observations upon i will give the description found in mr walliss book verbatim in a field on the east side of the vista about three quarters of a mile from the house is a circular mount with a round cavity in the middle of the form of the celtic tumuli or temples an upright stone pillar standing by it of a great size nine feet high above ground with flat sides three feet broad and a foot and a half thick the mount is composed of earth and numerous masses of stone of the coarse rag kind many of which have been dug up for the use of this farm and among them were discovered two stone chests or coffins consisting of four flags set edgeways with a bottom stone and a stone cover containing the ashes of the dead appearing like a white dust  from this description i apprehend it was one of the most curious pieces of antiquity of the tumuli order that was in this county or perhaps the north of england i humbly conceive it was not a celtic temple as mr wallis calls it being evidently appropriated to the sepulture of the dead a defilement at no time permitted by the druids in their holy places its distant antiquity is proved by the mode of sepulture the burning of the deceased after the manner of the romans was not attended with the mode distinguished herein interment the danes used burning the deceased but we have no evidence in what manner they practiced it in england from the cavity on the crown of the mount similar to some of the druids monuments i have seen i am induced to apprehend this was the mausoleum of the druid tribe and of the remotest antiquity and that such cavity was adapted to rites paid to the manes of the deceased pillars and other memorials of sepulture were originally devised as mementos to the passenger of the precariousness of our existence and by remembrance of the virtues of the dead to promote our emulation the custom of burning the remains of men of rank or power gained an acceptance in very early ages it was consistent with the general ideas of those who held the amonian rites the spirit or human soul was esteemed to be a spark of etherial fire an emanation of the deity who made his throne in the orbit of the sun to which they looked up in worship which divine essence in this life was cased up in members of mortality during a pilgrimage allotted to it in a terrestrial state to restore to that element again this offspring of heavenly light they reduced even the loathsome memorials of its bondage that nothing should remain which might cause it to linger on earth but i will add no further to this subject than by way of note to give the reader the quotations and reflections of mr wallis temples and funeral memorials like this with cepititious or stone altars and an upright pillar untouched by the chisel are the most ancient of any in the world were raised in judea and all over the holy land by the eastern princes and patriarchs by whom they were called bethels and elbethels the manner of consecration was with oil poured on the pillar  one of these pillars was erected by jacob and he called is the house of god jacob rose up early in the morning and took the stone that he had put for his pillow and set it up for a pillar and poured oil upon the top of it and he called the name of that place bethel but the name of that city was called luz at the first and he said this stone which i have set up for a pillar shall be gods house jacob came to luz which is in the land of canaan that is bethel he and all the people that were with him and he built there an altar and called the place elbethel and jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with god even a pillar of stone and he poured a drink offering thereon and he poured oil thereon and jacob called the name of the place where god spoke with him bethel  the making of altars of earth or of natural stone as formed in the earth was by the direction of god to moses an altar of earth thou shall make unto me and if thou will make me an altar of stone thou shall not build it of hewn stone for if thou lift up thy tool upon it thou have polluted it  these temples were generally erected on the higher ground such as were most conspicuous and obvious to fight the one was built by moses and another by joshua on mount ebal composed of whole natural stones or pillars plaistered with plaster whereon they wrote the divine laws in a great and general assembly of all israel of all the princes great officers judges and people of every rank and quality strangers and others old and young  single pillars were also erected by these holy men over the graves of the illustrious dead by some public and much frequented road to have their memories preserved and to put the traveller in mind of their exemplary virtue and piety of his own short continuance on the stage of life and to fit and make himself worthy of such another honorable memorial at his death and of an eternal diadem thus jacob buried rachel the solace and partner of his cares who died with the birth of their son benjamin rachel died and was buried in the way to ephrah which is bethlehem and jacob set a pillar on her grave that is the pillar of rachels grave to this day  persons of inferior condition and figure were buried under the shady oaks that flourished at the bottom of the mounts on which the bethels or temples stood they were called the oaks of weeping deborah rebekahs nurse died and she was buried beneath bethel under an oak and the name of it was called allon backuth  heaps of stones rudely cast together were the tombs they assigned to infidel enemies after execution even crowned heads in avenues and places of great concourse to be warnings to the rest of mankind how they rose up against the god of israel and dishonored his bethel or holy temple such a memorial had the king of ai executed by joshua as soon as the sun was down joshua commanded that they should take his carcass down from the tree and cast it on the entering of the gate of the city and raise thereon a great heap of stones that remains to this day  such a memorial likewise had achan and his family whose bodies were first burnt to ashes with all their treasure and wealth  hence the open temples the pillars the obelisks the consecrated groves of oak the heaps of stones reared by the pagans to their false gods and to the memory of the dead hence the egyptian pyramid hence the fair column of the greeks the romans and of the several nations taught and ruled by the druids the primitive religious rites accompanying mankind upon their grand dispersion at the tower of babel about the  00th year after the flood according to the samaritan computation  wallis   returning to the military road between the   th and   th mile stone is a view of  welton tower situate on a rising ground adjoining a small village there is nothing singular in the structure on entering northumberland my companion the ingenious mr bailey assisted me to draw views of many towers but such a sameness reigned through the whole and they multiplied upon us so fast we were obliged to desist from further prosecution of so wearisome and unprofitable a work  we trod the hallowed ground where finan as bede tells us then bishop of lindisfarn baptized sigebert king of the east saxons and penda king of the mercians with a numerous train of nobles and adherents this was the ancient seat of the weltons simon de welton  0 king henry iv thomas    king henry vi simon   king edward iv michael    king charles i wallis of simon de welton in the reign of king henry iv and continued in that family till the reign of king charles i  at a little distance from thence stands  halton tower there is nothing remarkable in this structure it appertained to the ancient family of haltons and was possessed in the reign of king henry iii by john de halton john de halton king henry iii william  of denum    king edward i high sheriff of northumberland   th of that reign margaret married robert de lowther  married carnaby the whole vested in the carnabys king richard ii william carnaby   king henry iv high sheriff of northumberland sir john    king henry vi sir reginold    king henry viii high sheriff of northumberland sir cuthbert   queen elizabeth high sheriff sir william    king james i member of

to two coheiresses through whom one moiety came to the family of lowthers and the other to that of the carnabys in the reign of king henry iv the whole possession was in the carnaby family with whom it continued for many generations one of whom sir william carnaby being a loyalist at the battle of marsdon moor in the northumberland regiment commanded by the marquis of newcastle was obliged to fly the land  here is preserved a sword of the carnabys    inches long one of those illproportioned instruments which was decisive at one blow or left its owner at the mercy of his adversary unable to recover his weapon for a second attack such swords as these were used by the gauls in their wars with the romans as a defense against which the roman general camillus contrived a shield or buckler of iron of the parma kind of a round form and adorned with studs of brass mars bellator of gradivus is usually described with such a shield it was part of the armatura equitum and borne on the left arm  wallis it was difficult to be wielded with any effect by a footman and undoubtedly appertained to the horse service mr wallis gives the following anecdote of one of the carnaby family at the time that this country was infested with those thieves called moss troopers one of this family had a commission to apprehend and try them whilst he was deeply engaged on the trial of some of them a very notorious and desperate villain was seized by his son who asked his father what he should do with him do with him said the father why hang him as soon as the trial was ended he ordered the man to be brought before him but was told he was hanged instantly according to his order on complaint being made to the crown a fine of  l per annum was laid on the halton etate which is still paid  wallis a similar story is told of lord william howard at nawarth in cumberland   the shield devised by the romans as a defense against the same was borne by the horsemen  halton was purchased by john douglas esquire he rebuilt the old parochial chapel there which was then in ruins for the case of his tenants though at no great distance from the mother church the vicar of corbridge officiates here every third sunday in the forenoon and at crbridge the parish church in the afternoon of newcastle in the year   0  and by marriage has become the possession of sir edward blackett  within view from the tower is  halton chesters the hunnum of the romans situate on an easy descent the remains of the vallum not perfectly to be traced  this station is the next fort that appears upon the wall between rutchester and walwick chesters and comes at a due distance and in proper order for the ancient hunnum the fifth station in the series of the notitia garrisoned by the ala saviniana  mr gordon omitting the station at halton makes walwick chesters to be hunnum and supposes cilurnum the next station in the notitia to have been between walwick chesters and precolitia or carrawbrugh but now entirely demolished this cannot hold for the walls and their appurtenances are here in the greatest perfection how then should a fort on that part of the wall be entirely ruined so as not to have the least vestige remaining besides the great distance between rutchester and walwick which is above twelve miles shows that there must have been at least one station between them and on the other hand the small distance between walwick chesters and carrawbrugh which is little more than three measured miles renders it most unlikely that there ever should have been another station between them  hadrians vallum seems to have fallen in with the south rampart of this fort and severuss wall with the north line of the inner part there seems to have been an aqueduct to convey water to this station from a spring on the higher ground near watlingstreetgate when mr horsley passed that way he says he was shown a part of it by a countryman who said it was what the speaking trumpet was lodged in of this matter i have treated before  the ruins of the outbuildings are to the south and southeast of the fort near about a furlong to the east of watlingstreetgate is a visible castellum and at the gate there has been a square castellum half within the wall and half without  mr horsley remarks that severuss military way appears very distinct for the small spaces where it is separated from hadrians north vallum regularly paved but not much raised above the level of the ground when the two are united they make a military way very beautiful and magnificent and the rest both of severuss and hadrians works are ample and conspicuous all this way as for the course of severuss military way and its coinciding with hadrians north vallum and going off from it again at every castellum it seems very curious and it is remarkable that it has not been more observed  from st oswalds to the river of north tyne some parts or appurtenances of the walls become more faint and obscure and some not visible at all but yet severuss wall the ditch and hadrians vallum and ditch are very apparent after the wall has crossed the tyne it goes to walwick as before described the distance from whence to halton chesters is near five measured miles and a quarter and in this interval there are five visible castella besides one that must have stood near the river tyne but is now entirely lost the constant distance between these castella seems to have been seven furlongs  dr hunter mr smith and others take notice of some remains at portgate or near it within a mile of the chesters and in the new edition of camden it is observed that there is at portgate a square old tower still standing and great ruins of old buildings but it was mr horsleys opinion this tower had nothing in it that was roman being of the same form with a multitude of others that are in the north and of a much later date the ruins are at halton before spoken of  besides the inscriptions mentioned by mr horsley the following were found here  a centurial stone now in the custody of sir edward blackett with a civic garland rudely sculptured and a figure of the roman eagle inscribed leg ii avg e   at the same time was found an extispicia of wood the instrument used by the auspices in examining the entrails of sacrificed animals another centurial stone was also found here inscribed leg xx vv hortens procvl   urns have been dug up here with some coins of nero and constantine and also some of magnentius and decentius the remains of sacrifices have also been discovered here this legion according to dr stukely after harvest held a solemn festival dedicated to ceres and ops the usual victim was a boar mr horsley treats of the following inscription found here  xx cohortis seae centuria statii solonis posuit  this was in the w of an enclosure not far from portgate castle it was erected by the century of statius sla a centurion of the sixth cohort probably of the sixth legion called victorious which legion erected ths inscription  at a cllm were found some ur coarse and whitish     we approached  ayden castle now greatly in decay the situation is formidable and from the solemnity of its ruins is at this time strikingly august it is placed on the west side of a deep gill on the brink of a precipice at whose foot runs a little brook by the traces remaining of this edifice it appears to have been of considerable extent and strength encompassed by an outward wall in which the loopholes remain one thing remarkable here is a stable with an arched roof of stone without any wood in its structure the mangers being formed of stone troughs it seems constructed for the preservation of cattle at the time of assault  the precipice is famous for a lovers leap an exploit in amor totally neglected in our degenerate days and incompatible with the silken softness of modern gallants who court the hand of destruction by modes more truly french when despair ruffles their plumes this custom is truly british the influenza of our heavy and gloomy atmosphere  we read of no such thing in antiquity or the manners of other nations jack who made his leap here has immortalized his name but we are deprived of that of his dulcinea whose frowns had such power over his forlorn heart intercourse with polite nations has introduced many changes in our manners most suicides nowadays are in despair of getting a separation from the sex and not their possession  the prospect from hence is delightful comprehending the vale over which hexham with imperial looks smiles graciously the river is seen in various meanderings and the opposite banks are graced with the elegant mansion of beaufront flanked with its extensive plantations  ayden castle was the inheritance of the family of aydens emma de ayden   king edward i escheats of that reign  for several generations it appertained to emma de ayden a rich heiress in the reign of king edward i he gave her in marriage to peter de wallis whose name is said to be local and derived from wallis in france and that he was of the same race of the scotch patriot wallis whose ancestor came into britain with the conqueror ayden afterward became the inheritance of the raymes william de raymes    king edward iii high sheriff edward    king henry vi robert  0 queen elizabeth high sheriff henry king charles i wallis of bolham and was in that family from the reign of king edward iii to that of king charles i a part of the ayden estate is said to have been in the family of the carnabys  camden says near this place was dug up an ancient monument on which the effigy of a man was cut resting on his left arm upon a couch in the attitude used by the romans his right hand laid upon his right knee with the following inscription      norici an xxx  essorivs magnus frater eivs dvpl ale sabiniane which may be read thus norici annorum triginta messorius magnus frater ejus duplaris alae sabinianae this is a curious and useful inscription as it confirms this place to be the station of hunnum the cut of the letters is neither very good nor exact nor are they very regular as to their magnitude or distances one from another and the the whole favors of the lower empire the original is at conington norricus is a roman name that occurs several times in gruter and the name messorius is found also in an inscription at risingham in this county the mark at the bottom looked like a part of a letter as if this stone had been parted from another upon which there was some inscription camden supposes that sabina hadrians wife gave the name to this ala but it was thought more probable by mr horsley that it was taken from sabinia the wife of the emperor gordian to whose time this inscription much better agrees  also the following inscription is mentioned by camden m mari us velli a long us aqvi s hanc posvit v s l m m marius vellia longus aquis hanc posuit v s l m mr horsley presumed that aquis here is for eques so equis for eques we meet with in other instances and perhaps an a for an e has been the error of the transcriber this horseman might also belong to the ala sabiniana  we descended to  corbridge though the town makes a pretty appearance at the foot of the vale when you see it from hexham it disappoints the traveller greatly on his entrance to find it dirty and disagreeable  this is an ancient borough joannes filius roberte

others to the poor of this parish  in the year      there was found near corbridge a curious piece of roman plate now in the possession of his grace the duke of northumberland it weighs     ounces is  0 inches long and    broad a print of which engraved by virtue some years ago was published by mr william shaftoe we intended whilst upon our journey to have procured a drawing of this curious piece of antiquity but on our arrival at alnwick found the castle crowded with visitants it being one of his graces public days when the popularity and libera spirit so eminently distinguished in his graces character laid open the gates of his palace the annexed plate is a copy taken from the engraving by virtue   it is probable this piece of plate was not for sacred uses but was a lanx for the service of the emperors table on high festivals and expressive of some great achievement to the glory of the roman eagle the locality and the event being lost to us in the distant antiquity  the best description and definition now extant have been communicated to me among the manuscripts of the late roger gale esquire and i do not doubt the curious reader will readily pardon my inserting the papers at length which relate thereto  from the manuscripts of the late roger gale esquire  extract from the newcastle newspaper with an account of an ancient silver plate found near corbridge in northumberland  a few days since near the roman wall in northumberland was found by a smiths daughter in corbridge an ancient piece of silver in shape like a teaboard  0 inches long and    broad hollowed about an inch deep with a flat brim an inch and a quarter broad neatly flowered with a vine full of grapes etc  on the right hand is a figure of apollo with the bow in his left hand and a physical herb in his right under a canopy supported by two corinthian pillars near his left leg is attire under it an helistrope and at his feet a python near the right hand pillar is another of a different form with a sun for its capital against this sits a priestess on a tripod who looks over her shoulder at apollo under her feet is an altar near which lies a stag on his back  the next figure to the priestess is another female her head unveiled with a spear or wand in her left hand on the top of which is a ball and near her is minerva with a helmet on her head a spear in her left hand pointing with her right to a man supposed an hunter on the other side of a large tree on minervas breast is a medusas head under her feet an altar and near it a wolf looking up to a man who has a bow in his left and an arrow in his right hand below him at one corner of the plate is a rock with an urn in the midst of it from which flows a stream the figures are raised large and well proportioned and castwork without the least sign of a graver upon it there are a few scratches of a punch or chisel on the back of it the three first are i px but the rest is very unintelligible it had under the middle of it a low frame about   inches long   broad and one and an half deep but this was broken off by the smith though once all of a piece it was found by a little brook or watercourse near the abovementioned place and weighing about     ounces was bought by mr cookson a goldsmith of newcastle who values it at a high rate it has been described by several virtuosi to the royal society that of the antiquarians and others who esteem it a valuable relic of antiquity  letter from mr robert cay with an account of the corbridge silver plate   march      sir my fondness to antiquity is revived and with it the memory of my obligations to you by a silver table that has lately fallen into the hands of mr isaac cookson a goldsmith in this town it was found near corbridge by some ignorant poor people who have cut off the feet in such a vile barbarous manner that they have broke two holes through the table and a small piece off one of the corners too it is    inches and long and    broad the feet   long and   broad and about one inch high it weighs about   0 ounces i imagine it to have been cast all in one piece most of the work is in basse relief the rest engraved it represents a sacrifice to apollo whose image stands in a small temple by two corinthian pillars against one of them seems to be a pile of some square blocks and close to it sits a priestess upon a stool that shows but two feet behind her is a column with a globe upon it i suppose to represent the sun though had it been alone i should not have thought so near her stands another in the same habit and a third that seems to have the attributes of pallas particularly the headpiece near the last is a man this figure is diana not a man  r g with a bow in his left hand and an arrow in his right before him is an altar and a dog i think a greyhound near him behind him is a large spreading tree with an eagle parched upon it there are also several small birds about it but these are only engraved in the lower corner next the man on the left hand as you look at it there is a rocky hill and on the side of it lies an urn with a stream of water running out perhaps designed to represent the river tyne the two standing women hold each of them a staff of their own height before the temple is another altar on one side of which lies a griffin and on the other side next the man a buck which seems to be killed for a sacrifice near the buck grow two ears of corn tied together and near the griffin a shrub of three or four branches that has at the end of each branch somewhat formed like a fan there is a border raised round the whole higher than the plain which is adorned with a vine the branch is engraved but the grapes and leaves are in basse relief i am sir yours etc  robert cay newcastle   march      i heartily wish this table was in the hands of some curious gentleman well able to make such purchases for i find mr cookson will expect profit though i hope he will not be unreasonable i should have taken notice that the workmanship appears in all respects to be of the lower empire     another letter from mr cay on the corbridge silver plate     march      sir soon after the post was gone from hence i received yours of the   th this morning i went to the goldsmith who soon convinced me of my error in saying the birds etc were engraved and that all which i thought to be engraved was struck with the chisel and punch so that i must own your suspicions were well grounded mr cooksons father happens to be here now i take him to be well versed in the art of casting of metals he showed me several marks near one end in the middle of which end there is a crack which marks and crack he says are proofs that it was cast in one piece  i enquired again about the price but mr cookson waved saying any thing different from what i mentioned to you yesterday which was that he hoped it would produce him about  00 guineas  as to the place where it was found he says he can tell me no more than that it was somewhere near corbridge he apprehends the person who sold it to him was afraid to name the particular place or to confess in whose manor it was discovered as fearing a claim from the lord of the manor  since writing the above i am told a kind of a claim has been made on behalf of the duke of somerset though neither his graces officer nor the goldsmith know in whose manor it was found  on the back of the table there is a kind of inscription which i cannot pretend to read but will endeavor to represent it below  i am sir yours etc robert cay p s i am told two other pieces of antique plate have been since found in the same place one of them was sold to a gentleman in cumberland and the other to a goldsmith in this town who thinking it much damaged had melted it down before i heard of it  r c     letter from sir john clerk in answer to one from mr gale giving an account of the corbridge silver plate the account you have sent me of the silver table found near corbridge is very surprising how happy had mr gorden and i been when we were hunting for roman antiquities in that country if this valuable curiosity had fallen into our hands as to the use of it i make no question of its being a tabula votiva and that it has been hung up or kept in a temple at corbridge dedicated perhaps to apollo or ceres no doubt the roman officer who commanded in these northern parts of britain thought himself very happy to find good meat and drink in a country where he expected to find nothing but famine and barbarity and therefore in gratitude made this present to the god of the place  i cannot help since i am in this way of thinking to reflect a little upon what i observed in a church called notre dame de halle about    miles from brussels the walls were hung round with silver legs and arms cups and several other things in silver as tokens of gratitude to the blessed virgin for having by her means and intercession been recovered from infirmities and distempers  among other things i could not but take notice of a silver pen which old doting justus lipsius had sent thither some years before out of gratitude as an inscription told us for that by the assistance of the virgin mary he had been enabled with so much eloquence etc to write a treatise de miraculis b virginis hallensis i called to mind upon that occasion passages very agreeable to your silver table and applicable  hic steterat nautis olim venerabile lignum servati ex undis ubi figere dona solebant laurenti divo et votis suspendere vestes virg aen lib    v       me tabula sacer votiva paries indicat uvida suspendisse potenti vestimenta maris deo hor   lib carm od    you are pleased to express some doubt as to the engraving and i think you have reason the romans i believe never practiced our way of engraving yet they did what was next to it for they were used to cut some remarkable laws and edicts in brass tables as they used to make inscriptions in marble or stone i have seen some of these particularly at lions which at that time made me reflect on the dullness of the romans and all mankind besides that by means of these brass plates they had not fallen upon the art of printing for if these had been daubed over with any sort of color and clapped upon the paper or parchment they would soon have introduced that art but there are many plain things that mankind cannot see into all of a sudden and which are reserved for posterity i would be glad to hear from you after you have seen this fine plate it is well the goldsmith did not melt it down as some modern goths of this trade have frequently done  i am ever sir pennycink   th march      your most faithful humble servant john clerk by way of corollary i must add to what i have said above that if search was made in the very place where this plate was found many fine things may probably be discovered  see postscript to mr cays letter   th march          letter from maurice johnson esquire in answer to one from mr gale giving an account of the corbridge silver plate etc  d may      sir it was with much pleasure i received and communicated to our little fraternity your very obliging and ingenious account of the corbridge silver table which honor i am commanded to return you thanks for and for your very kind promise of continuing to us the most valuable favor of your ever entertaining judicious and improving correspondence on reading your account of that massy piece some of us thought it might have been part of an acerra or sacred coffer wherein incense and odours were preserved for the service of the altar or salt etc for some sorts of sacrifices others have perhaps with more reason conceived it to be a stand salver or sort of waiter to set such things on or even the acerra or perhaps for domestic uses for we are too apt to apply every relic of antiquity as being venerable to sacred purposes the society next succeeding which was the  st of last month we had much the like account but the dimensions a little different and the figures or characters on the back said to be i p x with the unintelligible traces of more to us they are so  our friend and brother member mr bogdani in a letter i lately received from him tells me you now seem to think this piece cast or wrought in the saxon this is a mistake in mr b for i never told him so or ever had the least surmise of its being saxon  r g times of which people as we have fewer remains in the arts of designing when they are said to have been in a great measure lost i should be glad if this showed us somewhat of their ceremonies or customs than of the romans of which we have many and under whom from the graecia capta to the utter declension of their empire we have in almost every part of the world most splendid remains but from what i remember to have read in verstegan or elsewhere of the saxons i cannot apply any part of this design peculiarly to any piece of their sacred or civil history from the coins even of their latest princes they seem to me to have had less notions of designing after nature and to have done their work in a much worse taste than our old british ancestors of whom i am satisfied i have seen several coins or medals in every one of the three metals not imitating or borrowed from the romans or made by roman workmen and of these some by the extraordinary boldness of the relief and all by their convexity more in the manner of some of the eastern people than the romans to whom the manner of chariotfighting seemed strange though very customary with the eastern nations whose strength for the battle was frequently calculated or estimated by the number of their chariots and horsemen and i cannot say i ever saw a fair piece of old unequal coin found in england but had on it some design of a horse horseman chariot or wheels and sometimes with more things with them notwithstanding what has been advanced against the judgment of sir robert cotton seldom speed camden etc i cannot but think that in the main they give us rational conjectures about the british coins or medals if we should not allow them to be current coin for which yet i see not any reason unless we are bound to take all for truth and fact which the romans relate and admit also that they told the whole truth and all that was really fact of those brave polite and honest people whom they so gloried in annoying and distressing sed manum de tabula  only give me leave by you sir to present our thanks to your good brother for his ingenious dissertation on caesars landing which gave our society much pleasure particularly our worthy president and another member who having some years resided in those parts well knew all the places therein mentioned  what we have had of late communicated spalding society has been chiefly poems and some philosophical experiments schemes of draining and several petrifactions presented to our petty musaeum where we continue to amuse ourselves every thursday and remember with pleasure our friends at the mitre  on the   th ult the rev mr ray v p showed the society a sculpture in ivory of a skeleton sitting on a monument with a winding sheet thrown over him like a loose robe resting his right hand on an hour glass and his left on his scythe with sculls and bones in bass relief on the sides of the monument the blade of the scythe had teeth like a sickle the work seemed of some age but as a physician said not accurate  he also showed a paper mss in   o of the whole book of psalms in number   0 written in french most elegantly in all the hands in use throughout europe by

you have done to us all and more particularly to  dear sir your most obedient humble servant maurice johnson spalding   may       part of a letter from sir john clerk relating the corbridge silver plate sir i had yours of the  st instant in due time but since you was to go down to cambridge i delayed giving you any trouble till now i am very much obliged to you for the particular account you have been pleased to send me of the silver table i am sorry that you think it not ancient and yet by the figures it should seem so still i humbly think that if these figures relate to any known piece of history among the ancients they may be modern but if they relate to nothing of this kind they may be ancient still at least of the lower empire or the greek in father mabillons diplomata there are several engravings which one would believe to be modern and yet are of the  th  th  th  th and  th centuries the argument i now would draw from these is only this that in the  d and  th centuries there might have been some heathen engravings much of the same kind but you can best make the comparison who have seen the table  i am surprised with what you write me about the reception mr blackwalls book essay or enquiry into homers life and writings london printed      had with my good friend my lord islay  something or other has disobliged him for i know his respect for all men who are lovers of learning only as well as the literati themselves he had a particular regard for mr horsley who printed the britannia romana and was positively resolved to have done him service about the time when he died i am etc  john clerk pennycinck  0 may       part of another letter from sir john clerk on the corbridge silver plate dear sir i am glad that upon viewing the silver table you think it ancient this was always the notion i conceived of it for i could not imagine any modern sculptor could get into his head so much ancient imagery without any foundation from ancient history or fable i am indifferent who gets the better in the lawsuit duke of somerset against mr cookson but i hope it will be preserved and kept in the country i fancy with myself you will be able to discover some piece of our history from it for i make not the least question but it has been a present from some of the roman emperors and alludes to some memorable affairs at the time the table has served i believe for an oblation of fruits or corn on some remarkable altar near the wall erected to the honor of perhaps diana ceres or bacchus and that it has afterward been hung up in the temple dedicated to one of these deities an irishman would perhaps discover the antiquity of ireland from the harp and i believe you will be inclined to think one of the figures is a representation of britain i am etc    august      john clerk   letter from roger gale esquire to mr robert cay upon the silver plate found at corbridge when i wrote last i had only time to return you thanks for the favor you procured me from mr cookson of taking a draught of his most curious silver table being to go out of town next morning since i came back upon perusing the letters i received from you on that occasion i find in one of them a desire of knowing my thoughts upon that subject which i cannot refuse to a gentleman who has laid me under so many obligations and to whom the pleasure and entertainment i have received from the frequent views of that uncommon and valuable piece of antiquity are entirely due and the less because the accounts hitherto published of it seem to me not a little erroneous  i shall begin to describe it from the right hand to the left as you look upon the face of the plate where apollo the principal figure in the whole piece is placed in a fanum or small temple the roof of which is supported by two wreathed columns with flowered capitals almost naked having only a pallium hanging down from his left shoulder over his back in the same hand is his bow which he holds up toward the top of the column on the same side his right hand is extended downwards with a branch in it perhaps of laurel cross that pillar against which almost to the middle of it rises a pyramidical pile of    pieces for what it is intended i must confess my ignorance  see the plate  against the basis of the left hand column rests a lyre whose form is truly antique and beneath it grows a plant with three spreading flowers at its three extremities designed as i suppose for an heliotrope close by it couches a griffin with its wings elevated over its back the ancients had so high an opinion of the sagacity of this fictitious animal that they consecrated it to the god of wisdom begerus gives us a medal of commodus the reverse whereof is apollo in a chariot drawn by two griffins and the poet claudian alludes to this manner of his riding in the following distich ac si phoebus adest et fraenis grypha jugalem riphaeo tripodas repetens detorsit ab axis etc claudian vi cons honorii    against the right hand column and this pyramidical pile sits a woman upon a square fourfooted stool though no more than two of its legs are visible she looks backward over her left shoulder toward apollo and is wrapped up in a long garment or stola from head to foot and veiled by this attire and the altar which was brought from troy with the eternal fire burning upon it just by her i take her to be vesta   manibus vittas vestamque potentem aeternumque adytis effert penetralibus ignem virgil et vos virginea lucentes semper in ara laomidontiae trojana altaria flammae sil hal her left hand is reposed upon her breast and in her right which rests upon the same thigh she holds a little bundle bound about with a ribbon perhaps of wool  below her lies a buck dead on one side turning up his belly and behind her rises a tall pillar with a globe upon it probably to denote the earth of which she was goddess  the next is a woman erect her hair gathered up and tied with a knot behind upon her forehead rises a tutulus and she is habited in a stola from her shoulders to the ground her right arm is wrapped up cross her breast in her garb only the hand appearing out of it in her left she holds a spear the shaft twisted the iron of it something obtuse this seems to be the only human figure in the company but a very learned gentleman mr blackwall author of the inquiry into the life and writings of homer of my acquaintance thinks it may be designed for juno who is often thus accoutred with a spear if so it must be the effigies of juno curis or juno hastata we have it from ovid   quod hasta curis priscis est dicta sabinis she was the same with juno pronuba celebri hasta nubentis caput comebatur vel quia junonis curitis in tutela esset vel ut fortes viros ominaretur but as there is no peacock nor any other attribute of her divinity attending her and her appearance no ways majestic or adequate to the  divum regina jovisque et soror et conjux i cannot be entirely of his opinion especially as she seems by her posture and attitude to be a follower and attendant of the next figure which is plainly pallas  galea effulgens et gorgone saeva the head of that monster as usual being fixed upon her breast in her left hand she holds a sharppointed spear her right is extended toward diana with whom she seems engaged in a very earnest discourse to which also that goddess seems very attentive she is the last figure in the group though called a man in all the accounts i have seen of this table and represented here as the diana venatrix by the coif and feminine dress of her head tucked up with a knot behind like the hair of the third figure as well as by the bow in her left and arrow in her right hand her short tunica which reaches down little more than to the middle of her thighs and her buskins that come up no higher than the calf of her legs has occasioned this mistake of her sex but ovid tells us talia succincta pinguntur crura dianae cum sequitur fortes fortior ipsa feras between the two figures of pallas and diana rises a tall slender tree with a crooked waving stem the branches of which are displayed almost over twothirds of the top of the plate on the main branch is perched an eagle with one wing expanded as if going to take a flight this is of raised solid work like the rest of the figures but there are several small birds sitting among the boughs that are only punchd or cut in with a tool as are also several festoons hanging down from the tree and many other little shrubs and flowers interspersed all over the area of the table the great bird sitting directly over the head of pallas made me conclude at first that it was her owl till i had seen the original which convinced me that it can be designed for nothing but an eagle  under this tree stands an altar and so close to diana that she holds her left hand and bow over it it is but little and has nothing upon it except a small globular body perhaps a mass of the libamina ex far melle et oleo  i should have told you that below the feet of pallas grows a plant which seems to bear two ears of corn upon the same stalk but cannot say what it is or how it belongs to her beneath the tree and the little altar stands a thingutted dog like a greyhound his nose turned up in a howling or barking posture as often exhibited with this goddess on medals and in other representations of her some  acutae vocis hyclator aut substricta gerens sicyonius ilia ludon ovid under her in the very corner of the plate rises a rock upon which she sets her left foot and against the side of it lies an urn with the mouth downwards discharging a plentiful stream of water as she stands upon this rock or hill and so near to this spreading tree i cannot but think of horaces address to her montium custos nemorumque virgo the whole table is encompassed with a border raised near an inch high and ornamented with a creeping vine whose grapes and leaves are in relievo but the stalk only tooled  the work of this curious piece is neither of the best or worst of times the figure of vesta particularly is extremely well executed the posture free the drapery soft and easy and what is very remarkable the instita or border an ornament of the stola appropriated to the roman ladies of quality  quarum subsuta talos tegit instita vest horace is neatly worked all round this of our vesta and those of the other female deities nor is the next figure much inferior i cannot nor has any body else who has seen it discover that the plan has any relation to any story in the heathen mythology but seems only an assemblage of the deities it represents this may be some argument of its antiquity see sir john clerks letter  th august      for had a modern workman had the designing of it he would in all probability have taken some known piece of history for his subject to which i may add all the symbols are genuine and truly adapted to their owners  i was once of opinion that it might have been the cover of an acerra but the foot which supported it puts an end to the surmise we dont well know what the anclabris was the definition of it is in festus as follows anclabris mensa divinis ministeriis apta dicebantur autem anclabria et anclabris ab anculare quod erat ministrare this is big enough to contain the exta of a sheep or other small victims which seems to me to be the likeliest employment for it and that it was one of these sacrificing utensils that virgil more than once calls lances lancibus et pandis fumantia reddimus exta virg g   v        lancesque et liba feremus virg g   v      dona ferunt cumulantque oneratis lancibus aras virg aen   v      these lances were both round and square but the discus used for the same purpose seems to have been always round  if you have the patience to read this over you will have reason to think me not a little impertinent in giving you so minute a description of what you had seen so often and so long before it came under my view but as i chance to have some notions different from what appeared to you and as i could not well explain my thoughts upon it without entering into the particulars i hope you will excuse me my service to mr cookson if he is desirous of seeing this he may command it but pray let no copy be taken of it  i am your most obedient humble servant r gale london   d aug      nb letters to the same purport though not so full were wrote to mr maurice johnson dr stukeley and sir john clerk by me  r g     letter from maurice johnson esquire about the corbridge silver plate sir your most obliging and ingenious account of the corbridge silver table and dissertation upon it i received and read to our society last thursday the   st instant at which were present our rev president and    other members and   honorary and return you their and my thanks for that excellent entertainment as you give leave to conjecture at the female figure erect her hair tied up with a knot behind with a small oval the oval is much too big for a pearl perhaps a british pearl for which our coast was in the roman times famous her right arm wrapped up a spear with an obtuse point in her left permit me to opine this may be in honor to our isle and to represent britannia as on a coin of hadrian in my collection or the genius of great britain still retained in the reverse of our copper coin but in a sedentary posture sometimes by the ancients with an hasta pura sometimes armed with an iron sharpheaded one here as between both with an obtuse bluntheaded one as worn in war se defendendo amongst the romans i know not what else to think it and as formed amongst us who so likely the pyramidical figure i take only to denote stabilitas aeterna and was though in a less elegant form the device of representing the deity in the earliest times of art before statuaries had taught marbles to assume limbs and almost to breathe whatever this noble piece of plate was designed for i take it to have been a grand compliment to our native country and am therefore now the more desirous of being possessed of a drawing of it  spalding   th aug      m johnson   mr gales answer to the preceding letter sir i am much pleased that the last account i sent of the corbridge plate met with so good a reception from the gentlemen for whose entertainment i designed it we must yet call it the corbridge plate since at present it is said to have been found near that town though i am inclined to think it is only given out so to conceal the true place where it was discovered when the bill that the duke of somerset has filed in chancery against the present possessor of it for treasuretrove in his royalty comes to be argued we may come to the truth this contest with his grace made the owner very shy of letting it be seen by any body and it was not without great importunity that a gentleman to whom he was under the strongest obligations procured me the favor of taking a draught of it and upon condition that i should not permit any one to copy it nor know where the original which has been shifted into two or three hands is now deposited my promise to comply with these terms must plead my excuse for not permitting any body to take a copy of mine till the dispute is determined or i have leave to impart it to my friends among whom you may then command it with the first i had some weeks ago given a very short account of the figures on this table to sir john clerk at edinburgh a gentleman whose learning and judgment are of a superior degree he had from what i said to him the very same opinion as yourself about the unknown figure viz that it might represent britannia but i believe both you and he would change your thoughts upon inspection of it it is entirely roman by the habit and not the least circumstance attending it that may honor our country with being in so celestial a rendezvous of deities  your conjecture upon the pyramidical pile i like well i was once of opinion that it might have been some sort of an altar dedicated to apollo and that the    pieces of which it consists might have some relation to the    months of the year tellus stabilis we have upon the coins of hadrian sabina faustina pii and commodus but without this pyramid in our table it is erected as near to vesta as to apollo and so may be an attribute belonging as well to her the goddess of the earth as to him the god of the year my best services attend your flourishing society and i am etc  r gale   letter from dr stuleley concerning the corbridge plate and a like piece found in risley park in derbyshire to mr gale dearest sir i thank you for the account of the roman salver it is exactly such a sort of utensil as that found in risley park in derbyshire eight years ago of which i wrote a large account and traced it from an altar in france where it was given by exuperius the bishop a friend of st jeromes till it got to derby and probably thence to dale abbey altar near which it was found  we may conjecture it to have been buried at the dissolution or in war time it is not unlikely that the northumbrian plate was st wilfrids originally and belonged to his cathedral at hexham buried there at his banishment or since he might purchase it in his travels in france or at rome i take them to have been to adorn the sideboards of the romans upon festivals  i have drawn lately abbot fountains of croyland chair at upton preserved by bishop dove at the dissolution i am become a great mandarin and have wrote two or three verses of the beginning of the book of genesis in chinese  i am etc w stukeley stamford    sept       two altars of the greatest value to antiquaries were found here the one adorned on one side with a wreath and on the other with an oxs head and a knife dedicated by diodora hercules was the symbol of the sun julian informs us that magnificent sports were celebrated at the conclusion of the year to the invincible sun and the inscription soli invicto is found upon the medals of many of the roman emperors divine honors were paid to him in open temples and groves  wallis the corbridge altars have been learnedly wrote on by several ingenious persons besides those quoted which are published in the  st volume of the archaeologia v   p       but the best explanation has been given by the hon danies barrington in the  th volume of that work from whence the following extracts are made  both inscriptions if read at length make two regular hexameters viz  which conjecture has been confirmed by mr graham of netherby who says there are still traces of the cross stroke forming the top of the p which is the first letter in the name of the person who consecrates the altar   mr wallis if not an error of his printer seems to be more mistaken than dr todd in his opinion of this altar supposing it to be an altar in honor of tyrian hercules dedicated to diodora the priestess v   p      there are some singular circumstances attending these altars which may perhaps be deemed companions  they furnish the only greek inscriptions which were ever found in great britain they both consist of a single hexameter they are inscribed to syrian deities and they are discovered in the same parish of corbridge  it is not extraordinary that greek inscriptions should be scarce in england it is rather necessary to account why any such should have been discovered though the romans most commonly used their own language and characters yet some of them must have been born under circumstances which made the greek tongue more familiar to them we need therefore only suppose that pulcher and diodora who dedicate these two altars were the son and daughter of a roman officer quartered in greece or some neighboring province and who died soon after he had children by a grecian wife the greek language would certainly be more familiar than the latin to a roman with such an education they both consisting of hexameters seem to prove they were dedicated about the same time and and that they were intended to be companions especially as their outward form is very similar as well as the characters made use of the greater difficulty seems to be why both altars should be inscribed to the syrian deities astarte and tyrian hercules this however it seems may be accounted for to ways pulcher and diodora might possibly have either resided or been born in syria and had perhaps received some good fortune which they might ascribe at least to these deities it is conceived that wherever a roman continued for anytime he probably worshipped the local deities when there were not temples at hand which were erected to the gods adored at rome such romans therefore might continue their veneration for astarte and tyrian hercules when removed from syria to britain but possibly it is not necessary that pulcher and diodora should have been at all in that province there is one difficulty however still remaining with regard to the altar dedicated to tyrian hercules which is that it is inscribed by a woman and archpriestess at first it strikes that she must have been archpriestess to such a god and i believe there are few instances of women having this dignity in the temples of male deities at the same time that there would be a particular indelicacy if they devoted themselves to hercules  as for these altars being found at corbridge it is easily accounted for if the above conjectures are allowed in other respects because it is known to have been a considerable station and near to the roman wall the inscription on the altar to the tyrian hercules has already been four times engraved and may perhaps be matter of curiosity to compare the different copies as the stone is soft and seems to have suffered within these  0 years some of the characters being e ffed  that the inscription is not more ancient than the time i ascribe it to may be proved if it was necessary by the  inscribed in the last word apxiepea though i have no less authority however than that of montfaucon for this remark yet it may not be improper to observe that seo masfe denies that any arguments drawn merely from the form of characters can be at all conclusive  extract of a letter from mr john horsley to roger gale esquire  th april      sir i am honored with yours of the  d instant which this morning came safe to hand i was not willing to loose the find opportunity of returning an answer and though i am upon this account obliged to write the more hastily yet i hope you will excuse it and attribute it to the true cause my zeal to serve you in every thing that lies in my power  there is no inscription in britain which i can better answer for than the greek one at cbridge i have several times seen and examined it myself with all the nicety and care i could at first sight i discerned a manifest difference in some things between the original and copies that had been published in the ph tr no   0 p     philosophical transactions and was more and more confirmed in my opinion when i reexamined it with a particular view to this difference however being very diffident of myself when i happen to differ from others i prevailed with a curious gentleman to go on purpose to take an impartial account of it i got also another to do the same and all our three copies agreed with a surprising exactness i have turned over all my papers this morning in quest of the first copy but can by no means find it the other i have met with and sent you enclosed my own is in the hands of the engraver at london and the plate containing this inscription is ready and i believe wrought off i take the plain meaning of this inscription to be no more than that this altar was erected to hercules by diadora the archpriestess if it be to the tyrian hercules the  d letter in the  d line must have been a double rho thus ph so as that it is tirrio for tyrio there is a flaw in the stone at the head of this letter so as that it may have been closed at the top but by that part of the letter left in the breach i am very certain that there was no y in the inscription the word in the  d line may be tirrio tiphio or tipsio probably a topical name but tyrio i am sure it is not  i discovered another greek inscription at lanchester which by the way i believe to be glanoventa and old town galana but it is so imperfect that i could scarce be sure it was greek if it will be acceptable i will transmit a copy of it to you the last time i saw the altar erected by diodora it was in the churchyard of corbridge the church of durham had formed a design to remove it thither but failed in their attempt i should be glad if they had made a second with better success doctor hunter told me pleasantly he would threaten the people of corbridge with a prosecution from the spiritual court for keeping a pagan altar in their church yard i asked him then what he would have done to those of bows who according to camden had used a heathen stone for their communion table  i am etc john horsley   extract of a letter to mr horsley from roger gale esquire   th april      sir i am much obliged to you for the quick return you made to my first letter and the most accurate copy of the greek inscription that you sent with it it was at the desire of mr mattatre that i wrote to you and both he and i are of your opinion that the second word could never have been  but then it is very difficult to unriddle the word  that gentleman has been very busy for some time in giving us a new edition of dr prideauxs marmora arundeliana   0 sheets are already printed off and as he is a person of the greatest learning industry and accuracy we may expect a performance equal to all those qualifications since the other greek inscription at langchester is so much obliterated that you can scarcely discern whether it is in that language or not you may excuse yourself the trouble of sending it to me but i make no doubt of your taking notice of it in your great work if it is only to show us that there has been one more inscription in that tongue found in this island where indeed it is very strange that we should have any at all  as for the inscription deo hercvlenti lately discovered at riechester i take it to be the very same as if it had been deo herculi and the termination enti to be only a metap lasmus after the greek manner as in the words  etc something like it you may see in other inscriptions as chryseti for chrysae in reinesiuss syntagma inser p  0   roger gale    the priestess of the tyrian hercules three feet four inches and a quarter in height        mr horsley published this inscription and esteemed it one of the greatest curiosities in britain it is now in the possession of the duke of northumberland  mr horsley gives the following reading and remarks upon it  h e herculi tirrio diodora princeps sacerdos it has been twice published in the transactions by dr hunter and dr todd the differences between their copies and this will appear upon comparing them one with another this copy was taken after the original had been thrice visited and examined with care and every variation in the former copies diligently marked dr todds delineation is different both from dr hunters and mine he translates it herculi tyrio divina dona archisacerdotalia vel per summum sacerdotem offerenda but he offers no reason to confirm this translation dr hunters copy has been taken with more exactness but not without some little variations from the original nor has he translated or explained the inscription but the most material difference between the other copies and the original is in the second letter of the second line which they represent as  though it is plainly  the next letter in the same line is very distinct as to the greatest part of it but toward the top is a flaw in the stone if no stroke or part of the letter is lost in this flaw the letter must be  if this break be supposed to contain a part of the letter which is most probable then it may either be  or rather a double  with one face backward as the double  is frequently expressed upon latin inscriptions if this be admitted the word will be tirrio probably for tyrio and the whole may then as i apprehend be translated as in the reading  several ancient writers take notice of the peculiar regard and worship paid to hercules by the tyrians arrian says his temple in that city was the oldest upon record diodora the archpriestess mentioned in this inscription might perhaps be devoted to his service that this was an office of great dignity and not below persons of the first rank appears from another inscription produced by montfaucon which is caracylaea arch priestess descended from kings we have likewise an inscription in the marmora oxoniensis where one aurelia fausta has this title given her that inscription having been erected at smyrna the learned editor supposes the lady was archpriestess to diana and among other reasons he assigns this because priestess ministered only to female deities now if this observation was universally true it would destroy the supposition above mentioned relating to diodora but there is an inscription in gruter ateria sacer  datis pa  which i think can mean nothing else but ateria priestess of pluto and pausanias says expressly that it was customary for a virgin to officiate as priestess in the temple of neptune in calaurea it appears therefore by these instances that women were not wholly excluded from the priesthood of male deities caracylaea in the inscription of montfaucon is said presently after to have been wife to c julius severus the same as montfaucon thinks who according to the fasti consulares was consul in the year     and why may we not suppose that diodora was married to some commander of the roman forces who brought her hither where she erected this altar in honor of the deity to whose service she had been particularly devoted and the like may be said with respect to other grecian deities whose altars are found here in britain as jupiter dolichenus and dea syria which might be set up by persons originally of those countries where these deities were more particularly worshipped  the other altar is dedicated to astarte astarte was the symbol of the moon being worshipped by moonlight in open temples and groves first with pure and afterward with impure rights in the sacred writings judges iii     reg xi   she

made on this altar in the  st volume of the archeologis by the rev dr pettingal and dr adee may also be agreeable to the reader in this place  the person who communicated this inscription to the society a few years ago informed us that it was found about corbridge near the wall where as there were many roman legions particularly the legio secunda augusta and vicesima victrix ordered thither the first from isca silurum the other from deva or chester in order to keep the wall in order and defend it we can make no doubt of its being roman notwithstanding it is written in greek characters for this manner of writing inscriptions was an affectation frequently to be met with in the lower empire or after the time of constantine and was sometimes carried so far that when the language was

light upon the particular oon eop which i am inclined to think stands for  from whence it will appear that this monumental altar was also an ara terminalis for  signifies a boundary between lands of different property and perhaps here between the allotments of the different companies of the soldiers  the word  does not stand here in a religious sense for an altar whereon they were to sacrifice or make libations to any god but signified the same as ara in the latin inscriptions  what was the use of this  when it was  and erected on the bounds of lands we may learn from the agrarian laws the placing them on the bounds of their lands or military a ments as meers or bounds to  property for which reason they are called by dolobella fines sepulrii and criti and seem to be confined merely to the partition of conquered lands among the soldiers the law of tiberius ordered cum ager divisus m traderetur extremis a compagnantibus agris limitibus monumenta sepulchrave sacrarentur that when lds were to be divided among the soldiers the monuments or sepulchers should always be in the bounds again forum igitur sepulchrorum sequenda est contio qua extre fimbus cncrrentes plu agrorum cursa spectant that the same law about sepulchers should continue and  which they were appointed as limits between adjoining lands by which i conceive  meant that all the lands inward from that sepulcher

and derived most probably from the east in the last chapter of joshua we read that he was buried in the border of his inheritance  the date of the inscription before us seems to be between the years

lineam vall at the time of writing it which was after  0  the time of the death of arcadius and    years after a d     the romans totally deserted britain so that this inscription is to be placed between the death of arcadius and the final departure of the romans  pettingal may  th       inscriptions in general greek ones particularly are accompanied with great embarrasments ng to their shortness the ignorance of carvers and the inaccuracy of transcribers and publishers few copies are fac miles though this inscription may be looked upon as such apprehend nothing can make grammar or sense of it but reading it in this manner        here the three most necessary companions in a votive inscription are expressly declared the goddess to whom it was dedicated  the thing dedicated  and the donor  it must be observed that  always governs a dative case of the person other expressed or understood instances of which in inscriptions are innumerable hence  must be read   s adee a syrian goddess and is now in the possession of the rev mr graham of netherby the engraving is copied from an elegant one given in the archaeologia dr stukeley gives the following reading of it marcus egorast the son of acherm dedicates this altar to astarte dr stukeley seems never to have been more unhappy in his conjectures than when he interprets these words as above the names he presumes are syriac arabic or punic and the adoption of marcus proceeds from the roman connection  this altar supposed to be inscribed by the priest is attributed to a marine legion raised by hadrian in syria called the ulpian legion which followed carausius in the time of maximian the following short anecdotes of carausius may not be disagreeable  the emperor carausius is represented as a graceful person he was descended of british parents the british empire by sea is attributed to him constantine instituted the office of comes litoris saxonici which carausius filled with immortal honor the saxons in that age sending forth a set of daring pirates who distressed the british coast under maximian he held the office of admiral of the roman navy he advanced to such a height in the esteem of the people that he was induced to throw off the roman authority and assume the imperial power in britain maximian with the whole naval force of rome approached the british coast to chastise him for his temerity and his associates for their defection he withstood them near the isle of wight with the british navy he sought and conquered and from that time held the supreme authority independent of rome superior to all its power but such is the precariousness of human glory such the instability of sublunary things this hero fell by the hands of an assassin in his palace at york slain by the traitorous sword of an insiduous wretch under the specious character of a friend  there is not in human life a more happy acquisition than a friend where we can find the feculence of falsehood long thrown down giving all the mind to benevolence and generosity but on the other hand there is not so pernicious an enemy as he who under a specious character insinuates himself into the bosom of a generous and openminded man and there like miltons toad poisoning the animal spirits carries on the operations of the devil if the regions of the damned are permitted to send forth the tribes of lucifer to torment mankind those of superior diabolic and infernal talents must take upon them this most accomplished of hellish characters     camden conjectures corbridge was the curia ottodinorum of the romans noted by ptolomy and the corstopitum of antonine he has this singular remark  that here king john searched for hidden treasures of the ancients but was deceived no less than nero when he sought for the hidden wealth of dido at carthage leland p       from my view of the extensive ruins at corchester near this place i should conceive it was the chief roman city in this part of britain leland says in his time the names of diverse streets remained and great tokens of old foundations  at a little distance from corbridge is  corchester where are the remains of a roman station it is unnoticed in the notitia and is conjectured was abandoned at the time of taking that account of the roman empire in britain it is not larger than those stations near the wall before described the remains of the pretorium are yet very conspicuous this station stands on the tongue of land formed by the stream of cor at its conflux with the tyne nothing curious remains at this time but the foundations of a bridge visible at low water believed to be of roman construction  dr todd in the philosophical transactions supposes the name to have been originally herculcester i e castra herculis what led him to this opinion is the altar with the greek inscription dedicated to the tyrian hercules mr horsley was of opinion that as corstopidum had been generally so it is very justly placed at the station near corbridge this place has generally been taken for ptolomys curia otadenorum because there seems to be some affinity between the names and because the otadini must certainly be placed hereabouts but he differs in opinion concerning this matter and concludes that corstopidum and curia were different names and altogether different places  the erminstreet way having crossed the tyne proceeds toward ebchester in the bishopric of durham and continues its course almost in a meridian line to dover in kent as may be seen in antoninuss itinerary another military way passes from this place southwest through dilston park over hexham fell to old town in alondale and meets with the maiden way at whitley castle as is set out in mr warburtons map of northumberland  the romans were excellent architects and by all the descriptions given of their bridges phil transactions in britain testified their geometrical knowledge their arch was semicircular their pillars multangular with a sharp angle to the stream like the prow of a ship the foundations of the piers were constructed of an horizontal arch made of stones in the form of a wedge as appears by the remains here in situations subject to rapid floods a small arch was formed in the pier to receive the water when it began to reach the bow of the arch  many roman antiques have been found here such as coins seals etc but most of them of the lower empire many seals of roman work were found at corchester greek and roman antiques were always of the most exquisite workmanship engravings on gems pebbles and stones of the first order for beauty and luster the beril the chalcedony the emerald hyacinth the topaz or modern chrysolite and the garnet were favorites the crystal pebble and the amathyst were also esteemed they also used the onyx the sardonyx the agate onyx the jasper the haemachates or boodstone which they valued for cameos other kinds were not used by the romans till the lower empire when the arts were upon the decline then camelians and stones of an inferior class were introduced of this order and species are the intaglios found at our roman stations the greek masters excelled the romans in the art of sculpture and engraving who resigned their genius more to oeconomical and political refinements  wallis in mr horsleys works we have the following inscriptions and sculptures  no c imperatori  marco aurelio antonino tribunitiae potestatis  this is in the fore wall of a house in corbridge on the right hand as you enter the village from the east it has no doubt been a curious inscription and is twice taken notice of in the philosophical transactions by dr hunter and dr todd i do not understand dr todds account who says there i saw altars inscribed one imp m aurelio  another leg ii aug coh iiii but this and the following stone which he refers to are honorary monuments not altars and neither of the inscriptions are exactly represented as appers from the copies i have given which are taken from the originals this stone is broken both on the left side and at the bottom so that although the inscription belongs to one of the antoninuss yet whether to marcus aurelius commodus or caracalla may be a question  ci legionis secundae augustae cohors quarta fecit  this is in the church wall and no doubt must be the same with that which dr todd mentions it is of the same sort with those which have frequently been erected by the legions and legionary cohorts when they were employed in building any work and i believe usually set in the face of it the o and h are imperfect part of the upper stratum of the stone being gone off  cii bisi   val   this inscription is more imperfect than either of the former it is broken at the top and at one end and is now fixed in the corner of a house in the town the letters which remain are very fair but one cannot tell how much is wanting i was told that this stone was found not many years ago and that there were more letters upon it when discovered which were afterward broken off by the workmen when they put it into the wall if we suppose the word in the lower line to have been vallum or valli and c is in the preceding line to have expressed the number of paces we have still more reason to regret the loss of the rest of it i could not be sure that the last imperfect stroke was the top of an i though the situation of it so high makes it probable the leaf before the word val does not favor the antiquity of it  ciii the sculpture represented is in the front of an old house the victory is curious and entire being winged with the usual drapery and attitude what she takes hold of seems to have been the ornamental part of a stone on which there has been an inscription the only peculiarity is that she seems to set each foot on a ball or globe  civ the lesser of these stones is in the jamb of a door and the larger lies at the door of another house in the town the people call this latter a horse i have placed them both under the same number as believing them to be of the same kind the latter appears to be a lion with some other animals under him the head of which is broken off in the other the heads of both animals are gone the lion does not seem to be devouring or destroying the other animal but rather desending it and i believe it is of the same nature with the sculpture at walwck grange the larger of these figures is very coarse and much defaced  cv the market cross stands on an altar on which there has been an inscription but now defaced on the sides of the altar are the figures described below they were half covered under the ground or under the steps of the cross but the earth and steps being removed they appeared at full length and are plly two human figures in one hand of each nothing can be discovered one of the figures seemed to be in a posture of motion with a lyre or harp in his hand which made me suspect it might be bacchus and the other holding a bow unstrung like apollo unless both may be supposed to represent apollo there was a faint stroke went up from the end of the bow which possibly may have been the string or an arrow which apollo hed together with the bow     we passed the tyne by a fine bridge of seven arches  dilston next attracted our notice the mansion house is now in ruins its situation is fine on the brink of a steep hill clothed with wood descending to the brook of devils water the approach we made was romantic the rivulet at its conflux with the tyne flows out of a deep dell forming a grand natural cascade after having passed a bridge of a single arch which leads to the mansion through this arch a mill is seen over which are lofty and impending cliffs the whole embowered by trees extending their branches from each side of the dell and spreading out a leafy canopy at least an hundred feet in height shadowing the lower objects with a solemn gloom  we approached the mansion now consisting of disconsolate and ragged ruins  the hollow halls hanging stairs and painted chambers present a sad memorial of the fate of their last unhappy lord  this was the possession of the ancient family of devilstons thomas de devilston teety lam de devilston per tertiam partem unius militis sicut praedecessores a temp to conquesti l cell v   p  0  who held it from the time of the conquest for several generations they were in possession in the reign of king henry iii as appears by the escheats of that time it afterward experienced many changes of owners being successively held by the tynedales crasters and claxtons and at length became the estate of the ratcliffs in the reign of queen

structures mark them with solemn beauties an inspection of castles and strongholds in ruins gives the traveller pleasure historic facts arising on his mind fraught with images of the tyranny and oppression of feodal powers now extinguished he rejoices that the vassalage and cruelty which marked those times are no more he regards such monuments as the broken prisons where tyrants held in chains those whom their avarice and love of rapine characterized with the epithet of enemy he looks upon them as the mementos of days of distress when every man formed his greatness by the number of fellow creatures he could harness to minister to his pride and contribute to his crimes as dens of savages and animals of prey who like the wolves of the forest held warfare with all the creatures of the earth and worse than wolves employed the powers of rationality to render them more rapacious more cruel and more bloodthirsty than mere animal instinct could insinuate to the heart even cruelty bloodthirstiness and rapacity against their fellow creatures of which wolves are not accused he looks upon them as monuments of sepultured oppression over which the olives of peace are woven by the hand of liberty he regards them as the hallowed records of all those inestimable jewels which beset the british diadem and enrich the british constitution whose luster strikes the eye of the whole observing world with envy admiration and astonishment  but dilston gives the observer other sentiments tears arise upon the eye for the crimes of men who in opposition to salutary laws for good effects stamp the law with the character of propriety through mistaken principles imbrue their hands in civil discord it is the mistake in principles gives the tears to flow resolute wickedness extinguishes all pity but humanity feels for mans hallucinations for the errors of judgment  for such pity is even divine  another disagreeable reflection wrestles for a place in the contemplative mind on such a view  strange is the rapacity of men who are ready to take possession of the moment of overthrow and with greedy hands seek to share the spoil even of him for whom once they fought of him whom they had loved had served had feared  their patron protector and friend the lower class of mankind have but few estimates to govern their actions whilst prosperity attends you are served you are beloved you are adored take away that and the wretches return to their original ferocity and each endeavors to gain what he can from the ruins  from dilston we made a short ride on the banks of devils water where there are many fine sylvan scenes we gained the western eminence above  nunsbrough where lays the most picturesque though confined landscape the whole county of northumberland exhibits we ascended to the brink of the precipice near  00 feet high from whence we looked down upon a sequestered vale almoss insulated by the brook consisting of a fine level plot of corn land of about eight acres in the exact form of a horseshoe the brook passing over a rugged rocky bottom under the shadow of lofty hills in various broken streams was seen on each hand foaming from fall to fall which gave a beautiful contrast to the deep hue of the groves from the brook the hills to the left arise precipitous clothed with a fine hanging wood then glowing with a full sunshine to the right the steeps laying from the sun and in the deep shade were broken and scattered over in wild irregularity with brushwood and here and there a grotesque and knotty tree presented itself impending from the precipice in front a fine eminence of brown rock lifted its rugged brow and closed the circle dividing the waters with a promontory a few yards wide in the clefts and on the little levels of the rock some shrubs grow on its crown stood ripened corn margined with hedgerow trees through which a cottage was discovered and by its foot a winding road soon escaped the eye in intercepting woods the rays of light fell happily upon the cliffs and brightened their coloring to the right and left the more distant brook showed itself in deep and rocky dells embowered by lofty oaks to the right hand the hill which surmounts the wood is topped with a plain of grass ground on whose brink stands a farmhold accessable by a narrow path winding up the steep from whence the woods make a beautiful curviture the distant back ground is composed of heath lands on the left woodlands were seen on the circus winding on the mazy channel of the brook here and there intercepted by heathy eminences the back ground very distant and tinged with a misty azure to grace the little enchanted vale reapers were busy with the harvest in some parts the furrows looked like waving gold in others they were embossed with upset sheafs this is the finest natural theater i ever saw the circle is almost geometrically just the plain would have suited those exhibitions of which we read with an anxious curiosity in the histories of the ancients they would have given it life taken away the rusticity and made it noble when we descended to the vale below it appeared only to want some of the sacred rites to improve its solemnity and compound the idea of hallowedness with greatness one possessed of a true taste for natural beauties is apt to be wound up to a pitch of enthusiastic rapture at such scenes as these where every subject that can compose a rural prospect are thus fortunately adjusted and disposed it is not possible for me to write with temperance on such a subject  we again returned to hexham an agreeable retreat after our little excursions from the manuscripts of the late roger gale esquire letter from mr robert cay to mr gale of another piece of plate found near hexham    july      sir one of the duke of somersets officers had an antique piece of plate here a few days ago it was said to be found in the river tyne at a very small distance from the place where mr cooksons was discovered i have not had the pleasure of seeing it but from the description given of it i would suspect it to be a patera i am etc  robert cay i send you an impression of a seal lately found at norton near stockton i fancy it to have been the seal of some abbey or abbot can the animal be designed for one of the locusts described by st john in the revelations the inscription round the seal is very fair and plainly isv bab winft adrat        on our next ramble we visited  beaufront an elegant situation on the north banks of tyne commanding a beautiful prospect of hexham plains i have already given a description of this vale therefore to enlarge upon it though tempted by various points of view where its beauties are differently disposed would become wearisome to the reader it must suffice to add that from beaufront the river is seen in several canals and hexham appears crowning the opposite eminence with singular beauty the house is upon an extensive modern plan but as we had not access to it i cannot say any thing of its convenience or taste  mr wallis derives beaufront from bellus locus but for what reason is not shown this was the seat of the carnabys so late as the reign of queen elizabeth it is now the possession of the family of erringtons of errington north of the roman wall william de errington high sheriff    king edward iii sir thomas de errington one of the conservators of the borders    king henry vi sir gilbert de errington a partizan of king edward iv nicholas queen elizabeth thomas  john the present owner wallis   we passed by the herminstreet or watlingstreet leading from the station of corchester to  portgate an opening in the roman wall before described  thockrington was in view in our road to st oswalds it was impropriated by richard bishop of durham a d   0  its first fruits   l    s   d brown wallis vol   p      wallis     it appertains to the sea of york and is one of the smallest prebends of that cathedral  we ascended the beacon hill or mote law about a mile east of st oswalds fortified by a square intrenchment in the center of which is placed a hearth stone used for the fire in times of public danger to alarm the country from thence we had a view of  little bavington the seat of the shaftoes in the time of king edward i in whose family it has continued since that era william shaftoe    king edward i william

beauties the plantations are pleasing and the piece of water from its situation is elegant  we arrived at  st oswalds otherwise called holydenheauveden lel itin vol   p    or heavenfield bid where oswald king of northumberland obtained a singular victory over the british usurper cedwall or as camden has his name caswallon king of cumberland  cedwell flushed with his success over anfred king of bernicia whose army he had lately routed and proud of victory approached oswald with contempt who had gathered together a small body of faithful adherents and lay in a fortified camp prepared to oppose the invader oswald beheld the numerous army of his enemies with astonishment when he compared them to the little band on whose arms he must confide he perceived that was his dependence alone on man the fate of his troops was obvious they would be overwhelmed by the numbers of his foes the propriety and justice of his cause gave him a degree of fervor which denied dismay and over his hitherto unenlightened soul a new spirit of confidence was diffused as he cast up his eyes toward heaven and rejected the idols in whom he had been taught vainly to trust he erected a cross in the front of his army and bending to the earth called upon the name of christ beseeching his mediation with the father of all in whose hand alone is the event of battle that he would establish justice on the face of the earth as inspired he arose and called aloud to his troops as bede writes let us all kneel down and beseech the almighty the living and true god of his mercy to defend us against this proud and cruel enemy bid says no sign do we find of the christian faith no church no altar through the whole kingdom of northumberland to have been erected before this noble leader and conductor of an army directed thereto by faithful devotion did raise the ensign of the cross when he was preparing to fight against a savage and bloody enemy when oswald perceived in his battle the divine aid which he had so earnestly implored he became a professed christian and sent for alden of scotland to catechize and instruct his people in the christian religion  the place of victory was called heavenfield  in camden we have the following ancient dystich quis fuit alcydes quis caesar julius aut quis magnus alexander alcydes se superasse fertur alexander mundum sed julius hostem se simul oswaldus and mundum vicit and hostem  after this prayer he put his little army in battle array his troops being warmed with that energy which devotion gives and which prompts to intrepid actions cedwall advanced arrogantly confident in his numbers and insolent from his victories assuring himself of vengeance on his opposer whom he sought with contempt he attacked the intrenchments and mounted the ramparts in person when a fatal shaft pierced his bosom and laid him in the dust his followers dismayed at the fall of their leader halted  a panic seized them  their swords stayed from assault and as if perplexed by inconsistent commands they began to retire in confusion oswald perceiving the change took advantage of the occasion and instantly rushing upon the enemy in a dreadful onset put them to flight the carnage became horrid the number of slain was incredible and those who escaped the sword were totally dispersed it seemed more than the human hand could effect to obtain so complete a victory had not the interposition of celestial powers confounded oswalds foes oswaldus erat namque filius potentissimi regis ethelfridi cujus pater ethelricus rex cujus pater ida rex a quo ut beda

this event oswald being slain at the battle of macerfield in the   th year of his age fighting against the mercians was canonized a silver coin was found near the place where the abovementioned church was built with the head of st oswald which was used for a long time by the convent of durham as their common seal in honor of his memory there is an engraving of this seal in the appendix to dr smiths edition of bedes church history   in our way to chollerton we viewed a place called  hanging shaws an exploratory mount around whose sides are flights of terraces where the people in arms might at once show their force to an approaching enemy rank above rank and also advantageously defend themselves upon an assault  from thence we had a view of the village of halyton and  halyton mesnes the seat of christopher soulsby esquire  this place it is said was stained with the blood of ethwald king of northumberland who fell by the treachery of syga a nobleman of his court  we proceeded by chollerton having a view of the house of errington with the adjoining tower as we passed up the river on one hand and on the other  haughton castle situate on the western banks of north tyne formerly the possession of the swinburns and widdringtons  this castle is chiefly dismantled some few apartments only remaining habitable among which is one made in an aperture in the wall whose thickness affords a chamber capable of receiving a bed and some other furniture this has been an extensive fabric immensely strong in its structure but now no otherwise remarkable than for those circumstances mentioned and the fine grove in which it stands embowered  we passed the modern seat of mr riddle dukentinus de riddell patricius  walter  sir jurian de riddell   king edward i sir william  high sheriff   king edward ii william  hugh  sir william de riddell of this family who lived in the reign of queen elizabeth was one of the lessees in trust for the corporation of newcastle upon tyne of the manors of gateshead and whycam in the bishopric of durham worth  0000l per annum by dr cradocks computation his seat was the abbey of st edmund in gateshead  wallis sir thomas of this family was a loyalist in the civil wars of charles i and so formidable an enemy to the oliverians that they offered  000l for his head he narrowly escaped them from berwick on tweed  he was great great grandfather of the present mr riddle   which arose from the ruins of  swinburn castle an elegant stone building covered with woods nothing can be more agreeable to the traveller than to observe the improvements of a country and the advances of cultivation mr riddles house commands an extensive view but it is over an open and illfenced tract he is making rapid progress in the cure of this defect and multitudes of quick fences and plantations are arising which in a few years will extinguish the disagreeable traces of that hostility and devastation which before the union marked this country with the melancholy memorials of warfare and in their place give to the eye all the charms of rural opulence  in the reign of king edward i it was the possession of peter de gunnerton escheat   edward i as a member of the barony of bywell held under the service of two knights fees in the reign of king edward ii it was the property of adam de swynburn escheat  0 edward ii and  0th queen elizabeth who leaving a daughter christian it passed by her in marriage to sir john de woodrington of woodrington castle in whose family it continued for several successions  chipchase castle next attracts attention the seat of the late christopher reed esquire as also his predecessor john reed esquire who gave it great improvements its situation is beautiful on a declivity on the eastern banks of north tyne commanding an elegant prospect the river forms a fine canal in front washing a woody steep on this side and on the other the foot of a wild projecting cliff nunwick enriches the more distant view surmounted by symondburn castle the tyne winding through the vale in various meanderings often shows itself whilst woods rocks and heathy eminences in a happy manner mingle their various beauties with the cultivated lands upon the landscape  chipchase according to camden once belonged to the umfrevills it was the possession of peter de insula in the reign of edward i soon afterward it became the inheritance of the herons sir john heron knt king henry viii sir george  keeper of tynedale king edward vi sheriff of northumberland    queen elizabeth killed on the scotch borders      when sir john

wark a small town on the river tyne which has nothing remarkable but an exploratory mount called the mote hill and the ruins of a house of the ratcliffs it was granted in the reign of king james i to howard earl of suffolk and came by sale to the earl of derwentwater and is now part of the possessions appropriated to greenwich hospital  we now prepared to leave the beauties of tynedale the cultivated vale narrowed and we approached to those wild and barren heights which mark the highlands of northumberland with all the characteristics of a scottish desert as we advanced to risingham we passed within view of  bellingham a town seated on the eastern banks of north tyne the estate of the ancient family of bellingham robert de bellingham   king richard ii and   king henry iv richard    king henry vi the family arms three hunters horns sable stringed gules  two parts of the manor belonged to the archbishop of york as appears by the escheats of   king henry v   whose castle now in ruins is near adjoining to the village at hareshaw linn a little way north of bellingham is a fine waterfall breaking through a rugged channel divided by several rocks the whole tufted with grass and shrubs the land on each hand is lofty and shows many shelving rocks and projecting cliffs rendered highly picturesque by impending trees which give infinite beauties to the landscape on the opposite side of the river to bellingham lays  hezleyside on an eminence clothed with wood the seat of the charltons william charlton esquire king edward vi william king charles i sir edward    king charles i

commanding a view of the town of bellingham and a mountainous offscape varied with verdent sheepwalks rocks and wood  we entered redesdale which by the testa de neville is said to be the dominion of the umfrevills who held it by the service of repelling thieves and robbers pleasing prospects were no longer the temptations to our progress we were led only by the love of antiquity  risingham was the habitancum of the romans and lays upon the watlingstreet it is not mentioned in the itinerary of antonine yet must have been a roman station about the time of aurelius antoninus by the inscriptions and coins found there it is situate on the banks of reed and contains within the vallum three acres three roods and twentysix perches of land it is presumed the itinerary was composed in the time of caracalla before which this station might have been deserted near risingham was standing some few years ago a milestone without any inscription dr hunter communicated a coin found here the reverse struck with the figure of a wolf the legends totally defaced except the words augustus pius horsley   camden says risingham implies the giants habitation it is remarkable that in the darkness of antiquity we find innumerable traditions of powerful persons and mighty achievements under the characters of giants which at this time according to mr bryants most excellent work denote some great temple the character of some powerful people some mighty ruler or miserable tyrant camden relates that the inhabitants in his time had a traditional tale of the god magon who defended himself here and maintained his fortress against a certain soldain or heathen prince this relation he says is authenticated as to the reality of such a personage as magon in the ages of antiquity by two roman inscriptions found in the river there from our utmost endeavors we could not trace any remembrance legendary tale or heroic song touching such person as magon now remaining  the inscriptions given by camden are as follow deo mogonti cad et n dn avg m c secvndinvs bf co habita nci primasta  pro se et svis posvit deo mogonti cadenorum and numini domini nostri augusti marcus caius secundinus beneficiarius consulis habitanci primas tam pro se et suis posuit  mr horsley reads the latter part of this inscription prima statione pro se et suis posuit the altar on which this inscription is cut was taken out of the river reed which runs near this station he says this altar camden justly supposes to have been erected to the topical god magon worshipped by the cadeni or gadeni a neighboring people of the otadini and to the deity of the emperor by one secundinus a beneficiarius of the consul reading the two last words of the fifth line primasta for prima statione makes the sense natural and easy risingham is an advanced station beyond the wall and for ought that appears to the contrary might at the time when this altar was erected be the most northerly station of any the name secundinus frequently occurs in gruter  deo mavno cad  inventvs do  v s this altar was also taken out of the river mr horsley says according to this copy it appears to have been erected to another topical and tutelar god of the cadeni it is a question whether mounus may have been the same with matunus to whom an altar was erected at elsdon a few miles from this place or perhaps the same deity is here designed as in the former the third line in the inscription has no doubt contained the name of the person who erected this votive altar we find the name inventus in gruter  i must leave the roman line and attend to more remote antiquity to define if possible the name of magon i presume mr bryant has thrown such happy lights upon the ancient mythology and has proved his principles by such testimonies that with implicit confidence i may adopt his maxims i shall have several occasions to resort to his work in the progress of my journey through the mountainous part of this county for etymologies of those ancient names which without his directions i should have passed over as incomprehensible and so lost in the mists of antiquity as to remain without solution  as it is little doubted fireworship was once the accepted religion of this island introduced by eastern visitants and professed and practiced by the druids in these wild and uncultivated parts it is most probable the strongest evidence thereof would remain to this age i find in mr bryants radicals as he terms them that the word o  on was one of the titles of the sun among the amonians genesis chap xli ver    exodus chap i ver    and was often in combination with other epithets used by the syrians cretans and canaanites he also therein speaks of the word macar as a sacred title given by the amonians to their deity and was frequently compounded macar  on from whence a people were donominated  macarones and places were called  macron the corruption of a name received from the pronunciation of unlettered and ignorant inhabitants who had handed it down traditionally for ages is not to be wondered at from macron to magon is a simple and easy corruption from the inaccuracy of these rude inscriptions as appears in the second even in the name of the invoked deity it is not to be wondered that g took place of cr or from the obliterations in them through age and time the transcriber might mistake  for g a small letter being frequently introduced in the middle of a word take mr bryants arguments on traditions of the like nature and the whole relation given by camden is resolved into an historic fact  that the worshippers and priests of on who held here their religious rites in the temple of the sun were a formidable society powerful in their numbers and their learning  that the eastern religion and rites were introduced to this island is certain that the romans in many instances are known to have adopted the topical gods they also from an error in etymology gave to persons names which were relative to places and when in britain they either introduced their own manner of worship or otherwise adopted the british deities or rather the amonian titles which they found there and gave them persons as divinities to prove this i shall quote the inscription before spoken of in the cottonian collection found at great chesters page    bryant sur being a title of the sun syria being denominated from thence is at this day called souria from sur and sehor the sun that suria was not merely a provincial title is plain from the surya dea being worshipped at eryx in sicily and from an inscription to her at rome  the romans had an aversion to the druids who suffered no idols to be set up they took infinite pains to extirpate them and destroy their monuments here then we find the remainder of camdens tradition that the priests of on the worshippers of the sun at risingham long withstood the roman arms to pacify the people and incite them to mix in their worship the romans erected their altars on the sacred mount and inscribed them with the amonian titles  if i may be allowed to make another conjecture that the topical deities to whom these altars were dedicated prove the worshippers of the sun held here the amonian rites and that from thence was derived the tradition mentioned by camden i would presume this latter inscription was either incorrectly copied having in the original an a and m mixed thus  or the first letter in the name of the deity was omitted by the sculptor or intentionally neglected by the dedicator as appears in many other instances and that properly it should have been amouno amoun being a grecian mode of expressing amon i have before shown from mr horsleys authorities that the grecian expression is used in many roman inscriptions yet extant this altar would then appear to be dedicated to ammon the topical deity of risingham at the time of the accession of the romans for the sake of impartiality it it is necessary to admit that the dedication to ammon might be from grecian auxiliaries as plutarch says that of all the egyptian names which seemed to have correspondence with the zeus of greece amoun or ammon was the most peculiar and adequate and from herodotus we learn that almost all the names of the gods in greece were adventitious having been brought thither from egypt  camden says so much we may gather from these inscriptions as to ascertain the name of the place habitancum and that he who made the first inscription was beneficiarius to a consul and primate of the place the beneficiarius was either by promotion or arising from exemption of military service by dispensation they attended the chief officers of the army they seem to have been somewhat like those we now call cadets horsley and the primaes as appears by the codex theodosii were chief magistrates of cities towns or castles camden leaves us in the dark as to magon not even determining whether he was esteemed the tutelar god of the gadeni whom ptolomy placed next the ottodini  the following inscriptions found at chester hope near risingham have been communicated to me  d m amelianvs annorvm x d  ivliona ni filia vixit ann  s xvi m xi di  xiiii the following is walled up in a house upon the station and reversed it is cut on a stone about    inches square  dolocheno c ivl pvbl  pius trib v s l m mr horsley gives the following reading and remarks upon it jovi optimo maximo dolocheno julius publius pius tribunus votum solvit libens merito this was published some years ago by dr hunter in the philosophical transactions i am of opinion it has been the body or plane of an altar having met with several parallel instances where the capital and bases have been struck off from altars in order to fit them for walls or such other uses the appearance of the stone favors this conjecture and upon this supposition i believe the altar has been inscribed to jupiter optimus maximus dolochenus and that the letters i o m have either been at the top of the plane and struck off with the capital or else upon the capital itself the word dolocheno is very plain upon this inscription but in all other inscriptions and writers who mention this deity the name is spelt with an i or y in the second syllable excepting one which though it be so likewise in gruter yet in petrus apianus who had published it before it is writ as montfaucon observes with an o in the second syllable like this possibly the letters pvbl in the second line may not be another name of the person but stand for publitia the name of the tribe to which this caius julius belonged this tribe is often mentioned in gruter as to the divinity dolochenus i shall have occasion to quote mr horsley very fully on an inscription which occurs at benwell besides the sculptures and inscriptions here noticed in mr horsleys work we find the following appertaining to this station  lxxxiv marti victori julius publius pius tribunus votum solvit libens merito  this mr horsley says remains at the station though i could not discover it and presume it has been moved since his time there are effigies of mars and victory on the capital and an os head on the base of the altar mars has his usual dress and symbols a shield in his left hand and a spear in his right the victory in her usual drapery holds a globe in her right hand and a palm branch in her left the figures and inscription marti victori explain and illustrate each other  lxxxvi militum cui praeest marcus peregrinus superstes tribunus  the original i found placed for a seat at the back door of a house at chesterhope the first word may have been militum and the other letter a c in cvi and as the cohors prima tungtorum has militum annexed i once suspected that this altar rather belonged to the tungrian than the vangiones from the inscriptions at the housesteads in one of which we also meet with the name superstis the altar is of a hard reddish stone but finer than usual  lxxxix  cui praeest nonnuis aurelius castus vetustate conlabium  this seems to be the broken inscription given in camden and before mentioned it is very evident it was erected on the repairing or rebuilding some public edifice that through age had gone to ruin for so much does the usual expression vetustate conlabsum imply aurelius castus seems to have been the name of the praesect but what cohort he commanded that was employed in this work is not to be known by the inscription i can imagine no resemblance between the first letters in the inscription and those in gallorum or vangionum and yet there is no evidence from any inscription of any other cohort being there the n in the word conlabsum is silent as it often is in the middle of a word before another consonant and so is frequently omitted by the workmen who usually wrote as they were accustomed to pronounce  xci dis manibus  vit annis   of which little more can be known than that it has been sepulchral  xcii there is nothing more worth our notice within the station but the following sculpture three human figures are on one side and a man holding a horse on the other side of the same stone which is of a cuical form these figures are much effaced the man who holds the horse on his left hand appears to be in somewhat like an armenian dress with a hasta in his other hand two of the other figures are leaning upon pillars one of which has a staff in his right hand with two serpents twisted about it the symbol of esculapius whose image i take it to be and the short figure which stands next exactly agrees to telesphorus the god of recovery who is always represented in this manner with a cloak covering both his arms and is often placed between esculapius and his daughter hygicia and sometimes standing by esculapius alone in both cases he appears like a boy he stands with esculapius alone in a medal of caracala and between him and hgieia in the medals of lucius verus and philip the younger as also in a sculpture of montfaucon the god and goddess of physic and health and the god of recovery are proper companions one of another the third figure here may be hygieta with the calthus about her head the drapery is very doubtful and the serpent her usual symbol does not appear in which the sculpture agrees with that of montfaucon a man holding a horse may be an emblem of victory peace or security in a medal of commodus with fortunae manets on the reverse fortune sits holding a horse by the bridle there is so great a resemblace between this fourth figure and that of castor upon some coins that it has created an opinion in me that it may have been intended for castor or geta under that figure holding his llaus in his hand if the habit be set aside which is very obscure how exactly does ths answer to viseass account of a coin of getas where he is represented in the figure of castor in a military dress holding a spear in his left hand and leading a horse by the bridle with his right the figure here indeed holds the spear in his right hand and the horse in his left but that is no material difference castor is usually distinguished from his brother by a horse according to horace  castor gaudet equis ovo prognatus eodem pugnis but montfaucon has given us a sculpture of castor and pollux together each holding a horse and a spear  two inscriptions in mr warburtons map of northumberland whose originals i could not find are thus represented fortvna avg ael procvlin v s fortunae augusti aelius proculinus votum solvit i suppose this has been an altar the e at the end of

about half a mile north from risingham close by watlingstreet lies an altar much of the same size and shape with that at risingham which stands in the gate of the station it has a praefericulum and patera on one side and a garland on the other there has no doubt been an inscription upon it though now not the least sign of a letter appears i think this cannot well be the same altar which with the inscription upon it dr hunter has described in the philosophical transactions for the doctor says he found that near riechester the inscription the doctor has given us runs thus d m c ivl fl ingen

where caius julius make two of them though mr ward there also chooses to refer one of the names rather to the tribe     in camden we find the following inscriptions avr antoni ni pii avg m messorivs diligens tri bvnvs sacrvm mr horsleys reading and remarks on this inscription are as follow aurelii antonini pii augusti marcus messorius diligens tribunus sacrum the original was removed by sir robert cotton for it still continues at congton the upper part has been broken off and the first line now remaining is partly covered by being built up in the wall of the summer house the rest is yet very plain there is no doubt but pro salutae imperatoris m has gone before and perhaps the altar has been to jupiter optimus maximus or to jupiter and the numina augusti it is not easy to determine to which of the antonines this inscription belongs if this station was in ruins as some think in the reign of caracalla the supposed author of the itinerary then the inscription could not be to him besides the titles felix etc are usually added to him and in our british inscriptions he is often joined with severus after whose death he immediately left the island m aurelius antoninus called philosophus had wars here and his legate calpurnius agricola is named in an inscription or two in these parts and i am apt to think that both this inscription and some others in the north belong to that emperor  nvminib avgvstor coh iiii gal eq fec of this mr horsley gives the following reading and remarks numinibus angustorum cohors quarta gallorum equitum fecit the original of this is also at conington and placed above the summer house door the sculpture has suffered by the weather but the inscription is still very legible the emperors in honor of whom it has been erected i take to be severus and caracalla who were much hereabout and i believe were possessed of this very station this cohort seems to have been like a flying squadron for by inscriptions we find them in several places the inscription is included in a kind of corona or rather an octagon circumscribed by a square moulding there are ornaments of eagles heads on each side above which is the appearance of two faces probably designed for those of the emperors referred to by the inscription mars and victory in their usual dress and appearance are set in a nich one at each end of the stone the other ornaments seem only to be such as pleased the fancy of the sculptor the victory treads on a globe and no doubt the general meaning is that the emperors had warred successfully and gained a victory over the whole world  deae ter tianae sa crvm ael timothea p v s ll m of this inscription mr horsley gives the following reading and remarks camden has given us the name of another topical goddess in an inscription

very entire and is i think one of the largest altars i have seen that are so beautiful on one side is an ox in basso relievo on the other an ornament not unlike a curtain for i could not say it was a

gate of the station but is now used as a gate for the field when i was informed of this altar i was told that a great many more letters were formerly visible upon it it has been a fine altar but is now turned upsidedown so that the capital was hid in the ground it is not improbable that the inscriptions and altars dedicated to hercules have been designed as a compliment to the emperor commodus who as it is well known was called hercules romanus besides this julius paullus i find three other tribunes who commanded this cohort of the vangiones  d m blescivs diovicvs filie sve vixit an i et

which there are other instances  icoscvipre  m avrl cast  vetvstate conlabs  this station was certainly gone to decay before the reign of caracalla and afterward was restored and this opinion is favored by the last imperfect inscription found at this place from whence it appears that somewhat had been repaired which had gone to ruin through age  the remarkable effigy of robin of risingham as it is called by the country people next claims my attention i will in the first place give mr horsleys description and then offer some few remarks of my own the remarkable figure which usually goes by the name of robin of risinghom or robin of redsdale is cut upon the face of a huge piece of rock that has fallen off from the main one it is on the side of a hill or rock near the park head and about half a mile from the station at risingham the image is in basso relievo and both the sculpture and stone very coarse i take it by the drapery and symbols to be certainly roman though some from the rudeness of the sculpture have thought it british and probably it is the emperor commodus represented under the figure of hercules the square stone beside him must i suppose be an altar and what he carries in his left arm a club on his left shoulder are distinctly seen a quiver and arrows and in his right hand a bow which agree with the character given him by herodian who celebrates him as a most excellent archer what he wears on his head looks like a helmet every body knows that commodus affected to be called the roman hercules and to be worshipped as such we have his coins with herculi romano augusto herculi romano conditori etc this figure then might represent the roman hercules triumphant and victorious after things had been settled in britain by pertinax and commodus assumed the name of brittanicus the face of the whole piece of rock on which the image is cut is an irregular figure of five sides the side which rests in the ground is six feet and an half the perpendicular from the vertex to this side eight feet the two sides to the right of this perpendicular each of them five feet the uppermost side to the left seven and the lower four and the stone is just about six feet thick the figure stands upright  the doubts which i entertain that this is roman work are founded upon the following circumstances the vest in which the figure is habited is open from the waist to the knee round the waist is a belt buckled before the loose garment on the shoulders leaving the right arm bare and at liberty is put on in the manner of the scotch played the cap is not similar to any one i remember to have seen in roman sculptures the bow is in the right hand but that the reader may pass his own judgment upon this sculpture i have given an etching of it  if we descend to modern times we will find several personages distinguished by the name of robin of redesdale one of the umfranviles had that appellation and in the time of edward the fourth we find one hilliard of the lancastrian party thus denominated from banbury the northern men under the conduct of robbin of riddesdale hist england a d      hastened to the manor of grafton where the queens father then lay whom with his son john they suddenly surprised and at northampton cut off their heads    before i quit the neighborhood of bellingham i must notice the remains of a castle situate near the confluence of the brook tarset and north tyne i did not view the place the description together with a drawing was communicated to me by my friend at newcastle it stands within the lordship of tarset and has the name of tarset castle camden says it was a castle of the comins the area is of an oblong square in length about   0 yards defended by a deep fosse near  0 yards in breadth on the north west and south sides the east laying on a steep descent at each corner of the area appear the remains of turrets or mounds there seems to have been an outward wall to defend the tower  near to risingham is  elishaw

whose stars infatuate him to engage in the labyrinths and wilds of such a country  elsden is a small town of antiquity supposed to have its date from the time of m aurelius antoninus two roman altars were found inscribed to that emperor in a hill called the mote hill mr horsley gives us the following inscriptions found here bonogeneris hvman impe rante calpvr nio agricola avg pr pr posvit ac dedicavit c a acilivs   this was removed to durham where it now is it is very curious and the remark is just which the ingenious dr harle made when the altar was first dug up that the lines which are wanting had been evidently struck out with a tool which is usually observed to have been practiced on revolutions in the empire or upon the persons falling into disgrace who is mentioned in the inscription this particularly is thought to have been done with relation to geta by the order of his brother caracalla in some other inscriptions in britain though i cannot think that the name of geta has been upon this altar for this neither agrees with the letter c yet very plain and visible nor with the sequel of the inscription which is very clear and distinct bono generis humani imperante calparato agricla legato augustali propraetore posuit ac dedicavit cius als acilius the first words in the filth line are undoubtedly augustali propraetore which makes it certain that legato and the name of the lieutenant have gone before according to the usual form if we suppose calparuius agricola to be the name that has been designedly erased i believe that as the letters will exactly fill up the empty space so that supply will suit very well both with what goes before and what follows imperante calpurnio agricola i take to be the same with s calpurnio agricola or perhaps fussu calpurnii agricola which so frequently occurs in such sort of subscriptions there is some difficulty in forming a notion of the meaning of an altar erected bono generis humani but this may seem as intelligible as an altar erected bono sato bono eventi etc and perhaps has much the same meaning there are coins with salus generis humani upon them if the conjecture concerning calpurnius agricola be admitted it will then follow that this inscription belongs to the time of m aurelius antoninus whose legate this agricola was and consequently that the romans were in his time possessed of this station  having given my own sentiments of this inscription i must acknowledge that a different conjecture has occurred which several of my friends incline to prefer and that is that the following fragment and this may have been originally but one stone and that the whole inscription has run thus deo matvno pro salvt et  bono generis hvman impe rante geta avg svb    leg avg pr pr posvit ac dedicavit c a acil deo matuno pro salute et bono generis humani impe rante geta augusta sub    legato augustali propraetori posuit ac dedicavit caius aulus acilius but i do not think it probable upon reviewing them that both the fragments have been parts of the same stone  we have here the local deity matunus concerning whom i can learn nothing more than his name     this mount is entrenched round the mote yet

bottom a large stone rough and undressed lad upon the ground in form of a gravestone with smaller stones wedged in between it and the ground wherever there were any interstices when this was taken off there appeared  the ground a cavity in form of a grave about two yards long and four feet broad at the top about a foot and a half deep was some very fine mould next to that some ashes said in fine white sand the sand was above two feet thick the whole depth of the cavity or grave being near four feet there were mixed with ashes what they took for small pieces of burnt bones very black but no entire bones there were several pieces of burnt wood like charcoal i have not yet seen the place myself but i have this account from an eyewitness who examned every thing very carefully i design to go

achievement sought for young henry percy who for his intrepidity and martial prowess was surnamed hotspur he met him in the hottest of the battle insolently braved the young hero to engage and douglas fell beneath his valorous sword the rumor of their leaders overthrow ran through the scottish lines they were intimidated and began to fly but at the instant the panic was becoming general and the english were advancing in hopes of victory the earl of dunbar came up with a large reinforcement and the scots rallied now overpowered by numbers and faint with the fatigues and bloodshed of the fight

support the english before they had left the field to the victors the scottish leader not willing to hazard any more of his troops thought it expedient to use stratagem and accordingly assailed the reinforcement in a mode totally new and happily prevalent he caused all his soldiers to blow the horns which were used to sound an alarm the stilness of the night the echo from the hills and the terrors which the overthrow of the northumbrians had impressed upon their minds wrought so powerfully that the militia were seized with a panic and put to flight without seeing an enemy vanquished

ruminated on the subject of descent from heroes and illustrious personages men who had acquired fame honor and title by virtuous deeds and a service of propriety i determined that the pride of pedigree was laudable so long as the descendant did not debase his blood by ignoble and impious actions i admitted it as a maxim that such had a right to public place preeminence and distinction then it was i took as it were the other hand into consideration a review of the modes of the world and thence proceeded to compare my determined principles with characters well known to me i remarked many who claimed place and distinction and stand up as the givers of modes and rulers of what shall be called propriety of manners such a groop of characters crowded upon me the mushrooms of a morning all rushing with ardour and avariciousness of mind to the goal of preeminence wretches sprung from the filth of a corrupted age that their mimick importance created in my mind so ridiculous a picture even

northumberland it was esteemed the strongest station the romans had in the north and was the capital or chief fortress of the otadini c caepio charitenus and lucius caelius optatus commanded here the

notitia we meet with tribunus cohortis i hispaniorum axeloduno in the netherby inscription we have tribunus coh i acl hispanorum eq i think we have not met with any former instances of the title aelia ascribed to this cohort mr horsley page    conjectures that the cohoris prima hispanorum equit might be part of the ala herculea but i believe sir if he had met with this inscription he would have thought otherwise in the notitia as he observes p    we do not meet with the expression cohors equitum but as in many parts of that book the place of the officers residence seems chiefly to be intended i know not whether we ought always to suppose that the whole body under his command was in the same place therefore i am more surprised that we never meet with tribunus coh equitum among the stations per lineam vli there is none said to be commanded by a praefectus alae which appears to have been much larger than some of those where tribunes of cohorts are placed and i know no instance of a commander of an ala styled tribunus i would therefore suppose that an equstrian cohort consisted of two alae though it might not be very common to mention them as cohorts and perhaps the ala prima herculea and the ala vettonum might compose this cohort  sir yours etc robert cay   an answer to the preceding letter by mr gale london   th december      mr horsleys reason for supposing the cohors prima hispanorum to have been part of the ala herculea is their being quartered nearly together the first at elenborough and the other at old carlisle as appears by inscriptions found at those places  i believe this cohort arrived in britain with the emperor hadrian and continued there till the romans quitted the island and in a series of about  00 years it must have made several marches and counter marches from one camp to another my reason for thinking it came hither with that emperor is from its appellation aelia and its country spain the latter of which might prevail with him who was a spaniard by birth to dignify it with one of his own names and when he transported the legio vi victrix into britain he might bring this cohort among the auxiliaries that were joined to it this also inclines me to think it was part of one of the alae belonging to that legion which seems always to have been employed in the north and to have had its head quarters at york  the legionary alae consisted of several cohorts of foreign auxiliaries though of how many is uncertain sometimes we are told they were equal in numbers of men to the legion and sometimes that they exceeded it it is therefore probable that both the alae of a legion might contain ten cohorts the number of those that constituted a legion when complete  i cannot therefore agree that the cohors prima hispanorum was composed of two alae the   herculea and the ala vettonum since alae were formed of cohorts and not cohorts of alae  ala also imported a large independent body of horse and of this sort seems to have been the ala vettonum and the ala prima asturum the ala sarmatarum etc all which carry the the names of the countries they originally came from  the legio vi victrix was in britain when the notitia imperii was compiled as were all those ala it is not therefore unlikely that the ala i herculea and the ala sabiniana were the wings properly appertaining to it one so called from the emperor maximianus herculeus the other retaining the name of the empress sabina or sabinia either the wife of the emperor hadrian that brought this legion into britain or of the emperor gordian the third who honored the other wing of it with his own name which is most probable because from the name sabina the appellative adjective sabinia would be properly formed and from the name sabinia wh  empress as appears from her medals the true formation of the adjective thou e samara  when the titia as it now stands was wrote the legio secunda augusta was withdrawn from  wales its long and ancient quarters to richburrough in knt and the aiane that composed the wings of it were in all probability the forces that garrisoned the stations upon that coast against the saxons as the wings of the vlth the horse of a legion was in the aae the body  so that the wings were the properest to  the country  whi the main body lay in  defended the northen borders against the scots and ts while the main body of that legion lay in its head quarters at york the britons when the romans abandoned this island and for many years before were entirely friends with them united in the same interest and almost the same people so that they had no occasion to keep any troops upon the borders of wales but rather to withdraw them ad lineam vai to defend their friends and confederates against the barbarians on that side and to the  on the other to protect them from the depredations of those  for a that time they were no more it is very strange i must own that no  have been found in any of these eastern and southern station and so many of them in the northern i can impute it only to the long residence of the roman forces in the north with many  peace and ase which gave them leisure to erect temple altars and  glandeur there and to a short stay upon the saxon coast in coast in continual a arms that gave them time to think of nothing but the defense of themselves and country and all the remain of their fications and castles in thse parts speak them to have been of the lowest empire  upon this occasion give me leave to observe that the notitia imperit has given you the state of the roman government and forces in britain not as they really were when that account of them is supposed have been compiled at the latter end of thos the seconds reign about the year     but as they stood in the year  0  or  0  when the aforesaid legions were t  it is evident they had been recalled before that time when the legis secuda gta left  not so  but i think we may safely determine that the legio vi v forsook us when st drew together all the forces of the empire to his assistance against alari the  which was about the year  0  from the following verses of the poet gla ve a extremis legio praetenta britannis qur sent dat fraena tuci ferro notatas pe eras res picta moriente figuras which is such a defer of this len and its employment that i think it puts what i have conjectured upon its departure out of doubt as we have no mention at that time of the second legion nor afterward it was probably recaed before the sixth so that what the ntitia gives us of the romans in britain seems to be copied from an account taken at a time when they had a flourishing civil power and a good army residing here and not to relate to the latter end of tdosius the second a time of the utmost confusion and disorder when they were not able to defend their own  and their roa eterna against the ravages of the goth  but to return the commanders of both sorts of alae were led praefecti the same title as commanders of legions were honored with and to be a praefectus alae more interest was made than to be a praefectus legionis as being more profitable and sooner attained by rising quarter tt through the several degrees of military promotion but the proper title belonging to the commander of a coort seems to have been tribanus the notitia imperis constantly lng them so though that title is not always observed in the inscriptions where we find frequently  the true name was probably tribunus and praesectus as a title of a greater dignity only a compliment to the officer as we call all our lieutenants and ensigns at this time captains  cohors was properly a company of foot turma a troop of horse the commander of the latter was rightly called decurio and frequently praesectus cohors equitata milliaria centurias x coh eq quingenaria centurias vi peditata mill centur x etc vide hyginum de castramet et schelii commentaria in io xo these romans antiq graevii like the captain of a cohort vegettus a late author and who lived a little before the notitia was compiled tells us that the first cohort of a legion was called milliaria that it consisted of   0  foot soldiers and     horse that the other cohorts had only     foot and    horse that the commander of the first cohort had the title of tribunus and that those of the other cohorts were styled either tribuni or praepositi at the emperors pleasure other authors differ as to the number of men in a cohort and i never met with a praepositus cohortis in any book else or inscription perhaps it was a late distinction and but just brought into fashion when vegetius wrote  however in imitation of the first legionary cohort it is not improbable that the first auxiliary cohort consisted likewise of above  000 men and the rest of more than  00 the  th and  th it is said were above  00 whence they were called quingenariae as the first was milliarta and i think the inscription you sent is a strong proof of this conjecture the note there being the character of  000 in number and consequently the last words of it are to be read  tribunus cohorts primae aeliae hispanorum milliariae equitatae and not equestris or equitum as used by pliny and other polite writers equitata being the camp word and not denoting a cohort consisting entirely of horse but a cohort formed partly of foot and partly of horse as is evident from hyginas de castrametatione who wrote expressly upon that subject and in the military style  sir yours etc roger gale   extract of a letter from sir john clerk to r gale esquire edinburgh   th october      i know very well that the first cohort of a legion used some times to be called milliaria for so rosinus and vegetius and before them modestus had taught me i know it consisted both of horse and foot but i thought it a tautology to add after prima cohors these letters  eq wherefore i imagined that there was more intended viz directly to signify that the whole cohors consisted of horse in number  000 or that there was belonging to the cohors  000 horse who were quartered at netherby but what was of greater weight with me was that i believed that in the latter times of the roman empire there were cohorts entirely of horse pliny in the tenth book of his epistles and i think the  0 th epistle furnished me with a direct proof of this for he expressly mentions the sexta cohors equestris there was another proof occurred to me from the   th chapter of suetonius in vita claudii where cohos is mentioned inter equestres milites in the main i thought it would do as well to read the letters  eq mill equitum as to call the cohort prima milliaria i pleased myself also with the fancy that if the old lipsius had seen this altar he had acquiesced in the above cited words of suetonius and not have read them semestres militias some of your editions of that author will direct you to a squabble amongst the critics upon the reading of those words which in my apprehension this very altar at netherby may decide but be the reading what it will it pleases me to think that there were spanish horse amongst us in former times which perhaps contributed not a little to that breed of horses which is in those parts to this day i believe the jockes will not approve of this conjecture we generally attribute our breed of galloways to spanish horses though we carry their origin no farther back than the spanish invasion in      and the ships which were cast away on our coasts but this is an episode i can easily pass by  i have only now to add a conjecture of mine as to the apparent streets in the town of netherby viz that they were stables for horses and of this very kind there are several in the station at middleby nothing was fitter than horse to defend them against my old countrymen the fugaces caledonii  i am etc j clerk   extract of a letter from mr john horsley to roger gale esquire   th april      sir the have lately converted a part of

remember in one of your letters you were so kind as to foretell that i should one time or other find out the true reading of an inscription discovered at lanchester in the county of durham i confess i was never so much ed to pect you to be a false prophet on any other occasion and yet now i believe that contrary to my own expectation you will be found a true one even in this i have been at the expense of bringing the altar to morpeto on which the inscription is to which i refer this has given me in opportunity of setting the one broken piece of it on the other and examining the whole inscription with the greatest nicety and care by this means i have discovered the remains of a letter or two which had escaped me before and now i read it jovi optimo maximo vexilat ctio perhaps primae vardulorum equitum or equestris votum solvit libentissime merito this reading which seems to lie pretty much out of the way i have found out by the help of another lucky discovery i mean a stone found not long ago at riechester which i have also got into my own possession a draught of which and the fair and beautiful inscription upon it i have sent you enclosed as also a copy of that at

be usually wrote with a g at the beginning are two neighboring people in spain the form of the expression in the lanchester inscription i suppose to be parallel to the biturix cs in one at york i see no reason why varduli cranei may not pass as current as cubi biturges which we have both in pliny and the aforesaid inscription i think templam or temple and solt or some such words are most likely to be those which are wanting at the end of the two last lines  i am sir urs etc john horsley   an answer to the preceding letter by roger gale esquire sir   st december    0 a letter from you is always extremely acceptable since it never fails of bringing its entertainment along with it i never pretended ex tripode loqui and if i should my responses would have no more weight than those of the oracles always dubious oftener false than true i am much afraid what you charge me with in your last will come out wrong though your conjectures are very ingenious as you have communicated them to me i doubt not but you will give me leave freely to send you my thoughts upon them  as for the o m they can have been nothing but the remains of jovi optimo maximo and perhaps what follows is the remains of vexillatio though i am not without my scruples as to that in the first place i do not remember i ever met with such an inscription as vexillatio cohortis or cohortium though frequently with vexillatio legionis which i take to imply a detachment sent off from the legion under a vexillum where we meet with those vexillationes leg ii vi xx upon the wall in scotland  secondly vexillatio equitum is generally taken for cohors equitum but as there might be a detachment from a cohors upon occasion as well as from a legion i will not insist upon that vardulorum is very plain upon this altar though a name hitherto unknown in britain i wish the cranorum was as much out of dispute for though the or that follow vardul are the initials of that word yet i cannot think they belong to vardulorum as you read them because we find but one nation of the varduli in spain and consequently no occasion of the additional cranei to distinguish them from any of their neighbors that might have the same appellation pomponius mela expressly says the varduli gens una in france were two nations of the bituriges the one therefore was called the bituriges cubi the other the bituriges viisci as for the cranei upon the riechester ne i shall show you by and by that it is quite another thing to this i am obliged to add that i cannot find among my old geographers such a people as the cranei or granei in spain or any where else therefore should be glad to know where you met with them  in the riechester inscription which is indeed very beautiful the word soc in the first line is certainly proecio gruter p xxii    gives us an inscription dim et soli socio which is read deo into matrae et soli socio the compliment is paid to the emperor in yours by giving him the sua for his companion as

least   0 miles from the confines of the varduli now the province of cupuscea in the bottom of the bay of biscay in the very eastern parts of spain with several nations interjacent so that they cannot be said to be people not far distan one from the other and i never imagined they were your cranei till the receipt of your last letter these cranei never have as yet occurred in any inscription more than my consecrani but that is warranted by julius capitolinus a good author and by a just and proper signification of the word concurring i believe you cannot produce any phrase in author or inscription parallel to tribunus cohortis i vardulorum cum commilitonibus craneis suis allowing even cranei to have been the name of a people whereas the other reading is plain and easy and though julius capitolinus lived after the age of this inscription several years that is no proof that the word consecrani was not in use before he wrote it was a military expression and little used perhaps out of the camp i hope you will pardon the freedom that has been extorted from me by a conviction of my being in the right as to this criticism and am  sir etc r gale   mr horsley to roger gale esquire sir morpeth   d january    my absence from home was longer than i designed and since my return have been prevented examining originals till this morning this has occasioned a delay of the fuller answer i intended and promised i received the riechester inscription just before the press came to the other inscriptions belonging to the same place and having no great fondness for an appendix i immediately dispatched to london some short observations on it in order to their being printed and inserted in their proper place so that before i received your first letter it was too late to make any alteration there however i must beg leave to take notice of your conjecture either in the preface or some other proper place mr ward intends a letter to me by way of review of all the observations and there is a proper space left for that letter in order to its being inserted at the end of the observations on the second book of the britannia romana this letter will be instead of an appendix there is no notice taken of this in mr wards letter but mr horsley in all probability reprinted his observations on this inscription see his brit romans p          r g and any new discoveries and thoughts will i believe be there inserted i shall communicate yours to him on this occasion unless you rather choose to speak to him yourself though i have not wholly abandoned my first conjecture yet i have a good opinion of yours and no doubt considering how natural it is to have a partial regard for our own offspring yours will have the preference much more in the esteem of others  i have carefully and impartially examined all the letters on the stone and am convinced that the last visible though imperfect letter in the  th line has been an n which favors your opinion i have with my compasses compared the breadth of this letter with that of all the ms and ns on the stone and find that it agrees pretty well with the stated or usual breadth of the n but always falls sensibly short of the breadth of the m this ought to have been regarded in the copy though whether it be or not with sufficient accuracy is more than i am sure of the addition of se at the end of the line would bring it to an equal length with most of the rest nor have i in this review observed any thing on the stone which is in the least unfavourable to your opinion on the whole i strongly incline to think you must be in the right and that my own conjecture must have the honor to be overthrown by so good a hand as your own and the lanchester inscription reduced to its primitive state of confusion and darkness  the remains of the letter at the end of the last line but one may be those of a c but are likest those of an o the shape and position will by no means allow it to be the top of an s it is thus dec but more perfectly round than i have here drawn it i have compared it carefully with the s the c and the o in the inscription and find that it suits the last best may do for the second but not at all for the first  to save the seeming unnecessary repetition of the word deo i was at first sight thinking of deones and believe have mentioned that conjecture in my observants but how it may

true description of its site it being placed on the brow of a steep and rocky hill or rather as camden calls it a rocky mountain commanding the pass of reedsdale on every hand the prospect is horrible

places the plain marks of fire the same appearance which i observed on another of these stones found in this place the letters of the inscription are well cut and all of them that remain are still very fair and distinct only a piece of stone is broken off at one corner which cannot yet be retrieved and with it a small part of the inscription is lost the addition of socio to incto soli deserves a remark soli comitt is frequent on medals and i imagine soli socio to have much the same meaning the antonine for whose safety this was vowed must have been either commodus or caracalla commodus was the first who assumed the conjoined titles of pius and fli but then in inscriptions to him there is usually some other distinguishing title whereas the form of the names here is such as is usually ascribed to caracalla this suits well enough with the conjecture of his being the author of the itinerary and with the assigned roman limits at the peace of severus and caracalla since it appears from hence that riechester the undoubted bremenium was possessed by the romans in the reign of caracalla and by the erecting this new temple that they had no apprehensions of being soon dislodged from this station though probably it was then the boundary the inscription was erected by luctus caecilius optatus tribune of the first cohort of the varduli the great distance between the g and the l in the fifth line that is between the last letter of the emperors name and the first of the tribunes is very remarkable the varduli were a people of hispania citerior situated not far from the west end of the pyrenaean mountains there are another people in hispanta citertor usually named grovi or sometimes gronii at the first sight of this inscription i concluded that graneis must be the name of the same people for c and g are often interchanged and granei or granii looked like the name grovis or gronii and as i apprehended bid fair to be truer than either i therefore read cum commilitonibus or contubernalibus granes but i now with pleasure resign this conjecture for a better of the learned and sagacious mr gale which he imparted to me in the riechester inscription says he which is indeed very beautiful the letters soc in the first line are certainly for socio gruter p xxii gives us an inscription d i m et soli socio which is read deo inicto mithrae et soli socio in the riechester inscription the complement is paid to the emperor by given him the sun for his companion as this in gruter associates him with the god mithras and as he appears upon the medals of constantine and others with the legend soli invicto comiti there is no further difficulty till we come at the sixth line where the cohors prima varduloram shows itself beyond exception the cum con i read with the beginning of the seventh line cum consecraneis the word consecranei devoted to the same service or engaged in the same cause is not very common but we have in julius capitnus gord c    sacrati commtone mo etiam corscranei i e ejusdem sacramenti militaris participes than which nothing can be more apposite since the receipt of this letter from mr gale i have reexamined the original and am convinced that it has been an n at the end of the sixth line for the breadth of the letter which may certainly be determined from the visible tops of both the vertical strokes is exactly the same with the breadth of the other ns in this inscription but sensibly less than the breadth of any m in the whole the imperfect letter at the end of the seventh line seems to have been an o though the repetition of the word deo appears harsh and uncommon if we could suppose it to have been a c mr gale would read decr pvb for decreto publico as it is probable that last line has concluded with the usual s l m so unless we suppose temp for templum with which votum agrees to have stood at the end of the seventh line there will be no room for it at all temples were frequently vowed as well as altars and we have one remarkable instance more in this collection of a temple pro satute domni divinae this inscription also gives us a certain discovery of a new auxiliary cohort in britain and

breasts are two rude circular lines and the eyes two such holes the nose and mouth are expressed on the stone by three cross cuts he seems to have a patera in his left hand though figures in a sacrificing posture generally hold it in the right  xcvi silvano paneo pro rani tribuni et laculae eus eychus libertus consulis votum s likens merit  this and the following inscription together with several coins have been lately dug up at riechester this altar was found near the northwest corner of the fort with the face downward the first words in it are plainly sivano pantheo it is common now to give the name of pantheus to the figure of any god who has the symbols of other gods joined with his own and in some inscriptions panthe is spoken of a particular god thus we have in gruter signum panthei testaments feri and signum pantheum sua pecunia d d as also panthe aug likewise hereculi mercurio et silva rum et o pantheo and dion informs us that drilla was called parthea from the variety of divine honors that her brother caligula ordered to be paid to her after her death a late ingenious friend conjectured that the expression silvano pantheo might denote the whole groupe of silvan deities faunique satyrique et menticelae silvani f conque deos umbosaque silva feranque ru haet   the altar has been erected for the safety of rufinus the tribuni and his wife lucilla by ethych a freedman of the consul this rufinus no doubt had at that time the command of the garrison here and s different both from the tribune mentioned in a forgoing inscription and in that which follows  a conjecture arises that pantheos is compounded with the latin name pan and theos greek de and this is in some degree supported by the grecian declensions used in the foregoing inscriptions  xcvii pa ae franu tribanus  this inscription resembles the centurial kind and contains nothing material in it but the name of the tribune eras it was found near the western rampart of the station not far from the spot where the foregoing altar was dug up  several of the coins found lately at this station were of marcus aurelius this confirms to us that the romans were about that time possessed of this and the neighboring stations and makes it more probable that the artonine mentioned in an inscription at risingham might be marus aurelius and that calparnius agra his legate was the person whose names have been erased out of the inscription found at esdon it is the observation of the great mr aan that one finds as many figures of the excellent emperor marcus aurelius as of all the est together   will appear by comparing the description given of it by camden two centuries ago with its present state there are hills hard by so boggy and standing with water on their summits that no horsemen are able to ride through them and again mountainous desert and impossable such as this tract is  camden preserves this inscription d r s dvpl n explor bremen aram institvervnt n eivs c caep charitino trib v s l m deae romae sacrum duplares numeri exploratorum bremenii aram instituerunt numini ejus caio caepione charitino tribuno votum solverunt libenter merito  mr horsleys remarks on this altar are as follow the original was removed to connington the plain and distinct mention of bremenium upon this large altar does strongly argue riechester to be the place the implication and proper cut of the letters which is neglected in camden i have endeavored to supply from the original no body that i know of has given a satisfactory explication of the d r s at the top i think it plain that they are to be read deae romae sacrum that they made a goddess of rome and erected altars and temples to her needs no proof to those who have any acquaintance with medals and other roman antiquities there is a curious altar at elenborough erected genio loci fortunae reduci romae aeterne etc i once thought of diis romany sacrum but this suits not with numini ejus in the body of the inscription for which reason the learned dr gales reading deabus rumabus sacrum cannot be admitted the altar then is sacred to the goddess rome erected by a duplares of a detachment of exploratores or scouts at bremenium under the command of caius caepio charitinus the tribune caepio is a consular name and we read in the notitiae of a praefectus numeri exploratorum lavatris whether they were the same with these i will not undertake to determine the duplares were soldiers who had a double allowance of corn of which a part of the roman soldiers pay consisted the exploratores were like our scouts sent out to discover the enemy or their country when they were in garrison it is probable they were generally placed in the more advanced stations or such as were most conveniently situated for prospect and discovering the first approach of the enemy as also for guarding the passes against their inroads  camden adds that ptolomy speaking of bremenium places it in this very site and part of the country and from thence antonine begins his first journey in britain as from the utmost limit of the roman province at that time when the barbarous nations had broken through the wall of antoninus pius and would in consequence hurry over and lay waste all the country before them the wall of hadrian laying neglected to the time of severus we may necessarily admit that this station was regarded as the limit of the empire from whence the old itinerary which bears the title of antonines began viz a limitis the construction given it to imply a vallo is only a gloss put on it by the transcriber  mr collier communicated to me the drawing of the following sculpture and inscription lately found at this station and now in the possession of the rev mr jolly it never was published he informed me it was found near the eastern entrance into the station is about four feet nine inches in length and two feet three inches in breadth    mr wallis says there is nothing more worthy of remark by the alpine streams of reed and north tyne i wish i could have been as readily transported from riechester to wark as i transmit the reader on the feathers of the gray goose wing we did not pursue the reed any further northward though informed that near to bridhope crag a little above riechester there are two large square entrenchments with two openings on every side each defended by an outward mole of an oblong form at the distance of six yards from the aperture the description given of them shows they are similar to the large entrenchment on stainmore at roy cross vide excursions to the lakes in westmoreland and cumberland where a plate of that entrenchment is given which is attributed to the english under william the conqueror on the defection of cumberland and northumberland who were supported by the scotch monarch  nunwick the seat of sir lancelot allgood which appears so beautiful from chipchase is equally pleasing upon a nearer approach the house is modern of a fair freestone sheltered from the west by a fine grove and seated near the confluence of symondburn with the river tyne it was formerly the possession of the herons of chipchase was sold by sir harry heron to robert allgood esquire whose heiress married the present owner a descendant of the brandon white house family  wallis from the eastern terrace a delightful prospect opens commanding a fine view of chipchase on the one hand and the variegated vale of symondburn on the other the banks of the stream are romantic and wild and the wastes which terminate the prospect are at an agreeable distance  near nunwick some years ago were the remains of a monument by most writers termed british consisting of five natural stone pillars placed in circular order near eight feet in height and twenty feet in girt the area which they formed was ninety feet in circumference whether the interstices were heretofore filled up with stones of a smaller size to compose a circle which on the advance of cultivation were removed we have no evidence bishop gibson only speaks of them as in the state described i have great doubt whether this was a temple or place of convocation of the druids or not i am rather inclined to believe such as are composed of a small number of stones are danish monuments and memorials of some public act of that people where the circle is uniform the column to which it is conceived the victims were bound is perfect or to be distinguished and the recess forming the sanctus or place of the altar is remaining like those in cumberland and anglsea it is not to be doubted the druids were their constructors that they were their places of convocation and as every public act of those lawgivers was preceded by holy rites and sacrifice it may with propriety be said they were places formed for a mixed appropriation for acts civil and religious  symondburn is placed on a fine eminence but has little that is remarkable to detain the traveller symondburn is remarkable for being the largest parish in the diocese extending northward from chllerford bridge to liddesdale in scotland a space of    measured miles in which are only two chapels of ease bellingham and falstone  the old rectoryhouse was built by mr allgood grandfather to sir lancelot the following inscription still remaining over the entrance in memory of it much injured by the weather non tam sibi quam successoribus

near this place lies the body of the revd mr major allgood m a rector of this parish eldest son of lancelot allgood esquire escheator for this county of northumberland lineally descended from john

left by will dated   d september      for the relief of the poor of this parish the maintenance of a school master at wark and the binding cut the poor children apprentices his trustees purchasing after his death the estate of tecket adjoining to the rectory glebe now let for    l per annum  wallis the rectory is one of the most valuable in the north is presented to by the crown and was formerly the possession of lord derwentwater the church has lately been repaired and retains no other remarkable monuments than those mentioned in the notes  in march      as the workmen were pulling down the old kitchen of the rectoryhouse a square stone was discovered nine or ten inches each way but the inscription was obliterated at one end occasioned as one may suppose by the workmens tools either when they built or pulled down the kitchen the letters are three inches long it may possibly be in the possession of dr scot the present rector as it was in that of mr wastell the late rector in      mr horsley takes notice of vlpivs and sabinvs two roman lieutenants sent against the britains but says he never heard of any inscriptions found relating either of them    in the monasticon we are told king edward taking displeasure at anthony beck then bishop of durham dismembered this church from that see it was afterward in the possession of the darcys in the reign of king edward iii john darcy at his death left it to queen philippa who gave it to windsor college  mr wallis speaks of a remarkable scull dug up within the walls of the church on the back part of it was the figure of a large scallop shell at one of the auditories the figure of a torcular shell like a screw it is surprising no naturalist has attended to this wonderful phenomenon mr wallis himself i should have apprehended would not have left this great curiosity so slightly treated of he does not even say whether these impressions were sculptured or adhesions of petrified matter in either case it would have gratified the virtuoso to have had a perfect description we read of that degree of wantonness and inhumanity that the sculls of enemies at public festivals were used for drinking cups was this ornamented with sculpture it would lead to an apprehension it was once employed in such unhallowed rites if these were petrifactions it would still be more wonderful  this introduces to my mind a hasty idea of petrifactions being esteemed a testimony of an universal deluge it has been insisted upon by many learned men but the discoveries hitherto made in that branch are in no wise convincing moses had his learning from the egyptians mr bryant has amply displayed their knowledge of that great event i dare not make strictures on that learned work but opinion is fond of liberty all the petrifactions i have seen in the various collections do not prevail to fix my judgment in favor of such testimony in the first chapter of genesis we see the grand work of creation classed in six progressive orders in the figures of eastern language it is given under a diurnal arrangement by such expression i presume we are not to be confined in our idea of the work to those short periods the works of providence are wonderful to the highest degree in a course of nature why should we render them still more miraculous and less credible by holding to the very letter of the book of genesis without giving a latitude to the expression so much of miracle and so little of reason in modern dissertations occasions much infidelity we see plainly the work of the divine architect was progressive let us presume each day means an age in which by a natural and progressive course the fruit tree yielding fruit after its kind whose seed is in itself might arrive to its maturity from the original stamina the great creator ordained in the beginning it was not till the third era that the dry land appeared all before was deluged here is a period then in which all those substances which we find have left their testimony in petrifaction might rest upon the highest hills when at the command of their god the mountains heaved themselves up from the bosom of the deep the shifting of vast sands the falling of mighty precipices rent by earthquakes mining in various countries and eruptions of volcanoes have brought to light those materials which are lodged very deep in the earth and yet none of them have produced any evidence of the destruction of the human race by petrifactions of parts peculiar to mankind their implements or utensils of which gold would not decay erections or other memorials of their antediluvian existence to enter at large into this disquisition would lead to a separate work it shall suffice at this time to say that if there were no other testimonies existing than petrifactions to prove this great event we should still depend upon implicit faith concerning it to return  the church of symondburn has two dependant chapels bellingham and falston the parish is between thirty and forty miles in length extending to liddesdale in scotland there is within this district between falston and the extreme boundary an extensive tract of country where till within the last century conversion had scarce reached or the benefits of religion and the rites of the english church been promulged except in the collection of tithes  symondburn castle was demolished by the country people in vain researches for treasure a small part was lately repaired with two angular turrets as an ornamental object on the landscape  we now took the road to rothbury the first object that attracted our attention after passing the seat of mr riddle was a tower on a lofty eminence commanding an extensive prospect appertaining to mr delavals estate of bavington the edifice ugly to a degree  we approached  bavington the ancient familyhouse of the shaftoes william shaftoe    king edward i william    king edward iii william    king richard ii alexander   king henry v william   king

now the seat of sir edward swinburn this mansion was formerly of the castle form and leland says was a fair building moted round the present house is built in the taste which prevailed in the time of

edward married the daughter of sir henry lawson of brough in yorkshire and had by her thirty children of whom eighteen arrived at maturity wallis page       many roman antiquities have been discovered here of which mr wallis gives a particular account   a sympullum silver    oz this was a cup used in sacrifices    bottoms of three others    handles of three with beautiful figures in relief upon one the bust of an emperor two smaller figures one a shepherd holding a crook in his left hand with sheep by his side the other a poor man looking toward the emperor in a supplicating attitude his body bending and resting on a staff with both hands on his back a burden in the middle of the handle is a winged mercury sitting with a caduceus in his right hand his left grasping a ball inclining on the seat a cock under him crowing at the bottom diana in a loose robe a spear in her right hand her left rested on her hip a dog looking up to her silenus naked to the feet holding a bunch of grapes in his right hand and a nymphaea or water lily in his left with a canthera or jolly flagon by him swelling to the brim with the juice of the grape on another handle a lion a stag and a wild boar slain for sacrifice on the third a priestess before the altar sacrificing holding incense in her right hand and a thyrsus in the left above her head the bust of an emperor bearded    part of a handle whereon is the figure of mars in armor a flamin before the altar of a temple in a grove sacrificing    a figure of hercules and antaeus wrestling finely executed the lions skin and club laying by them    a neptune naked to the waist in a reclining posture holding a trident in his right hand and an anchor in his left  in the time of agricola the romans wore beards not customary from the    th year of the city till the emperor hadrian  wallis he says they were found about a mile from the roman causeway and seem by the workmanship to be as ancient as the time of agricola  within view of capheaton are the cliffs of  harnham this place takes its name from the hermanstreet or military road it was a strong fortress defended by nature on one hand with rocks of vast height and on the other by a morass there was no approach to it but by a narrow pass on the north defended by an iron gate easily maintained part of the present mansion consists of the remains of the old castle and stands on the brink of a vast precipice this was the mansion of the babingtons a family as ancient in britain as the conquest and of colonel babington in the reign of charles ii governor of berwick his first wife catherine she was the widow of colonel george fenwick of brinkburn and eldest daughter of sir arthur hezelrigge of nosely in leicestershire bart by dorothy greenville sister to robert lord brook  on a

june  th    0  wallis was under excommunication for contempt of an ecclesiastical sentence on which account she was not entitled to sepulture in consecrated ground to prepare for her interment a cave was hewn in the rocks of harnham below the foundations of the castle where her remains now lay in a leaden coffin  it is a disgrace to a polished and enlightened nation that such a court has existence but to a state professing the rights and religious tenets and enjoying the liberty of britain it is infamy a court where in despite of the right of trial by juries property is disposed by arbitrary sentence and where the grossest acts of inquisitorial iniquity are daily practiced such as private examination of witnesses and suppression of evidence and yet this scab upon the constitution remains uneradicated  sir john babington of the harnham family acquired the crest and motto of his coat armor by a desperate service under king henry iv in france on his own petition he was one of six young knights sent on this duty and on his leaving the royal presence he brandished his sword and exclaimed foy est tous the crest a dragons head from the mouth the words foy est tous proceeding the pulleines of carlton in yorkshire intermarried with this family and at carlton hall is a pedigree beautifully illuminated   belsay castle the seat of sir william middleton was next in view it is built on an eminence part of the old castle remaining this was part of the family possessions in the time of king edward ii the boast of pedigree and honorable connections appertains to the middletons but it is not pertinent to my work as that of an itinerant to enter upon the field of the herald otherwise in this family and that of the babingtons there is sufficient matter to blazon an hundred pages

race and derived royal blood from king william i  mr wallis in his notes gives several letters from king henry viii to one of this family on public duties but none of them afford any light to history or import any special matter of consequence     on our gaining the summit of the eminence the country opened upon us beautifully we now looked down upon the rich vale where wallington stands extending toward the southeast to a great distance terminated by a view of the sea the country before we gained this situation was for some miles unpleasant little planted and ill cultivated but this prospect recompensed all the fatigue the eye had endured in the sameness of the preceding passage on the left hand  little harle the seat of gawen aynsley esquire presented itself surrounded with wood this was one of the manors of the barony of prudhoe and appertained to the fenwicks   king edward vi by the escheats of the  0th of queen elizabeth it appears then to have become the possession of the aynsleys of shaftoe in the depth of the vale we passed  kirk harle the seat of sir william loraine a pleasant retirement it was one of the manors of the barony of bolbeck and the possession of sir robert de harle in the reign of edward iii but soon after became the property of the family of loraines from a little pamphlet printed at newcastle    0 being an account of the genealogy of this family it appears that robert the first of this family in england came over with william the conqueror for his services in that expedition and in the incursion of malcolm king of scotland in the sixth year of the reign of william rufus he was rewarded with several large estates in ufferton east middle and west harrington in the county of durham and free fisheries in the river were he was a distinguished scholar and was the author of some learned works  the descendants of robert resided in the county of durham until the reign of king henry the fifth when william lorrain by marriage of johanna the eldest daughter and one of the three coheiresses of william del strother of kirkharle tower became possessed of the manor and ancient mansion house of kirkharle from which time the family residence has constantly been at this place from william lorraine by johanna his wife descended edward  married elizabeth daughter of john harding esquire of hallinside in the county of durham and died in the reign of king richard iii robert his son  married margaret daughter of robert bows esquire of the county of durham he was slain by the moss troopers william his son  married agnes daughter of sir

margaret the sister of henry lambton esquire of lambton in the county of durham sir william his son    one of this house robert loraine was slain by the moss troopers near his own mansion in memory of which a pillar was erected  we advanced to  wallington the seat of the late sir walter calverley blackett bart and now of sir john trevelyan his nephew and heir this was one of the manors of the barony of bolbeck and the ancient possession of the greys in the reign of edward ii it was held by one of that family called john usually styled john de wallington it afterward became the inheritance of the strothers by marriage of the heiress of robert de wallington from the strothers it came to the fenwicks by the marriage of john fenwick of fenwick tower with maria the third daughter and one of the coheiresses of william del strother and remained in that family from the reign of king henry iv till sir john fenwick sold it to sir william blackett in the reign of king william iii sir john de

king charles ii representative in parliament for the county of northumberland  sir john executed on tower hill   king william iii         wallington house is a handsome stone structure but from the mode of architecture does not seem to take its date in this century before the south front is a pretty pasture ground inclining to the brook of wansbeck at the east front is the grand approach having a circular coach road with a beautiful green plot parterres and flowering shrubs plantations and covered walks close it to the north and conceal the offices the gardens seem well disposed on a warm inclination and the whole makes a pleasing rural appearance without any intrusion of costly ornaments and labored works in the whole composition there is a degree of taste mixed with a countenance of rusticity which characterizes an agreeable retirement nothing is so displeasing to the eye as temples pagodas columns pyramids gothic banquettinghouses and modern ruins jumbled into a few acres with that confusion and want of taste which overloaded opulence often disgorges round a modern villa true taste is attached to nature so intimately that each disposition by art must be made to heighten her beauties not to distort her and overburthen the scene with a progeny adopted from all the quarters of the earth a bad situation cannot be changed nay it is not even improved by gorgeous works a load of edifices is only like finery on a deformed object  but dispose the works of art in a just adaption to the situation and in the mode pointed out by nature and they grow into elegance  the nearer prospect from wallington over the vale is rich to the southeast the view is extensive though not much variegated in a clear atmosphere the sea is visible from thence at the extreme of a level not less than twenty miles in length  in entering these demesnes the benevolent character of the late owner instantly occurred to my mind what dreadful instruments are greatness riches and power in the hands of tyranny and malevolence but what blessings do they not pour forth from the good and wise how detestable is authority under some characters which it would be invidious to name but how lovely is power in the possession of others such characteristicks have marked the life of this man as will immortalize his memory and as he eminently possessed whilst living so will fame transmit to futurity his name and virtues accompanied with the universal love of mankind he died in the  0th year of his age without issue the title is extinct he represented the town of newcastle in seven succeeding parliaments viz                               and      and served the office of mayor in                     and      was the oldest member of the house of commons   the inn beyond wallington on the rothbury road at  cambo commands a fine view of the vale we had passed the ascent for more than a mile is gradual and the road in a direct line from wallington so that the hedge rows form a vista terminated by the dome of the offices which has an agreeable effect the prospect here is extensive and noble some coalworks to the right deform the nearer ground but all beyond is of that happy composition which cultivation mixing with natural woods and fanciful plantations give the landscape object decreasing after object and stretching from the eye till mingled in the azure of the atmosphere in which all the horizon lay softened and blended  cambo the name derived from the camp or sort on the hill  wallis was the seat of sir robert de camhoe in the time of king henry iii  the way from thence to rothbury is very crooked and by cross roads rendered perplexed about wallington we saw some guideposts but in few other places in the country and several of those having been painted were obliterated and only mocked our anxiety many bridges give easy passage over the brooks but their flanks are suffered to be walled up or closed so that the traveller is deprived of the necessary refreshment for his cattle the carts were passing unmarked and their drivers insolent to a high degree  we had a view of rothbury castle at the distance of some miles the situation appeared rugged and uncommon on the side which then presented itself we could discern distinctly no more than the square tower and part of its flankings placed on a considerable eminence of a rocky and barren aspect by not taking the proper road we were led almost round this edifice which we viewed with no small degree of impatiency when we came to look upon the northern front our curiosity was somewhat slackened but nevertheless we passed down the road about half a mile and having climbed the fence ascended the steep to the building the fatigue was but ill recompensed for we found this object of our anxious curiosity no other than an ornamental structure composed of a square tower flanked with a curvated wall embattled and pierced with loopholes and each wing terminated with a bastion the situation romantic on the brink of a broken precipice the sides of this hill to the west and south present a shaken and tremendous rocky steep rent into vast impending columns and massive tables the stones of enormous bulk in many places hang on each other in such loose positions as if ready to fall into the vale forming caverns and recesses and rude heaps of rocks of a most wild and grotesque appearance to decorate i presume this noble scene the awkward images of a goat and a staring stag delight the passing children  on resorting to my book of notes i find they carry the countenance of peevishness but as they are just i will transcribe them the southern front opens on a small plain naturally of a circular form scattered over with huge heads of griffins broken cornices and ensigns of calverly the lamb and flag of grace sculptured on white freestone in the midst of which stand two preposterous effigies representative of no known dress personage or people and to give the coup de grace to this composition enormous ribs jawbones and members of a whale are fastened to the walls for decorations we entered the tower in which by way of tables are three large rude unhewed stones one in the center and one in each recess at the sides benched with similar stones pretty enough for the reception of thomas of hickathrift or jack the giantkiller  we had from this plot one of the most extensive views in northumberland eastward we overlooked the vale which opened upon us at wallington on which many gentlemens seats were scattered mingled with woody plots  very remote objects give little pleasure to the eye except what it derives from the diversity of coloring  the sea formed the distant horizon to the southward we had a view of cambo and the hills beyond wallington with mr delavals tower the deformity of which might now be forgot for the agreeable obelisk it gave to the prospect from hence the western view was more confined but wholly cultivated and the north frowned in rocks mountains and barren heath in descending the hill a curvated canal presented itself margined with young plantations on whose border a tent was pitched this was one of sir walters retreats the family being there we did not visit rothly house  we passed codgey crag a stupendous cliff crowned with another uncouth ornament in the style of the former  it is remarkable in this passage to rothbury in many parts where we could view a tract country for the distance of three or four miles all consisting of cultivated land the farmhouses were so very distant and the inhabitants few that for miles we did not perceive a human being in the whole circle the fields did not engage people in tillage and the roads were almost without passengers so that a stranger at midday might wander far from the way leading to the place of his destination before he could correct his mistake where tillage is neglected and large farms are thrown into grass it must be the case the country is depopulated the industrious labourer cannot procure bread and an engrossing farmer in a state of indolence grows opulent by his herds etc at the loss to community of those members of the commonwealth in whom the strength of the nation consists who are by a deplorable necessity driven to emigrate an event which will at once sap the state and impoverish the subject boys who would otherwise have been employed in husbandry are bound out to manufactories our manufacturers are grown more numerous than trade can maintain the husbandmans labor is not wanted his hands are shifted to a different employ and the hardy race of britons are sunk into a state of imbecility and reduced to the languid and meagre shadows of men who hang upon the loom the difficulty of recruiting the army and manning the navy will every day increase  the resources are taken away not onefourth part of the number of families are employed in husbandry in the north there was forty years ago this was a nursery for the army and the fleet the enlarging farms and reducing the tillage is a capital error which though slow in its consequences yet is as sure as fate substituting the horse for the ox in husbandry is a mistaken maxim which for a temporary profit has crept in upon us the ox was advancing in value and increasing the supply of the market as he labored the horse takes twice the maintenance consuming a vast portion of grain and his price is sinking yearly into nothing not exposing the necessaries of life in open market is another matter that prejudices the poor by increasing prices an artificial scarcity is thereby much easier to be effected i am bold to say that if a law was made to oblige plowing by oxen and to enforce every article of the farmer to be brought to open market to be sold within a limited time we should experience much greater plenty of my own knowledge wheat when  s  d the winchester bushel in immense quantities has been kept up till spoiled and made fit for nothing but hogs i cannot avoid adopting mr pennants sentiments on a view of the like kind speaking of his entry into northumberland at cornhill he says all this country is open destitute of trees and almost even of hedges for hedges are in their infancy in these parts as it is not above seven or eight years since they have been introduced  the land is fertile swells into gentle risings and is rich in corn it is miserably depopulated a few great farmhouses and hamlets appear rarely scattered over the vast tracts there are few farms of less value than   0l a year they are generally three four or five hundred and i heard of one possessed by a single family that even reached twentyfive hundred in this was a single field of  000 acres and which took  00 bolls of seed wheat of six winchester bushels each a humor fatal to the commonwealth prevails over many parts of the north of flinging numbers of small tenements into a large one in order to save the expense of building or perhaps to avoid the multiplicity of receipts lay a whole country into a sheep walk these devour poor mens houses and expel the ancient inhabitants from their firesides to seek their bread in a strange land i have heard of a character i forgot the spot it curses that is too barbarous and infamous to be overlooked which has so little feeling as to depopulate a village of  00 souls and to level their houses to the ground to destroy eight or ten farmhouses on an estate of  000l a year for the sake of turning almost the whole into a sheep walk  there he lives and there he may long live his own tormentor detesting detested by all mankind wark and learmouth once considerable places are now scarcely inhabited the last formerly a great market town is now reduced to a single farmhouse the inhabitants have long since been dispersed forced to exchange the wholesome the vigorous the innocent lives of the rural oeconomists for the sickly shortlived employs of manufacturers in birmingham and other great towns where disease and often corrupted morals cause double the consumption of people as would happen were they permitted to enjoy their ancient seats the want of laborers begins to be sensibly felt as a proof they are retained by the year and policy dictates to their employers the affording them good wages each has his cottage a a piece of land gratis and a shilling a day in summer and tenpence in winter i call this good pay in a country which ought to be very cheap if not what are the fine effects of the great improvements the spectator speaks much of the deserts of the man that raises two ears of corn where one grew before but who will point out the man who has the soul to make his poor brethren feel the happy effects of his art i believe that at present there are numbers who have raised ten for one that were known a few years ago it would be natural to suppose that plenty would introduce cheapness but till the providential plenty of the present year corn was exactly double the value of what it was    years past yet the plenty of money has not been found doubled by the poor manufacturer or labourer the land owner in the north has taken full care of himself a farm of   l per annum  0 years ago has been lately set for    l another of   0l will be soon set for  000l per annum an estate was bought in      for   00l it consisted of    0 acres of which   0 have been sold for   00l and all these improvements result from the unprincipled and iniquitous notion of making the buyer of the produce pay not only to satisfy the demand of the landlord but to enable the farmer to make a princely fortune and to live with a luxury the shame of the times they have lost the respectable character of the old english yeomanry by too close an imitation of the extravagant follies of their betters  the oxen of these parts are very fine a pair has been sold for   l the weight of one was     stone the mountain sheep are sold for half a guinea a piece the lowland ewes for a guinea the weathers for a guinea and a half the best wool from    to   s the stone of    pounds and a half  we now approached  rothbury the whole country in view consisting of rocky steeps lofty hills crowned with heath and others composed of nothing but naked stones a mountainous and rugged prospect dreary and desolate the breez which broke up the vale from the northwest afforded us the true effect which under the descriptive phrase of howling in the wilderness had heretofore conveyed to my mind an image rather poetically extravagant than true but here it was justly descriptive for as it passed over the naked steeps and rugged cliffs its sound could not be described by any other expression  we descended into this desolate vale down a very steep and stony road barrenness and rocks on every hand but on passing a little projecting eminence were agreeably surprised by the opening of the hills and it was not long before we had a sight of whitton tower and soon after rothbury presented itself seated in the neck of a narrow cultivated glen a situation perfectly sequestered and secure from storms some pretty fields opening to the southwest where the valley is enlarged  this is a small irregular town on the river coquet without any thing remarkable but its situation the pedestal of the font in the church at rothbury is worthy observation  the stone is not exactly square at the bottom where it appears intended to be fixed into some foundation stone two opposite sides are    inches in breadth the other    inches but where the sculpture begins the edges of the stone are taken off the work in bass relief on the west side is about    inches long and    inches broad and i presume represents our lord sitting in judgment the principal figure has lost its head but holds a scrol in the left hand on each side is the figure of an angel kneeling and below them a crowd of heads lifted up some hands clasping books others elevated or laid upon the breast the other sides contain rich ornamental sculpture of fancy figures interwoven with foliage such as are seen upon the obelisk in bewcastle churchyard in cumberland from their similarity some people have presumed they were works of the same date   it has a market on thursdays and three annual fairs on whitmonday   st september and thursday preceding allhallows day this was the barony of roger fitzroger baron of warkworth and clavering in the reign of king john with which he held a free forest with all its appendages except the goods of felons which at that time was so beneficial a perquisite as to merit a reservation in the royal grant it remained in that family till the last lord clavering granted it to the crown in the reign of king edward i king edward iii gave it to henry lord percy and it is now part of the possessions of his grace the duke of northumberland  we were led to view a natural curiosity as it is termed called the thrumb which is almost a mile from the town  a cut formed by nature in the rocks of the rivers channel where the stream for about   0 yards is pent in such narrow bounds that a man may leap over  not at all curious or worthy our attention little preferable to a millrace but here we had the misfortune to meet with an impertinent drunken innkeeper whose overofficiousness and loquacity led us out of the way  another remarkable circumstance befell us here on obtaining change for a piece of gold from a neighboring shop the money was so lately and so unskilfully prepared that on turning it over the quicksilver stood in globules upon it the metal was chiefly copper  we set forward for wooler having our minds furnished with disagreeable ideas which our fellow creatures too often excite vices and frauds have access to the most sequestered vales for such were first inhabited by outlaws and robbers  in the neighborhood of rothbury to the east is a circular entrenchment called old rothbury formed on an eminence with a double trench and rampire of earth one of those strongholds to which the inhabitants were obliged to retire on the incursions of the scots used as guardhills on the establishment of a night watch before the union of the two kingdoms wallis   about three miles

were consolodated by richard kelloe bishop of durham by his deed dated nono die februarii anno domini      at the desire of lord richard unfranvill who entering into holy orders had the cure thereof there are no remarkable remains of the priory at the dissolution the revenue of the house was valued at   l  s  d by dugdale and   l  0s  d by speed  harbottle castle lays about a mile to the westward in the year      it was demolished by the scots but aftewards restored this was part of the possessions of the unfranvills of pruddowe they held harbottle by the service of keeping reedsdale free from thieves and wolves under which they also held the castle and manor of otterburn as appears by the testa de nevill this service was adjudged to be in great serjeantry and in the   th year of king henry

formidable fortress sustaining a desperate attack from the whole body of scots on their incursion in the year      who after laying before it two days were obliged to raise the siege it was of some consequence in the reign of king henry viii being the place of retirement of margaret she was daughter to king henry vii mother to king james v grandmother to queen mary and great grandmother to king james the sixth of scotland and first of england queen dowager of scotland his sister on her marriage with the earl of angus lady mary douglas her daughter was born here      this castle at present is totally in ruins  we now returned to rothbury and took the road to whittingham  four miles of our way lay through as barren a country as i have yet seen in this tract there was neither human or brute animal to be observed sheep or goats if such there were hid themselves in the dells which ever way the eye was cast mountains bogs rocks and heath composed the prospect the road was rough and full of stones the ground on each hand broken and grown with heath and the waters which ran in a thousand channels were red with their metalick quality a lassitude and impatiency took possession of the mind and we traveled with displeasure but happily for us the vale of  whittingham lay in our way an extensive rich cultivated valley where every object was highly pleasing after the sad contrast nature had cast in our passage the fields are well fenced with quicksets the soil luxuriant the crops of corn standing in sheafs were rich to the highest degree the meadows finely verdant the houses well built and roofed with tyle the roads open the sheep and cattle of a large breed and every object wore the countenance of opulence on inquiry we were surprised to find  s an acre per annum was the average price for land there the husbandry we remarked was modern and improved this happy vale was near four miles wide in the part we crossed it in our way to wooler  before we descended to whittingham we

chimneypiece in sawing which from the block a live toad was discovered therein the nidus where the animal lodged as it was disagreeable to the eye by order of the late earl was filled with cement we enquired after this curiosity but the housekeeper knew nothing of it we saw a painting of this phenomenon subscribed to which were the latin stanzas given in the notes heus stagyrita tuo si velis quod

quod vides sai obits lucem lithote ni dedere manus vivo bafom  the toad if as large as represented in the painting was wonderful indeed for size as well as its existence being near as big as a hat crown it is not possible to look upon this object without giving passage to some reflections of the following order  how wonderful are all the works of providence but how incomprehensible is the existence of this animal  shut up in the bosom of a mountain cased in a rock of marble perhaps an hundred feet from the surface living without air or such only as should pervade the veins of this stone existing without other diet than the dews which might pass through the texture of marble deprived of animal consolations without light without liberty without an associate of its kind in the newspapers of  0 i recollect to have read the following paragraph a letter from suer and says a few days ago in a coalmine near this place a large toad was found a  a solid coal near 0 feet under ground on being exposed to the air it instantly died it deposited here when the matter which enclosed it was soft and before it gained its consistency as marble how many ages ought we to number in its life for multitudes of years must have passed to reduce any soft substance in a course of nature to the state of this stone one may ask why did it not perish in the universal wreck of animal existence and at what age of the world were these mountains of marble first formed the inquiry leads to a maze of perplexity like the ingenious mr brydons inspection of the stratas of etnaean lava all adopted chronology sinks in the view and years are extended on the age of creation beyond every thing but chinese calculation  in chillingham park are still preserved a breed of wild cattle called the white scottish bison it is said they cannot be tamed having so remarkable a fierceness in their nature mr penant in his tour in scotland and voyage to the hebrides p  0  under the title drumlanrig gives the following description of them in my walks about the park see the white breed of wild cattle derived from the native race of the country and still retain the primaeval savageness and ferocity of their ancestors were more shy than any deer ran away on the appearance of any of the human species and even set off at full gallop on the least noise so that i was under the necessity of going very softly under the shelter of trees or bushes to get a near view of them during summer they keep apart from all other cattle but in severe weather hunger will compel them to visit the outhouses in search of food the keepers are obliged to shoot them if any are wanted if the beast is not killed on the spot it runs at the person who gave the wound and who is forced in order to save himself to fly for safety to the intervention of some tree  these cattle are of a middle size have very long legs and the cows are fine horned the orbits of the eyes and the tips of the noses are black but the bulls

nevil gray esquire   king george i wallis   this is a deplorable part of the country for a stranger to be benighted in the heavy vapors which frequently envelope the hills the whole day as frequently attend the advance of night into the vale as it happened to us and brings on a darkness truly to be felt whilst there there is no house inhabitant or passenger for miles to direct your way  we were thankful when we gained sight of the inn at wooler haugh the courtyard which we descended into from the road was crowded indeed with wagons and carriages and the lights in the stables showed there were several guests in the house but of what quality and denomination we could not divine when we alighted the hostler looked to be in some confusion but we did not devise the reason being willing not to premise any thing to our disadvantage at that time of night in the rain and in a country not known to any of us we were met by a jolly hostess at the door who desired us with all the courtesy of a civil publican to walk in we were introduced to the kitchen and required to air our clothes till the people got lights and prepared a room it was now time to consider the scene the kitchen smelled rank of cooking for there was as much bustle as if they were preparing a hecatomb the room was populous to a degree for the mistress and two jolly nymphs her daughters stickled in the cookery whilst there went backward and forward in and out hostlers livery servants carriers and savages of various denominations in the utmost confusion carrying seeking fetching or calling for innumerable matters like the confusion of babel in the greatest agitation and emergency when we had leisure to think we were at a loss to conceive what had occasioned this hurricane in which we had so awkwardly involved ourselves at this little house under a hill in the wilds of wooler but outward objects embarrassed all thinking to that degree that our minds remained overwhelmed in what the eye communicated or what distracted the ear and like fellows that were fascinated we forbore to make our escape the table was covered with mangled joints of victuals above us before us on this hand and on that was the noise of tumultuous companies creating that discordance of sounds which distracts an inn at a fair  hallowing laughing ringing of bells beating on tables menaces oaths female titterations and music were in the composition my companion in a whisper says where the devil have we got to i would have told him if it had been in my power i found myself totally embarrassed till at length this horrid discordance rouzed me and on expressing uneasiness at not being shown to our apartment we were told the room was clearing of its present possessors who were going to bed startled at such intelligence we began to doubt what would be our accommodations and that we might have occasion to displace the same race of visitants a second time before we could possess any beds in defiance of the weather a night as dark as erebus and a road unknown we thought it more prudent to set forward for wooler town distant near two miles and accordingly left this place to the sportsmen who occupied it on their moor shooting parties and to the carriers and horrid wretches who barricadoed it without  at the black bull inn in wooler we ended the anxieties of the evening in comfortable lodgings and every accommodation a traveller could hope for  wooler is a considerable town holding a weekly market on thursday and two annual fairs on the   th of april and  th of october mr handyside who had a premium of  0l  0s from

escheats of king henry iii afterward it came to the greys of wark and is now the property of the earl of tankerville on a circular mount near the town are the remains of a tower apparently as ancient as the time of the muschamps by the escheats of the reign of king richard ii it appears there was an hospital here dedicated to mary magdalen in the neighborhood of wooler are several intrenchments and kairns one at a place called cattle well which has the name of maiden castle and another a very considerable one at trodden gares  wooler is situate to the east of cheviots in an ill cultivated country under the influence of vast mountains from whence it is subject to impetuous rains it is a place of great resort in the summer months for invalids to drink goats milk or whey the church is placed on a fine eminence and having been lately rebuilt is commodious it is said the mother church was at fenton on the east side of the river till now totally in ruins  our amusement in the succeeding morning was among such hills as have seldom been thought accessable by parties of pleasure by humbledon burn on an easy inclination is an intrenchment called green castle and on humbledon hugh about a mile to the northwest of wooler is a circular intrenchment with a large kairn the side of the hill is cut in various terraces rising above each other this seems to have been calculated for a temporary fort and the mode generally practiced in ancient times in this part of the country many of those terraces are formed with great exactness about  0 feet in breadth in some places there are three of those flights or terraces in others i observed five placed in regular gradations one above the other these were outworks of an important nature to defend a body of chiefs or a valuable booty which occupied the crown of a hill the original mode i presume was danish though those works are properly attributed to the scotch and english before the battle in   0  the summit of a hill being levelled i conceive received the officers of highest rank and the most valuable effects of the camp to which the platforms rising above each other and encircling the hill when filled with troops would make a powerful defense  in the plain beneath is a stone pillar denoting the ground where  0000 of the scots under earl douglas in the reign of king henry iv on holyroodday   0  had a great overthrow by henry lord percy and george earl of march douglass forces had possessed the eminence but his passage into scotland being intercepted by earl percy he was obliged to engage on this plain the battle was so bloody that the lands gained the name of redriggs from the slaughter with which they were stained according to hollingshead among the prisoners were the earls of fife murray angus athol orkney and monteath the lords montgomery and erskine and about  0 knights douglas received five wounds and lost an eye being hotly pursued in the flight  00 scots were drowned in tweed the most of their army on this fatal day dying or being prisoners  the disposition of the english was chiefly on an opposite mount to that occupied by the scotch except their archers who were arranged on the plain the scots were so galled by the flights of arrows to which we may presume they were extremely exposed if marshalled on those terraces before described that they grew impatient of restraint and with their whole force descended into the plain to come to closer battle the english also advanced their archers retiring in well compacted bodies to admit the other troops into the line at the same time discharging such flights of arrows as no armor could resist and thereby the scots were soon broken and thrown into confusion sir john swinton and adam gordon several times rallied flying parties and renewed the battle with the greatest bravery till they fell among the slain historians mention no person of note on the side of the english who was slain that day the victory being entirely the work of the archers the other troops being said not to have engaged  we arrived at  yevering now a mean village and little regarded by travelers though once a place of royal residence  near this place the scots were defeated on magdalenday in the third year of the reign of king henry v      by sir robert humfrevil then commander of roxburgh castle and the earl of westmoreland then lord warden of the marches the place of this action is denoted by a rude stone pillar    feet high harding says that sir robert umfranville who had at that time the keeping of roxburgh castle fought at geterying this year with the scots on madelyn day   d july umfranville had but seven score spears and  00 bows with which force he discomfited  000 scots and chaced them    miles into their own land he took   0 prisoners and slew  0  hard c       in bid we have the following passage paulinus coming with the king and queen into a manor or house of the kings called adgebrin at this day yevering abode with them    days employed wholly in catechizing and baptising during which time he did nothing from morning but instruct the people resorting to him in the saving word of christ and being thus instructed he baptized them to the forgiveness of their sins in the river of glen which was hard by this house was in the time of the succeeding kings neglected and another made for it in a place called melnim now melfold  thus it appears this was a manor of the saxon kings and was the residence of king edwin and his queen ethelburga after his conversion by paulinus this edwin was afterward slain by penda and cedwall two tributaries ethelburga escaped to her brother eadbald king of kent by whom paulinus was made bishop of rochester there are not the least remains of any considerable structure here or any thing to denote that a royal palace once existed on the spot  the ancient name of adgebrin through the assistance of mr bryants etymologies also leads me to determine this was a royal residence and had one of those high places consecrated to the worship of the sun ad being in use for a supreme title with which both deities and kings were honored among all the eastern nations ad was a peculiar title and was originally conferred upon the sun and if we may credit macrobius it signified one and was so interpreted by the assyrians in short ad and ada signified first  and in a more lax sense a prince or ruler   kings xi    genesis xxxvi      kings xx   nicolaus damase apud josephum antiq l   c     samuel viii   from thence and the evidence of bid it is clear the saxon kings resided at this place during some part of the heptarchy  a research into antiquity naturally produces this effect that we obtain testimonies of the derivation of our customs and an early visitation by eastern nations which latter circumstance has rather been treated by authors as a fabulous matter or so obscured by tradition that it was little credited  in mr bryants introductory preface he says it has been observed by many of the learned that some particular family betook themselves very early to different parts of the world in all which they introduced their rights and religion together with the customs of their country they represent them as very knowing and enterprizing and with good reason they were the first who ventured upon the seas and took long voyages they showed their superiority and address in the numberless expeditions which they made and the difficulties which they surmounted many have thought that they were colonies from egypt or from phoenicia having a regard only to the settlements which they made in the west but i shall show hereafter that colonies of the same people are to be found in the most extreme parts of the east where we may observe the same rites and ceremonies and the same traditional histories as are to be met with in their other settlements the country called phoenicia could not have sufficed for the effecting all that is attributed to these mighty adventurers it is necessary for me to acquaint the reader that the wonderful people to whom i allude were the the descendants of chus and called cuthites and cuseans they stood their ground at the general migration of families but were at last scattered over the face of the earth they were the first apostates from the truth yet great in worldly wisdom they introduced where ever they came many useful arts and were looked up to as a superior order of beings hence they were styled heroes demons heliadae macarians they were joined in their expeditions by other nations especially by the colateral branches of their family the mizraim caphtorim and the sons of canaan these were all of the line of ham who was held by his posterity in the highest veneration they called him amon and having in process of time raised him to a divinity they worshipped him as the sun and from this worship they were styled amonians this therefore will be the title by which i shall choose to distinguish the people of whom i treat when i speak of them collectively for under this denomination are included all of this family whether they were egyptians or syrians of phoenicia or of canaan to this i will add what a celebrated french author treating of the rise and progress of arts and sciences says touching the migrations of these easterns to attempt at least a colorable proposition touching the time britain received those visitants if not a conclusive one when we speak of the phoenicians we must distinguish the times with accuracy these people possessed originally a large extent of countries comprised under the name of the land of canaan they lost the greatest part of it by the conquests of the israelites under joshua the lands which fell in division to the tribe of asher extended to sidon that city notwithstanding was not subdued if the conquests of joshua took from the phaenicians a great part of their dominion they were well paid by the consequences of that event in effect the greatest part of the ancient inhabitants of palestine seeing themselves threatened with entire destruction had recourse to flight to save themselves sidon offered them an asylum by this eruption of the hebrew people the sidonians were enabled to send colonies where ever they thought proper sidon lent them ships and made good use of these new inhabitants to extend their trade and form settlements from hence that great number of colonies which went from phoenicia to spread themselves in all the countries of africa and europe we may date this event about the year of the world      and      years before christ spain was not the only country beyond the pillars of hercules which the phaenicians penetrated being familiarized with the navigation of the ocean they extended themselves to the left of the straits of cadiz as well as to the right strabo assures us that these people had gone over a part of the western coast of africa a little time after the war of troy we might perhaps determine their passage into england by a reflection which the reading of the writers of antiquity furnishes us with they are persuaded that all the tin that was consumed in the known world came from the isles of cassitorides and there is no doubt those isles were the sorlingues and a part of cornwall we see by the books of moses that in his time tin was known in palestine homer teaches us also that they made use of this metal in the heroic ages it should follow then that the phaenicians had traded in britain in very remote antiquity  after giving the reader these opinions of two authors highly distinguished in the literary world i must proceed to the application  near yevering is a place known by the name of yevering bell a lofty mountain one of the northwest cheviots of an oblong figure arising to a cone the name is supposed by the inhabitants of the country to be derived from the figure of the hill and consequently as applicable to any other of like form as this of which there are many among the cheviots we ascended the mountain from yevering by winding round its side to the south and east the only means of climbing to the top which was not attained without great labor from the steepness of the ascent the height of the bell being upwards  000 perpendicular feet taken from the plain at yevering the summit of the mountain is almost level encinctured with the remains of a wall placed on the brink of the steep which when entire was of considerable strength as appears from the materials the wall has been built without mortar of large flat stones with which the country abounds this wall forms and incloses an area of  000 paces in circumference the entrance is on the south side the breadth of the ruins of the wall on a medium is eight yards and by the stones on the surface it may be computed that there are about four fothers of stones to the yard it astonishes the spectator on viewing these remains when he computes that  000 fothers of stones at least were employed in this erection and those borne by human hands to a place totally inaccessable by carriages or cattle bearing burdens it may be alleged indeed that in a plot of ground  000 paces in circumference many stones might be won but the crown of the hill does in no wise encourage such a conjecture the ground wearing altogether a natural countenance no rocks or quarries appearing within the area to furnish such a vast quantity of stone and where the turf is broken a small gravel appears the eastern end of the area rises some few feet from the level of the plain taking our course by the wall before described at a point almost due east a broad way appeared three paces wide in a straight direction as if formed by an even pavement extending about  0 yards in ascent toward the crown of the hill we found this eminence surrounded by the remains of another wall but consisting of fewer materials in an exact circle   0 paces in circumference with a ditch within near the center of this inner area rather inclining to the east is a kairn of stones of no very great height arising about  0 paces in an easy ascent from the level of the inner wall the center of the kairn is hollow like a basin six paces from brim to brim after removing the turf and soil for a little depth we found the stones reduced to a sort of calx and every where retaining a strong impression of fire the view from this mountain is very extensive it affords a prospect of near  0 miles northward into scotland and over northumberland many miles to the southeast an opening of the mountains on that side and an extensive plain to the northward giving it that great command of prospect as a beacon hill it was fortunately placed as a place of heathenish worship it was conspicuous from many points of view where the sacrificial rites might be discovered and thereby the people called to worship on the northern side of the mountain are the remains of a forest or extensive grove of oaks a circumstance not to be found or at least not discovered by us on any of the hills within view from the summit of yevering bell on many parts of the sides of the hill are the remains of circular buildings but now so totally ruined and the stones so scattered that their former consequence or use are not to be discovered little more than the form of the foundations remaining several of them i took to be no other than folds for enclosing a number of sheep or cattle the ruins not containing materials sufficient for any large erection mr wallis a account of this remarkable place is loose and unsatisfactory about two hundred yards west from this column is a high hill called yevering bell from its belllike shape the top of an oblong figure a kairn on the east side with a circular trench many circular foundations of buildings upon the sides or slopes of both the whole encompassed with a wall of whinstone of a great breadth and length fallen down by age and tempests the work seemingly of the pagan danes for their priestoood and nobles to assemble on for legislation for devotion and sepulture the works on this mount appear to me of very remote antiquity and in attempting to explain their nature i will consider them singly and furnish the reader with all the lights i have collected as i presume they are so singular as to attract the attention of travelers who may hereafter traverse this country in search of antiquities in the first place we will consider this object in the manner it would naturally call for a strangers attention it cannot be conceived from the loftiness of the mountain the extreme difficulty of access the coldness of that high region and the inclemency of weather it is naturally subject to to have been used as a place of strength from these natural causes also it is not probable it should be used as a place for securing cattle and flocks against the incursions of an enemy it may reasonably from its very nature be admitted to be used for religious offices if used as a beacon only then whence the necessity of these circumvallations it has been conceived by some mr wallis in his antiquities of northumberland that it was possessed by the danes and that these works appertained to that people who here held their civil and religious conventions kairns placed on such immense eminences if marks of sepulture must denote the place of interment of remarkable personages and those too who did not die by the sword for the universal custom of the ancient inhabitants of this land who raised a tumulus over the dead appears to have been that of interring them where they were slain the circular buildings if appropriations to the administration of justice must have been adapted to several and separate ministers a thing scarcely probable if to the ministering of religious rites or to sepulture then indeed the inconsistency ceases the interior circumvallation appears calculated for the exclusion of the vulgar from the principal scene of religious rites where the priests and chief personages only ministered the wall which forms the grand enclosure of the whole crown of the mountain includes    acres and a half or very near it and would contain a prodigious number of people  in this wild and mountainous country the names and marks of antiquity have escaped those changes which naturally follow cultivation and it is in such parts we are to search for the evidences of the most remote antiquity existing in this kingdom it is certain the druids though they built temples and paid their adoration toward the sun always retained such distinction in their worship that they looked up to the great luminary as the throne or as the symbol and archetype only of the divinity which they confessed created and governed the universe and was the sole spirit of existence it will not follow that this purity was retained by all the inhabitants of the same land or the same mode of worship gained an universal acceptance among them many appointed for themselves places for private adoration and these eminences were most assuredly the chosen spots for devotees who paying their worship to the sun might loss the symbolical character and confounded with ignorance and superstition forget the archetype for the object the name of bell authorizes me to presume this place was sacred to the sun it being derived from the chaldean language and signifying the sun mr bryant says many worshipped upon hills and on the tops of high mountains imagining that they thereby obtained a nearer communication with heaven this practice in early times was almost universal and every mountain was esteemed holy the people who retired to eminences fancied that they were brought into the vicinity of the powers of the air and the deity who resided in the higher regions but the chief excellence for which they were frequented was the omphi the vox divina being esteemed a particular revelation from heaven in short they looked upon them as the peculiar places where god delivered his oracles the word omphi signifying the oracle of ham who according to the egygtian theology was the same as the sun or osiris he was likewise revered as the chief deity of the chaldeans and by most of the nations of the east  having thus shown the choice made by the ancients of high places for their adoration i will next consider the name of this place according to the etymologies laid down by mr bryant  bell bal or baal is a babylonish title appropriated to the sun and made use of by the amonians in other countries particularly in syria and canaan it signified  or lord and is often found compounded with other terms as belhamon and also belshamaim the great lord of the heavens this was a title given by the syrians to the sun by gib is meant an hill gibeon was the hill of the sun nadab the son of jereboam was slain at gibethon of the philistines   kings xv    so that belgebrin is no forced reduction of the present name of yevering bell or according to the more ancient name beladgebron and denominates the mount of the sun  as to the kairn which i mentioned to be situate on the eastern point of the area on the crown of the mount which is a conical pile terminating obtusely and basoned as before described i presume its name to be derived from keren which according to mr bryant signifies in its original sense a horn but it was a title of the sun himself for apollo was named carneus which was no other than cereneus the supreme deity the lord of light the priest of cybele in phrygia was styled carnas which was a title of the deity whom he served whence it is deducible that our kairn on the summit of this mount was the place of the altar where religious rites were performed in the fire worship and the like may be conceived of all those conical mounts called kairns they being a corruption of  kiron the place of the sun in forming these kairns as well the present one as others we visited in this neighborhood and one in particular on the crown of one of the highest mountains above newton called newton west tor the stones must have been carried up by a multitude of hands with immense labor suppose by the dimensions of one of these kairns which measured near  0 paces in circumference that there was contained therein  00 carriage loads of pebbles we will find the computation of labor and hands to be immense for the construction thereof when all the materials must be borne two miles of steep ascent to this amazing accumulation i was induced to believe i should discover some hearth stone or altar on the crown of some of the kairns but was disappointed perhaps time and the abhorrence which grew up with conversion against the rites of the heathen had removed the superstructure if any such there had been there was not one of the kairns i visited had the regular hollow basin but that on the bell which was exactly circular but composed of stones of a small size as far as i searched on my view i was immediately persuaded that all these accumulations called kairns situated on mountains and high places had not proceeded from a passion of honoring the dead but were formed by zealots who attending their worship carried with them progressively a burden to add to the grandeur loftiness and immensity of the sacred place where they paid their adoration the kairn on yevering is to the east an object regarded in the structures of the ancient britons in the remotest antiquity and by the easterns in erections of the like use these places have retained their ancient forms and their first names uncorrupted by reason of the mountainous nature of the country where cultivation cannot advance things of this sort must rest for ages unchanged it has been the case here besides the inhabitants are few and those subsisting on the extreme verge of poverty hourly employed in procuring a scanty subsistence add to this the depopulations which war for many ages occasioned would prevent those alterations which take place in times of peace mr bryant says the people of cappadocia and pontus observed the like method of worship and of all sacrifices whatever exhibited upon high places none perhaps ever equalled in magnificence that which was offered by mithridates upon his war with the romans he followed the persic modes of worship as well as the mixed rites of the chaldeans and syrians hence he chose one of the highest mountains in his dominions upon the top of which he reared an immense pile equal in size to the summit on which it stood and there he sacrificed to the god of armies the pile was raised by his vassal princes and the offerings besides those customary were wine honey oil and every species of aromatics the fire is said to have been perceived at the distance of near a thousand stadia so much must suffice on this point and in this place from innumerable instances produced by this learned author  my next enquiry will be touching the circumvallation which appears on yevering bell to show that this was a practice with the ancients on their consecrated hills mr bryant says the helladians and the persians were of the same family hence we find many similar rites subsisting among the two nations the latter adhered to the purer zabaism which they maintained a long time they erected the same sacred tupha or tumulus as the grecians and we may be assured of the original purpose for which these hills were raised from the use to which they put them they were dedicated to the great fountain of light called by the persians anait and were set apart as puratheia for the celebration of the rites of fire this people after they had defeated the sacae in cappadocia raised an immense comah in memorial of their victory strabo lib   p     who describes it very minutely tells us that they chose a convenient spot where they reared a petra or high place by heaping up a vast mound of earth this they fashioned to a conical figure and then surrounded it with a wall of stone in this manner they founded a temple in honor of anait i have mentioned that the egyptians had hills of this nature and from them the custom was transmitted to greece  the circular buildings mentioned to appear on the sides of the mount will be the last objects which require my attention before i draw my general conclusion i confess they did not appear to me so remarkable as to require taking any admeasurement but they are spoken of by mr wallis as being very singular and as i did not traverse all the sides of the mountain perhaps those of greater consequence escaped my observation but conceiving that they may be marks of antiquity among other matters i will trespass upon the reader with descriptions of those circular buildings in the northern parts of this island which have been visited by learned travelers and perhaps some future visitor of the cheviots may be induced to make a narrower search and more correct investigation but before i proceed thereto i will consider some others of mr bryants opinions which relate generally to my subject of yevering bell and particularly to the circular remains  mr bryant informs that these mounts were not only in greece but in egypt syria and most parts of the world they were generally formed by art being composed of earth raised very high which was sloped gradually and with great exactness and the top of all was crowned with a fair tower the situation of these buildings made them be looked upon as places of great safety and the reverence in which they were held added to the security on these accounts they were the repositories of much wealth and treasure in times of peril they were crowded with things of value in assyria was a temple named azara which the parthian plundered and is said to have carried off ten thousand talents to such as these solomon alludes when he makes his beloved say i am a wall and my breasts like towers though the word cumah or comah be generally rendered a wall yet i should think that in this place it signified the ground which the wall surrounded an enclosure sacred to cham the sun who was particularly worshipped in such places another passage in solomon we have a little sister and she has no breasts if she be a comah we will build upon her a palace of silver what is then termed a wall was a comah or high place which had been of old erected to the sun by the jebusites the ground set apart for such use was generally oval and toward one extremity of the long diameter as it were in the focus were these mounds and towers erected for there were many of these towers where they taught astronomy music and other sciences these places were likewise courts of judicature where justice was administered  in mr pennants voyage to the hebrides we have the following accounts of erections of this kind near inverness visit the celebrated edifices attributed to the danes the first is placed about two miles from the mouth of the valley of glen elg the more entire side appears of a most elegant taper form the present height is thirty feet six inches but in      some goth purloined from the top seven feet and a half under pretense of applying the materials to certain public buildings by the appearance of some ruins that now lie at the base and which have fallen off since that time i believe three feet more may be added to the height which will make the whole about fortyone feet  the whole is built with dry walls but the courses most beautifully disposed on one side is a breach of at least one quarter of the circumference the diameter within is thirtythree feet and a half taken at the distance of ten feet from the bottom the wall in that part is seven feet four inches thick but is formed thinner and thinner till it reaches the top whose breadth i forgot to cause to be measured the inside wall is quite perpendicular so that the inner diameter must have been equal from top to bottom but the exterior wall slopes increasing in thickness till it reaches the ground  in the thickness of the wall were two galleries one at the lower part about six feet two inches high and two feet five wide at the bottom narrowing to the top flagged and also covered over with great flat stones this gallery ran quite round and that horizontally but was divided into apartments in one place with six flags placed equidistant from each other and were accessible above by means of a hole from another gallery into the lower were two entrances before the ruin of the other side there had been two others above each of these entrances were a row of holes running up to the top divided by flags appearing like shelves near the top was a circle of projecting stones which probably were intended to hold the beams that formed the roof above is another hole like the former none of these openings pass through for there is not the least appearance of window or opening on the outside wall all these holes are square are too small to admit the human body so were probably designed to lodge arms and different other matters secure from wet or harm  over the first gallery was another divided from it only by flags this also went round but was free from any separation the height was five feet six only twenty inches wide at bottom this was also covered with flags at top  at a distance above in the broken sides of the wall was another hole but it seemed too small for a gallery the ascent was not safe so could not venture up the height was taken by a little boy who scrambled to the top  the entrance was a square hole on the west side before it were the remains of some building with a narrow opening that led to the door almost contiguous to this entrance or portico was a small circle formed of rude stones which was called the foundation of the druids houses it probably was formed for some religious purpose i was told there were many others of this kind scattered over the valley  at less than a quarter of a mile distant from this stands the second tower on a little flat on the side of the hill the form is similar but the number of galleries differs here are three the lowest goes entirely round but at the east end is an aperture now of small depth but once of such extent that the goats which sheltered in it were often lost on that account the entrance was filled with stones this is six feet high four feet two inches broad and flagged above and below  a second gallery was of the same height but the breadth of the floor only three feet five  the third gallery was of such difficult access that i did not attempt to get up it was so narrow and so low that it was with difficulty that the child who climbed to it could creep through  the present height of this tower is only twentyfour feet five inches the diameter thirty the thickness of the lower part of the wall twelve feet four  i could not perceive any traces of the winding stairs mentioned by mr gordon but these buildings have suffered greatly since that gentleman saw them i have no doubt of his accuracy  these were in all probability places of defense but it is difficult to say any thing on the subject of their origin or by what nation they were erected they are called here caisteal teilbali or the castle of teilba built by a mother for her four sons as tradition delivered in this translation of four erse lines informs my four sons a fair clan i left in the straith of one glen my malcomb my lovely conil my telve my troddan there had been two others now totally demolished and each named after her children mr gordon mentions others of this kind one of which is called the dune of dornadilla from an imaginary prince who reigned   0 years before the christian era  by a paragraph some time ago in lloyds evening post and from a note given by mr pennant which he says he had from the edinburgh magazine this place is described part of which i will transcribe as pertinent to my present object  the entrance is a very low and narrow door to pass through which one is obliged to stoop much but perhaps the ground may have been raised since the first erection when one is got in and placed in the center it is open over head all round the sides of the walls are ranged stone shelves one above another like the shelves in a circular beaufet reaching from near the bottom to the top there is some remains of an awkward staircase some years since i happened at an auction of books in london to look into a french book containing gaulish antiquities and there i saw a print of the remains of a druidic temple in france which greatly resembles the tower i am speaking of having like shelves in it and reading a late pamphlet on the antiquity of the irish language i think i can partly trace the origin of the name dornadilla  dorn means a round stone so that abdorn would mean the round stone of the priests na is of and di is god ulla means a place of devotion so that dornadiulla will signify the round stone place of the worship of god or perhaps it might allude to some round stone preserved within as a sacred emblem of divinity  from the whole of these quotations i would determine that by the name of yevering bell or beladgebrin is implied a sacred mount consecrated to the adoration of the sun and used in fire worship of this the kairn is a corroborating proof the circumvallation shows by its similarity to those spoken of that the persons who used this mount for their religious rites derived those rites from the same source as those quoted and fixes the antiquity of yevering bell to very remote ages it is a point not to be doubted that yevering for some time was the residence of the saxon kings in the heptarchy if we should carry the antiquity of yevering bell no further we will find its appropriation then to religious offices as probable as in a more distant antiquity the saxons brought with them many eastern customs they worshipped the sun had their high places and rites of fire worship and sacrifice as to my own judgment i should be inclined to fix the antiquity of this place to their era the druid tribes have left us such imperfect evidence of their customs that it is impossible to fix any thing positively there it is even most probable this was of saxon origin from its vicinity to the royal residence and the greatness of the work the circular buildings have never been fixed to any particular people their constructors still remain undiscovered the circles of ruins on the sides of yevering bell may have been similar to those visited by mr pennant it is probable these circular erections were the towers of the priests who there taught the principles of their religion and the elements of natural philosophy and that there they stored up the treasures of the country in times of public danger which from the veneration paid by all people to those sacred places were inviolable besides they were well calculated for defense upon assault the circles formed by rude and unhewn stones found in many parts of the north have been regarded by all antiquaries as places of public convocation where justice was dispensed the number of stones might denote the tribes or districts under the care of each druid as the israelites numbered their tribes by such columns at the passage of jordan  at a little distance from the bell to the southward is a large kairn of stones called tom tallons grave but who this personage was no history informs us  some mountains near yevering have the names of newton east and west tor on one of them is a kairn of stones also on the western point of cheviot and on a mount called whitlau all in view of each other these tors are said by several authors to be held by the saxons sacred to jupiter mr bryants remarks are tor is an hill or tower they were called by the amonians who first erected them tar and tor the same as the  of the chaldeans which signified both a hill and tower the words tar tor and tarit show that they implied temples and dedications to the sun  he instances many facts to prove this position among which are toron a place in macedonia literally signifying the tower of the sun also tirit of the same signification and torambi the oracular tower of ham  he has in another place this sentence i will therefore say so much in furtherance of the british antiquarian as to inform him that names of places especially of hills promontories and rivers are of long duration and suffer little change the same may be said of every thing which was esteemed at all sacred such as temples towers and high mounds of earth which in early times were used for altars  and in another place there was another name current among the amonians by which they called their  or high places this was taph which at times was rendered tuph toph and taphos the amonians when they settled in greece raised many tupha in different parts but as it was usual in ancient times to bury persons of distinction under heaps of earth formed in this fashion these tapha came to signify tombs and almost all the sacred mounds built for religious purposes were looked upon as monuments of deceased heroes of which he gives many instances  i have dwelt too long on this subject though an interesting one to those who may hereafter visit these places  i must not quit this country without remarking that as we advanced toward the boundary of the kingdoms the hills were clothed with a singular verdure affording fine sheep walks and the flocks and herds were numerous the cottages of the lower class of people are deplorable composed of upright timbers fixed in the ground the interstices wattled and plaistered with mud the roofs some thatched and others covered with turf one little piece of glass to admit the beams of day and a hearth stone on the ground for the peat and turf fire within there was exhibited a scene to touch the feelings of the heart description sickens on the subject and a tear of pity blots out the moving line which strives to depict i wished for some of the discontented great ones who palled with luxury despise their palaces to change the scene for a little just time sufficient to gain conviction that the cottager and crowned head are both of one specie of animals and of one race the damp earth the naked rafters the breezedisturbed embers and distracted smoke that issues from the hearth moved by contrary blasts breaking through a thousand crannies the midday gloom the wretched couch the wooden utensils that scarce retain the name of convenience the domestic beast that stalls with its master the disconsolate poultry that mourn on the rafters form a group of objects for a great mans contemplation  the inhabitants are of abject countenance and miserably clothed seeming to confess the lowest degree of poverty the employment of the men is in the field most of them are shepherds or herdsmen the corn land which is very little in quantity compared with the meadows and grazing grounds lays mingled with the other over the open faces of the vales without any fences to protect which many an indolent herdsman stands for hours wrapped up in his played hanging over a staff half animated or otherwise laying prostrate upon the ground during the time he is engaged in this duty if he had a spade put in his hand and was broke into the rules of industry he might be most usefully employed he could fence the ground which he tends in the time he spends in herding it but evil customs when they correspond with habitual indolence are as hard to be eradicated as to move a mountain  a long series of applications and labor and the redoubled effects of example and experience must effect it in consequence of this stupid custom the farmer is necessarily obliged to keep a multitude of servants their wages are paid in the products of the land  grain wool maintenance of sheep and cattle very few money payments being used  from the openness of the country the traveller is consequently perplexed with cross roads where not a guidepost has been known since the creation to remedy this evil intelligence must be gained from one of these herds and it is remarkable that there is a ferocity and uncultivated fullenness of mind in those twolegged animals which scarce confesses civilization enough to direct a stranger on his way when you obtain instructions it is in a manner as he would chase a beast from trespass i cannot forbear comparing the countenance of the lower class of english in the northern counties with that of the scotch  i do not draw my remarks solely from my present tour but through observations made in many little pleasure jaunts in scotland  though you perceive the most abject poverty in the lowest rank of the scotch people yet even under those weeds of distress there is seen a singular openness and benevolence of countenance by some it may be objected that this arises from their servility and these are no other than feigned looks of submission arise from what it will such countenance carries more of the character of humanity than the proud sternness and brutal insolence which mark those who boast a savage liberty but it is to be observed that servility stamps the countenance with abject timidity which is not written on the scotch features  a generous nature and the liberality of a mind enlarged with education are rather the givers of such openness and benevolence of look almost every scotch village is blessed with a free school you will find shepherds on the scotch hills familiar with the poets and historians of rome and greece such familiarity introduces an adoption of principles and sentiments and from thence we see in these poor people the maxims of mind which graced the illustrious names of old can we wonder then at the desparity there appears in the lower class of the two nations  but there is another source from whence a part of this complaisancy and hospitality of the lower scotch may be deduced they are strict in their religious principles they are punctual attendants on public worship they hold with great sacredness their observance of the sabbath day most of their pastors are not only rigid in their example but arduous in their duty and administration amongst the people there is a just sense conceived even in the lowest minds of mans duty to his god the reverse is so conspicuous in the english that the comparison is scarce required so far from perceiving a religious principle in the lower classes some of them have not even been informed of their redeemer thousands have never entered a place of worship the sabbath is distinguished only as a day of idleness in which gaming and drinking are pursued many of the teachers of the gospel with an indolence and aversion apparent in their whole carriage perform as a stale and stupid task the offices of the church men are influenced by example evil example contaminates the most where the minds are most illiterate weak men take many of their vices by adoption if it were not for our new sectaries our rambling preachers the name of god would not be promulged to onetenth part of englands inhabitants it is true they teach his laws as the laws of the god of terrors it is better they should administer to him with the horrors of hell than there be no ministry we have reformed the church till we have expelled the spirit of prayer we have refined the pulpit till nothing but the grace of declamation remains and our church manners are polished into that exquisite insipidity that if it were not for tithes the major part of the parish would forget the holy men of god  kirk newton lay next in our way a small village one of the manors of the barony of wark the ancient residence of the strothers sir henry strother king edward ii william strother king edward vi mark strother high sheriff   king george i wallis now the property of john strother ker esquire  opposite to kirk newton is  the castle of copeland now the possession of the rev dr newton ogle it was the ancient residence of the wallaces edward wallace king edward ii william queen elizabeth george    king james i wallis and was possessed by edward wallace in the reign of king edward ii in whose family it continued till of late years  within a little distance of copeland three remarkable battles were fought the one on the plains of milfield where a body of the scotch were defeated before the battle of branxton by sir william bulmer of brancepeth who commanded the forces of the bishopric of durham the scots lay in ambush among the broom which then covered the plain  milfield now a little village was the residence of the saxon kings of bernicia after the death of edwin  another battle was fought at a place called haltwell sweire where sir henry percy brother to the sixth earl of northumberland was defeated in the fifth year of the reign of queen mary      by a troop of the scots under the command of the earl of bothwell consisting of  000 horse percys cavalry were thrown into confusion by a discharge of fire arms to which they were not well trained  the third battle was at broomridge the place of this battle is treated with great uncertainty by many authors the name used by fordun is brunauburgh camden from its similarity fixes it at broomrigs the many lines breastworks and intrenchments testify that this was the place of some great action where a confusion of lines and intrenchments are yet to be seen here athelstan engaged the united forces of constantine king of scotland eugenius oweine or ewaine king of cumberland and anlap the dane in the year     and gained a complete victory though with the loss of elwin and athalstan his kinsmen men of great valor constantine escaped into scotland anlaf took refuge in dublin but what became of ewaine is not mentioned it is presumed this ewaine is interred in penrith churchyard his sepulcher denoted by a very singular monument there this victory was greatly celebrated by henry of huntington william of malmsbury and ingulph  mailross being the seminary from whence sprang the first bishop of the sea of lindisfarn which constitutes so material a part of the church antiquities of this county and as the great patron saint the holy st cuthbert was educated there and from thence brought to lindisfarn it seemed of consequence that i should view the seat from whence issued so much to exercise my attention in the remaining part of the tour i had thus far prosecuted i determined to visit mailross and passed the village of paston formerly belonging to the family of selbys on an adjoining hill called the harelaw the name implying the station of an army is a circular intrenchment with a double rampire and fosse from thence there is a fine prospect of the vale where it gave us great pleasure to observe the new modes of husbandry taking place  turnips cultivated in drill sowing with horse and hand hoeing practiced there is a very great want of fences in this part of the country habit and custom are only to be subdued by time and example  after passing some few miles beyond the boundary of the kingdoms and gaining an eminence above tweeddale we had a view of kelso and the rich extensive vale which borders the river having traveled near    miles in the rude and mountainous country from wooler where we seldom had in sight a cultivated valley or fertile tract of any consequence except at paston or the plain of milfield but all the mighty scene was filled with stupendous mountains on whose summits rested an incessant gloom and driving rain and after climbing those lofty steeps in search of evidences of antiquity and traversing boundless wastes the present prospect gave us unusual pleasure the vale before us abounded in corn and the extended scene possessed all the variety that nature exhibits the distant grounds were lifted up in a wild arrangement of mountains by the margin of the river the yellow fields were so mixed with the meads as to resemble flowers of gold wrought on the green robe of happy tweed few fences subdivide the vale but here and there fine woods are scattered before us lay the delightful town of kelso on the left hand a cultivated country through which the tweed flows in meanders on whose banks sir john douglass and the palace of the duke of roxburgh with their extensive woodlands are beautifully disposed the helton mountains three fine conic eminences form obelisks at the distance of    miles up the vale over which and on each side mountains behind mountains are seen not united but distinctly surging from little valleys which open around their bases then glowing with streams of yellow light this hue was delicately mellowed by the azure tinge of the hills which formed the horizon the same mountainous ground was in the distant prospect in front only differing in this that the eye penetrated the cultivated vales at the feet of the hills which stand at a much greater distance from each other and did not appear thrown together as in the longer line of perspective to the right we viewed the seat of dr johnston embowered in thick woods down the river the vale is more contracted and less distant prospect was taken in the town of coldstream was distinctly viewed with a multitude of inferior villages above which the seat of lord hume with the rising plantations around kelsoe abbey it fill the inclining ground i never beheld a richer valley than we looked upon here the crops of corn were surprizingly great the whole being reaped stood in sheafs the meadows were luxuriant and every object wore the happy aspect of opulence  we constantly regretted the want of fences in this tour they would give a great grace to the banks of tweed by intersecting the rich scene the advantage they would be of to the country is obvious they would check the severities of winter and resist that raking blast which when unopposed shears the extensive grounds wherever it passes in the spring of the year consequently they would forward the progress of summer  we descended to the town of  kelso which lays on the northern banks of tweed and to which we had access by a fine stone bridge of six arches  from the southern banks of the river the town with its invirons has the most picturesque appearance where i stood to observe its beauties i had the bridge on my right an excellent though plain structure of modern work stretching across a fine river of transparent water gently curling over a pebbly channel on the opposite shore which is banked in stands the modern and elegant mansion of mrs dixon a widow lady a square hewnstone structure placed in the midst of a garden opening to the river ornamented with a small gothic temple a greenhouse and stove with statues disposed on the grass plots which were intersected with gravel walks and flower knots over this modern and fashionable scene an august pile in all the solemnity of ruin frowns majestically  an old abbey stands near this mansion a lofty structure built in the heaviest of the gothic order  two round towers of the south limb of the cross surmounted by a part of the center tower formed the aspect on which we looked the windows are small and the whole edifice gloomy  it is strange what dissimilar ideas sometimes strike the imagination as i gazed upon this scene i said to myself thus charactacus in the great reverse of his fortune looked with contempt on the pageantry and pomp of his roman conquerors there could not be a finer contrast than in these two structures the town of kelso crowded the back ground of our prospect to the left the view opened upon the vale terminated by the noble woods which adjoin the seat of the duke of roxburgh to the right through the arches of the bridge were seen fine perpendicular rocks crowned with stately trees on the rivers brink  we entered kelso which is clean and well built mr pennant says it is much after the manner of a flemish town it has a spacious square marketplace with a townhouse piazzad beneath for the convenience of the market the number of inhabitants about  000 the weekly market considerable vast quantities of corn being sold here though chiefly by sample the inn was elegant the people obliging and the attendants particularly alert and condescending  kelso is a borough of the duke of roxburgh and is governed by his bailiff it is not remarkable for any great manufactory or trade but appears to be the place of residence of many people of easy fortune some part of the great stocks of wool furnished by this country is manufactured here into cloths called plains but dressed in england there is also a manufacture of white leather for the edinburgh market  the monastery here was founded by king david during his brother alexanders reign he had brought over from tyrone in france certain monks of a reformed order founded by bernard dabbeville a man of high reputation for sanctity and severity of life these he settled first at selkirk with an ample revenue afterward making roxburgh his residence he removed his favorite monks thither and when he came to the crown built for them the abbey and monastery of kelso and fixed them there on the  d of may      having dedicated the church to the virgin mary and st john the evangelist bernard the founder of this order was a disciple of robert darbrisser founder of the order of fontevraud which by a constitution almost peculiar to itself consisted of both monks and nuns and had an abbess to govern the society bernard founded the monastery of tyrone in the year   0  from which place his disciples derived their name the habit of the tyronensian monks was a light gray but was afterward changed to black fordun positively says these monks settled at selkirk in   0  but symeon of durham that they were not placed there till      and remained fifteen years according to fordun the succession of abbots was as follows ralph one of the monks brought over from france was the first abbot but on the death of bernard returned to succeed him in the abbacy of tyrone william succeeded to selkirk and on the death of ralph also returned to tyrone as successor to that abbacy herbert succeeded william and was the first abbot of kelso it is presumed that david who was a lover of the fine arts as well as a patron of every national improvement had in view on his importing this colony from france not only the advancement of religion but also that of arts and sciences of which his subjects were in great need of cultivation their only occupations from the remotest ages having been the duty of shepherds and the service of the sword in the history of the monastic orders we find that bernard the founder of the tyronensians would have all sorts of handicrafts practiced in his monastery as well to prevent the growth of idleness which he esteemed the mother of vice as to procure necessaries for the support of life accordingly in this body were painters carvers joiners smiths masons vinedressers and husbandmen who were under the command of an elder and what they earned was put into a common stock for the maintenance of the house kelso afterward sent forth colonies to the foundations of lismahago kilwinning aberbrothick and lindores  this abbey was demolished in      leslie lib  0 p     monasteria dunfernlingense melrosense kelsorum miseris modis sectarii vestabant in consequence of that enthusiastic reformation which in its violence was a greater disgrace to religion than all the errors it was intended to subvert reformation has hitherto always appeared in the form of a zealot full of fanatic fury with violence subduing but through madness creating almost as many mischiefs in its oversights as it overthrew errors in its pursuit religion has received a greater shock by the present struggle to repress some formularies and save some scruples than it ever did by the growth of superstition she now bleeds inwardly thinking men are driven into confusion and the unthinking turn infidels  these are the glorious works of modern fanaticism  the abbey of kelso was built in the form of a greek cross the nave and quire are totally demolished the north and south ailes remain standing being each about  0 paces in length the walls are ornamented with false round arches intersecting each other the remains of the eastern end show a part of a fine open gallery two sides of the center tower are standing now near  0 feet high but have been much more lofty it is galleried within the pillars are clustered the arches circular with few members and without any great ornament the north and south ends have an uniformity bearing each two round towers the centers rising sharp to the roof the north door way is formed by a circular arch with various members falling behind each other supported on pilasters the windows and work above very plain three bells now hang in the uppermost windows this part of the nave having lately been used for divine service we did but just look into it all pomp was utterly eradicated and every degree of pageantry defaced the windows of this abbey are of circular arches and remarkably small the whole mode of architecture singular and unlike any structure i remember to have seen in england the walls are thick and every where ponderous there is a gothic gloominess throughout the whole that carries the appearance of a prison rather than a house of prayer and yet these ruins have a countenance of sullen solemnity which mingling with the beautiful scene around has a grand effect  the revenues of this religious house amounted to  000l per annum scots and arose in money payments the abbot was allowed to wear a mitre and pontifical robes to be exempt from episcopal jurisdiction and permitted to be present in all general councils it was at first under the bishopric of st andrews but afterward made a member of the sea of glasgow it had several immunities and the abbot and monks had liberty to receive ordination and the other sacraments of the church from any bishop they pleased in scotia or cumbria by inness critical essay this cambia is construed to be the sea of glasgow for reasons too tedious to insert here king malcolm in      granted a confirmatory charter to this abbey the witnesses to which are remarkable  the three bishops of glascow murray and dunkeld william and david the kings brothers and ada his

 the inhabitants of kelso have made a good change in their place of worship a new church being built in great simplicity of architecture of an octagonal form    feet in diameter ornamented with a glazed cupola or lanthorn in the center supported by a circle of pillars the whole commodious cleanly and decent  the lands adjoining upon kelso are very fine the prospects delightful from the chalkheugh you look upon the confluence of the rivers tiviot and tweed commanding a view of the borders of each river for a considerable distance above the landscape is filled by the remains of the castle of roxburgh the elegant seat of sir john douglas with fleurus on the offscape these objects mingle with much wood and fine meads from an eminence called pinnacle hill you command a long course of the tweed whose silver stream glides through a highly cultivated country turnips and cabbages for the use of cattle cover many large tracts and pototoes appear in vast fields much wheat is raised in the neighborhood part of which is sent up the firth of forth and part into england  pennants tour in scotland part ii the sheep are of an improved breed and bear good fleeces carrying a price of  0s per stone   lb the aberdeen manufacture of stockings or that of linlithgow takes the finest the rest is chiefly sold into yorkshire except what supplies the small manufactory of kelso  i am partial to the sentiments of the celebrated traveller mr pennant my adopting them is a confession of vanity as it acknowledges a coincidence of mind the reader will find them here i doubt not of a price sufficient to purchase my pardon  i cannot leave kelso without regretting my not arriving there in time to see the races which had been the preceding week these are founded not on the sordid principles of gaming or dissipation or fraud but on the beautiful basis of benevolence and with the amiable view of conciliating the affections of two nations where the good and the bad common to every place are only divided by a rill scarcely to be distinguished but prejudice for a time could find no merit but within its own narrow bourn some enlarged minds however determined to break the fascination of erroneous opinion to mix with their fellow subjects and to instruct both the great vulgar and the small that the northern and southern bounders of the tweed created in their inhabitants but a mere difference without a distinction and that virtue and good sense were equally common to both at these races the stewards are selected from each nation a percy and a douglas may now be seen hand in hand the example of charity spreads and may it spread with all its sweet influences to the remotest corner of our island  what pleasing times to those that may be brought in contrast when every house was made defensible and each owner garrisoned against his neighbor when revenge at one time dictated an inroad and necessity at another when the mistress of a castle has presented her sons with their spurs to remind them that their larder was empty and that by a forray they must supply it at the expense of the borderers when every evening the sheep were taken from the hills and the cattle from their pasture to be secured in the lower floor from robbers prowling like wolves of prey and the disappointed thief found all in safety from the fears of the cautious owner the following simple lines give a true picture of the times then johnie armstrong to willie began say billie a riding then will we england and us have been long at feud perhaps we may hit on some booty then they are come on to huttonha they rade that proper place about but the lord he was the wiser man for he had left nae geir without these were the exploits of petty robbers but when princes dictated an inroad the consequences bore a proportion to their rank an armstrong might drive away a few sheep but when an henry directs an invasion     towns towers steads barnekyns churches and bastelhouses are burnt  0  scots slain     taken prisoners  0    cattle       sheep      nags and geldings  00 goats  00 bolls of corn and insight gear without measure carried off such were the successes during four months of the year       in kelso abbey many illustrious persons were interred among the first of whom was the son of king david the founder  here henry iii of england with his queen met with alexander iii of scotland and his queen when great cordiality and friendship was experienced between the nobles of both realms who attended their sovereigns  in the reign of king henry iv of england and king robert iii of scotland a d   0  a truce was concluded here which was of considerable duration by the commissioners of both realms  in    0 king james iii of scotland was crowned at kelso when the nobles paid their homage and swore fealty to the new sovereign  in      the english in a sudden incursion pillaged and burnt kelso but were soon repelled by the forces of mers and tiviotdale this spoil is attributed to lord dacres and some authors say he burnt  0 villages in that expedition and overthrew    stone built towers with all their bulwarks  in the reign of king henry viii a d      the duke of norfolk advancing to the scotch borders burnt and levelled with the ground    places of considerable note in scotland among which was kelso with its abbey  in      sir ralph eure carried fire and sword to the banks of tweed and destroyed the tenements in kelso which had been reedified since the former devastation  the detail of mutual cruelties and savage spoil is horrible  they were a disgrace to human nature  there was a convent of red friars at the mouth of tiviot near kelso but who was its founder or what was its revenue is not known spotswoods history of the church of scotland   as i have had occasion to speak of the scotch church and as church tyranny south of the tweed is exclaimed against with violence and indignation it may not be disagreeable to the reader to see how our neighbors the scotch are in that matter amidst all their boasted puritanism in my notes i shall give a short state of facts which came to a solemn hearing before the presbytery this present year the case arose between a dr john wotherspoon and some gentlemen of the town of paisley these gentlemen had passed a few hours together in a private room over a social glass it happened that this was the day preceding the celebration of the sacrament which gave a handle to the doctor to take offense he accordingly called them before his kirk session but in place of libelling them for drunkenness he accused them of some scandalous indecencies approaching even to prophanity and while this action was pendent and before any proof was heard and even before some of the gentlemen accused had appeared before the session he thought proper to mount his pulpit and issue forth in the shape of a sermon a most dreadful flination in which he adjured his bearers by the most solemn ties to have no communication or fellowship with such pointed them out as objects of popular resentment and concluded with the apostles advice to his followers have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness but rather reprove them he next proceeded to make proofs before the sessions which did not at all appear to support the accusation however a majority of the session concurred in a sentence ordering the gentlemen to appear before the face of the congregation to receive his public rebuke and referred to the presbytery what public censure should be inflicted the gentlemen did not choose o submit to this public discipline especially from their violent persecutor but appealed to the presbytery who after full hearing and great deliberation unanimously reversed the sentence ordering the gentlemen to be dismissed with a rebuke from the bar on which they declared their sorrow for having met on that particular day if it gave offense dr wotherspoon ill brooking the moderation of the presbytery instantly threatened if the presbytery did not affirm the sentence of his session and also inflict a more severe censure to print his sermon prefix the gentlemens names to it and either bring them to the submission he wished or brand their names with infamy and disgrace through the british dominions and immediately after the presbyterys sentence he did publish his sermon with a narrative prefixed accusing the gentlemen by name of all the crimes he had laid to their charge but of which the presbytery had unanimously acquitted them and it was advertised to be sold in every corner of scotland where any of the gentlemen had any connections paisley glasgow edinburgh sterling etc the doctor also entered an appeal to the general assembly which he afterward thought proper to withdraw the gentlemen brought their action before the court of session complaining very loud of the injuries they had suffered and which they said had been attended with very bad consequences to them the court expressed the highest indignation against dr wotherspoons conduct gave   0l damages with costs to a considerable amount behold a scotch cardinal woolsey  are such ministers a benefit to true religion the religion of the mind that dwells with peace   we now pursued our journey crossed the river tiviot at the mill ford and traveled up the southern banks of tweed to mailross the three helton mountains being our point of direction mailross laying behind them and they a landmark constantly in view  we passed sir john douglass on our left an elegant little mansion of hewn stone the walks and pleasure grounds around it neat to a degree of exactness the lands rich and the woods disposed at a proper distance on the opposite side of tweed the palace of the duke of roxburgh presented its extensive front flanked with immense woods for three miles the banks of the river as we passed were clothed with a fine forest in some places the road leading along the summit of lofty cliffs from whence we looked down upon the river and opposite rocks whose brows were crowned with noble trees  we arrived at  roxburgh castle at present consisting of little more than a lofty eminence of an oblong figure elevated above the plain about  0 perpendicular feet chiefly natural on the brink of which are the remains of a wall the outward defense of the ancient castle the interior part is now planted with trees this mount is defended at the foot on the north and west sides by a deep moat and outward rampire of earth a fine plain intervening between these outworks of the castle and the river the dimensions within the walls where the interior fortress stood we could not obtain for the trees and thickets the western point is guarded by an outwork and mound of earth which is severed from the chief part of the castle by a moat but included in the outward works the fosse and rampire before described the fosse or moat was supplied with water by a dam which crossed the river tiviot in an oblique direction the remains of which still appear the south and east sides are defended by an inaccessible precipice at whose foot the river runs with a rapid current  camden says this castle was anciently called marchidun from its standing on the marches and for natural situation and towered fortifications was in times past exceeding strong the fortress having been surprised by the english james ii of scotland whilst he laid siege to it with a vast army to recover it was slain by the bursting of a large piece of ordnance as for the castle it was surrendered and then raised it is now in a manner quite vanished and its ancient grandeur totally defaced  mr pennant says the first mention i find of it is in      when a treaty was concluded here on the part of king stephen by thurstan archbishop of york between him and king david i  but in symeon dunelm we are informed that john cardinal of crima legate pervenit apud flavium tudam qui northumbriam and loidam determinat in loco qui rocheburch vocatur it is told to the eternal disgrace of this legate that in a council at london having declaimed bitterly against the sin of a priest who had risen from the side of an harlot to consecrate the host he was found himself the following night in bed with an harlot of pope honorius came to the scottish king at roxburgh in the year      to determine the controversy touching the primacy of york over the scottish church in      king david returning from the court of england was attended to roxburgh by thurstan archbishop of york ralph bishop of durham and algar prior of st cuthberts convent in durham smiths appendage to bid p       king david i made this the place of his residence during the reign of his brother alexander hither he brought his favorite monks of tyrone from selkirk before he placed them at kelso and built the abbey there he added to the strength of the place increased its fortifications and made it one of the chief bulwarks of his kingdom  malcolm macbeth who pretended to be the son of earl angus and was in arms against his sovereign king david in      was imprisoned in the tower of roxburgh  by the chronicle of mailross it appears that the church of st james at roxburgh was dedicated the   th of april       king david was the great patron of every national improvement he observed the example of lewis le gros in civil and commercial establishments and granted many charters of incorporation to his cities and burghs the burgh laws he caused to be framed from the remarks made by learned men sent by him for the purpose into foreign states to reap the spirit and efficacy of each constitution it is probable that roxburgh was one of the first of those communities in scotland for in an ancient manuscript copy of the burgh laws of which david was the undoubted author the title prefixed declares them to be the laws and customs of the four burghs viz berwick roxburgh edinburgh and sterling a further evidence that these were the first royal burghs is in the court kept by the kings chamberlain where his office appears to give him jurisdiction over all the kings burghs the court being called the court of the four burghs and consisted of delegates from the burghs above mentioned three or four from each burgh who by virtue of the chamberlains summons assembled annually at haddington where all appeals from the peculiar courts of each single burgh were heard and finally determined  the confirmatory charter of king malcolm to kelso dated      was given at roxburgh it appears by this charter that the king made roxburgh his residence as he frequently attended divine service at the church at kelso for he confirms to that church all the offerings made by himself and his attendants whenever on solemnities or other days he heard the service of god in that church the populousness of roxburgh and the country in the neighborhood may be inferred from the mention of churches in that place granted to the kelso convent as freely as they had been held by acceline the archdeacon and which churches seem distinct from the then lately erected church of st james the same appears from the grant of  0 chalders partly corn and partly meal inter farinam and frumentum to be paid out of the roxburgh mills which probably was the estimate of the amount of the seventh part of the mills granted in davids charter to the abbey of selkirk mention is also made of a new town of roxburgh  in      the rebellious harold earl of caithness was confined in roxburgh this perfidious earl having delivered torphin his son as an hostage for his future fidelity by his repeated treasons occasioned him to become a sacrifice to the resentment of his king who in his wrath being devoid of humanity gave the innocent youth up to the most dreadful tortures and excruciating death his eyes were bored out and his genitals torn off   in   0  william the lion assembled a great army at roxburgh to oppose king john who had approached the borders and lay at norham but hostilities were prevented by a timely convention and a truce  in      king john incensed against the northern barons for their doing homage to king alexander ii at felton marched northward in the middle of winter and laid the country waste with fire and sword exercising the greatest cruelties on the distracted inhabitants he burnt the towns of milford morpeth alnwick wark and roxburgh in this horrid expedition  in      roxburgh appears to have been restored for here king alexander ii celebrated his marriage on the  th of march in that year with the daughter of ingelram de conci and on the  th of september      the queen brought forth a son here alexander who succeeded to the crown of scotland  in      roxburgh was the place of refuge for king alexander iii and his young queen who had been prohibited consummation of their marriage by the guardians of the kingdom of which complaint had been sent to king henry iii her father wherein she set forth the hardships she underwent from the guardians who held her in strict confinement refused her the attendants and maids she chose and debarred her from the embraces of her husband the earl of gloucester with others sent by king henry assisted by the earl of dunbar and his adherents surprised the castle of edinburgh and taking possession of the persons of the king and queen conveyed them under a strong guard to roxburgh where the queens distresses were relieved although her royal spouse was then only    years of age  prince edward son to henry iii when on an expedition against the northern rebels who were in combination with john de vescy after his forfeiture of alnwick proceeded to roxburgh in the year      where he was received with the greatest demonstrations of joy by the king and queen of scotland attended on that occasion by a numerous body of the scotch nobility  the marriage of alexander prince of scotland to the daughter of the earl of flanders was celebrated here on the  th of april      the nuptial feast being continued for    days with the greatest magnificence  king edward i in      reduced the castle of roxburgh where he continued several days with his army during which time he was reinforced with   000 fresh troops from wales  in the succeeding year edward having mustered his forces at newcastle with an army of  000 heavy armed horse   00 light horse and  00000 foot proceeded to the scotch border the scotch army which for a considerable time had laid before roxburgh in hopes of restoring to his liberty the bishop of glasgow who was prisoner there hearing of so great an army advancing raised the siege the relief brought by the english to the garrison of roxburgh castle was highly seasonable for they were already reduced to great hardships and the inhabitants of the town from the circumvallation formed by the scotch were brought to great distress for want of provisions  on shrove tuesday in the year      the garrison of roxburgh indulging themselves on that festival in an impolitick security were given up to riot and dissipation when they were surprised by sir james douglas with a resolute band who having approached in disguise mounted the walls by ladders of ropes the name of douglas echoed through the place and roused the english from their festivity and drunkenness many of them falling under the sword of the assailants the governor retired into the great tower with a few of his men where after two days resistance having received a wound in his face by an arrow he surrendered the fortress king robert bruce on receiving intelligence of this exploit sent his brother edward to demolish the fortifications which he effected with great labor  king edward iii in      having come to newcastle in quality of supreme of scotland received the homage of edward baliol in a public and solemn manner at which time baliol as a recompense for the expenses king edward had sustained in recovering and restoring to him his inheritance by letters patent alienated to him amongst other things the town castle and county of roxburgh to be annexed to and incorporated with the crown of england for ever  in      we find roxburgh again in the possession of the scotch havbeen recovered by sir alexander ramsay for king david bruce  king edward iii in      received from baliol a formal surrender of his right to the crown of scotland this he performed by the ceremony of delivering his crown with some of the soil of scotland at roxburgh where edward resided some days this king twice celebrated his birthday in this castle  in      george dunbar earl of march accompanied by his brother the earl of murray with a large body of their dependants entered roxburgh at the time of the annual fair and in revenge of the death of one of their followers who was slain the preceding year in an affray slew all the english they found in the town plundered it of the great quantities of merchandise and goods which were collected there on the above occasion and reduced the town to ashes  king james ii of scotland availing himself of a neglect in the english of attending a proposed convention for continuing the truce in    0 raised an army with great expedition with which he advanced against roxburgh at the first assault he took the town and levelled it to the ground a regular siege was laid to the castle here the scotch king was joined by great reinforcements among which was the earl of huntley with his followers the king for former services desirous of honoring huntley showed him every mark of esteem and royal favor he conducted him to the trenches to observe the discharge of his artillery one of which was remarkable for its size and had the name of the lion the king took delight in attending these operations in which he showed a distinguished intrepidity but in the end lost his life thereby one of his pieces of ordnance in this siege to which he had approached too near burst in discharging whereby the earl of angus who stood near the king was much wounded at the instant that a splinter broke the kings thigh and struck him dead this is the tragical circumstance before quoted from camden the queen with her eldest son then a boy about seven years of age is said to have been in the camp at the time of this dreadful catastrophe she sustained the shock with heroic firmness exhorted the chiefs to desist from unavailing lamentations and to testify their reverence for their kings memory by carrying on the siege with redoubled vigor her exhortations had the desired effect the besiegers exerted their utmost efforts the garrison finding themselves reduced to extremities surrendered the fortress and as redpath in his border history says that the place which the english had held for more than  00 years might thenceforth cease to be a center of rapine and violence or a cause of future strife between the nations the victors reduced it to a heap of ruins  we do not find that the fortress was restored or that any repairs were made to it to render it tenable until      when the english army led by the protector passing the tweed after the battle of musselbrough encamped on the plain over against kelso between the ruins of the ancient castle of roxburgh and the confluence of tweed and tiviot the protector observing the strong and convenient situation of this ruined fortress determined to make it tenable the breaches in part of the ancient walls were filled with bankings of turf he having reduced the fortress in size by casting up deep trenches on the east and west ends within and fortified them with a wall pattens account of these repairs is in the following terms that one great ditch of  0 feet broad with depth accordingly and a wall of like breadth depth and height should be made cross within the castle from the one side wall to the other and  0 foot from the west end and that a like trench and wall should also be cast atraverse within about a coits cast from the east end and hereto that the castle walls on either side where need was should be mended with turf and made with loopholes as well for shooting directly forwards as for flanking at hand so intent was the protector on this work that he labored at it with his own hands two hours every day whilst it was going on and his example was followed by most of the principal men of his army the place was made defensible in six days and there was left in it a garrison of  00 soldiers and  00 pioneers under sir ralph bulmer  mr pennant says a large holly surrounded by a wall marks the spot where james ii fell but it was not noted to me when i visited the place  near to the site of roxburgh are the confused foundations of buildings and one gateway of excellent workmanship which denote the place where stood a house of franciscans  it is not possible to tread this ground without the most serious reflections the vicissitudes of human life here so remarkably experienced furnish the traveller with a crowd of ideas producing melancholy determinations here where this turf now painted with flowers is browsed by the flocks once stood a town flourishing in trade where festivity and mirth often engaged the wealthy inhabitants where the royal presence was encircled with the nobility of the land where the splendor of a court was displayed where the royal nuptials and the birth of princes made a kingdom joyful where peace brought her olives to crown felicity  and in reverse of circumstances where these cattle graze armed troops have held their deadly conflicts the soil has drank in the blood of heroes and nobles even royalty has bled upon these plains the shoots of victory or the cries of distress have often distracted these now peaceful echoes which make responses to the bleating sheep cannon have rent the confused atmosphere and the clangour of marshal instruments has filled the gale which now breathes music in the murmuring groves revenge rapine and innumerable crimes have cursed the ground i tread with every human sin avenging providence at length has razed the walls conscious of such iniquity the haughty towers are levelled with the earth the ploughshare has gone over the paths of wicked ages and all but the name of roxburgh is clean done out  as roxburgh fell so have empires fallen and though it is a reflection which brings with it the acutest sorrow yet it must be admitted that when the accomplishment of time is come other empires must sink into oblivion power and magnificence are periodical we know not which will be the next that yields in the succession heaven grant that britain by her virtues may merit the divine protection and that her empire may survive to the latest ages full of honor  it is very remarkable that not the least traces remain to mark the place where so large a town once stood a place so eminent and of so great resort for trade the residence of kings and the seat of such conventions  the adjoining territory from the old castle and town is called the sheriffdom of roxburgh of which the douglass are hereditary sheriffs and usually denominated sheriffs of tiviotdale  our road on the banks of tweed led through a cultivated country but ill fenced and the modes of husbandry gradually growing worse as we proceeded we passed the house of colonel mac dougle situate on the north banks of tweed a handsome mansion on the brink of a steep descent in the front a terrace and grass slopes laid out with taste and well kept the house sheltered by plantations to the north and west  further up the river the house of mr scot is seen a pretty square building surrounded with trees on that side of the river which we passed stood a large exploratory mount which seemed to have been originally encircled by three or four several bankings or terraces ascending above each other the crown is now planted with young trees and forms a pretty object from the gentlemens seats on the opposite side of tweed  within some little distance further up the river we viewed a circular fort which as it remains the most entire of any we saw on this tour and will give a full idea of those which we passed similar in form though less perfect i have given a kind of birdeye view of it    this camp or rather fort has been formed from a natural eminence the crown is exactly circular and level with a rampire of earth on the verge having an aperture or entrance toward the east of the width of    paces the rampire rises about six perpendicular feet from the level of the interior plain from the foot of which rampire the plain is near    paces diameter i paced the top of this rampire and found the whole circle to be near  00 paces in the interior plain not exactly in the center but inclining to the southwest is the foundation of a stone wall forming a square of equal sides    paces each this probably was the apartment of the general or other officers or a storehouse for arms and valuable effects the height from the top of the upper rampire to the next level is nearly    perpendicular feet and as steep as soil or turf can possibly be supposed to lay the level here for it can scarce be termed a fosse the rampire on its edge only forming a breastwork is nine paces wide this second rampire only makes a part of a circle its points terminating on the brink of a very high precipice overhanging the river the top of this rampire extends   0 paces the height from the top of the second rampire to the next level is about    perpendicular feet of as steep an ascent as the former this level or fosse is only six paces wide the lowest or third rampire only forming a breastwork to the interior level but from the common plain is six feet in height composed of stones without any mortar its points also terminate on the edge of the precipice and its top measures   0 paces so that the whole mount appears about    perpendicular feet high the form of this fortification renders it probable that the chief persons of the army who lay here with their valuables were placed on the crown of the eminence and that the lower trenches were occupied by the troops according to the nature of their arms the heavyarmed soldiers in the lower intrenchment those armed with missile weapons on the second and third levels by which position on an attack the garrison could fight as from a theater stage above stage and when forced from the lower trenches could still retreat to a station of superiority these are improperly called camps they seem not calculated for encampment but as forts for a secure resort  i presume this fortification was originally danish but to what part of the dark history of those times it may belong i am totally ignorant  when we had arrived within about four miles of mailross we had a prospect of the ruins of  dryburgh abbey   seated on a promontory on the banks of tweed under a lofty hill which defends it from the north we did not approach nearer to it than the opposite shore from whence it made a good appearance emerging from a thick wood the principal part now standing is supported by fine clustered pillars mr pennant who crossed the ferry to view it says on the northern side of tweed in the deep gloom of a wood are the remains of the abbey of dryburgh founded by hugh morvill constable of scotland in the time of king david i and beatrix de campo bello his wife there are scarce any relics of the church but much of the convent the refectory supported by two pillars several vaults and other offices part of the cloister walls and a fine radiated window of stonework these remains are not inelegant but unadorned this was inhabited by praemonstratentian monks who styled the irish abbeys of druin le crox and woodburn their daughters at the reformation king james vi bestowed dryburgh on henry erskine second son of the earl of mar whose house as commendator is still inhabited  in the reign of edward ii      the english on their return from an incursion in which they had penetrated the country as far as edinburgh burnt dryburgh having first pillaged it of its wealth  the country as we approached mailross showed a gradual decrease of proper husbandry as well as an inferior quality of soil we arrived at the town of  mailross seated in a deep valley in which the abbey was concealed from the eye till we were just upon it but when through the trees we gained a view of its east window the elegance of the structure astonished us  we hastened to the inn and with all the impatience of curiosity approached the sacred pile on the southern side the view from the entrance into the churchyard is noble this church is in the form of a cross the south end of the transept presented itself in front the arching of the doorway is composed of a semicircle with various members of the most delicate work falling behind each other supported on light and wellproportioned pilasters on each side is a projection of rich tabernaclework the corners of this end of the structure are composed of angular buttresses terminated by spires of tabernaclework these buttresses are pierced with niches for statues the pedestals and canopies of which are of the lightest gothic order and ornamented with garlands of flowers in piercedwork from the manuscripts of the late roger gale esquire the following account was communicated to roger gale esquire by mr francis drake of york norham   th july      sir i could heartily wish that some judicious brother of your antiquarian society was but to see a gothic rarity that is in this neighborhood viz the beauteous ruins of the abbey of mailross which i shall take upon me to say has been the most exquisite structure of its kind in either kingdom i wont say but other abbeys have been larger such as st albans and some conventual churches more august as beverley but this of mailross is extravagantly rich in its imagery niches and all sorts of carving by the best hands that europe could produce at that time nay there is such a profusion of nice chiselwork in foliage and flowers at the very top of the steeple that it cannot be seen from the ground without the help of a glass the capital of every pillar that supports the arches of the church and the doors are all hollowed with a small tool being wreathedwork of all sorts of flowers such as you have at the entrance of your chapter house at york every brother has had a stall in the cloister now much demolished which have been variously adorned with the leaves of fern oak palm holly or some other kind of trees  the building from the steeple to the east end is entire in the walls but the roof which has been of stone and carved is much decayed  the quire is but small but has a noble east window the glass all out therein lies a marble stone without any inscription half a hexagon tapering smaller at the foot of a bright green color and powdered full of white feathers  the whole structure is in the form of a st john of jerusalems cross the north and south ailes pretty complete at the north side of which is a staircase that has led into the priors house  from the steeple westward remain six arches of the nave in which is the present kirk that takes up about three of them but how much further the ancient church has extended i believe will be hard to know  in every arch of the nave both north and south has run a cross wall into the two side ailes making so many sacella each with an altar and holy water pot  the windows are of an equal dimension but variously figured and carved  the cloister has been on the north side of the church which opened into a garden that led to the tweed that is there of a good breadth and there was another garden on the opposite side of the river our neighbors are not wanting in the faculty of amplifying but this thing does really exceed all their exaggerations of praise by this you will sneer and say i have lived too long here and am become as vain as they however i stand to my assertion  there is printed an upright of this abbey that is ill done i could wish there was not only an exact whole plate but also a view of the east end with a distinct draught of the doors columns capitals and some of the finest images which are so well finished to the life that dr king of oxford who has been lately to see it wished they were taken down and preserved from the weather the whole building is of a fine stone  i could wish also there was an exact ichnography drawn of the whole the minister is a good sensible man a lover of this kind of antiquity and is daily studying the walls of this church he showed me some of the glass of the windows which is of an uncommon thickness not stained through but painted upon  if by this mean effort your society could be prevailed upon to take this structure into their consideration i know not how far the scotch gentlemen are engaged in their monasticon scoticum i have gained my end especially if you will vouchsafe me the favor of an answer to this who am dear cousin  yours affectionately f drake p s you know our st cuthbert was educated at this abbey over a door is a date of the work and the name of the architect mr brownewillis has had an account of this abbey sent him      above the south gate are several melross abbey niches for statues decreasing in height as the arch rises in which some mutilated effigies remain many in standing positions others sitting said to represent the apostles but by their apparel i conceived they were representations of the patrons of the church in the center are the arms of scotland a lion rampant in reverse with a double tressure above which is the effigy of john the baptist to the waist suspended on a cloud casting his looks upward and bearing on his bosom a fillet inscribed ecce filius dei this is of very delicate sculpture and in good preservation on the buttress east of the door is the effigy of a monk suspended in the like manner supporting on his shoulders the pedestal of the nich above in his hands a fillet is extended on which is inscribed passus e q ipe voluit read passus est quia ipse voluit on the western buttress is the like effigy bearing a fillet inscribed cu venit jesi seq cessabit umbra  cum venit jesus sequitur cessabit umbra these two sculptures are of excellent workmanship to the westward of this last effigy is the figure of a cripple on the shoulders of one that is blind well executed under which you read uncte dei above the south door is an elegant window divided by four principal bars or mullions terminating in a pointed arch the tracery light and collected at the summit into a wheel the stonework of the whole window yet remaining perfect this window is    feet in height within the arch and    in breadth the mouldings of the arch contain many members graced with a filleting of foliage the outward member runs into a point of pinnaclework and encloses a nich highly ornamented which it is said contained the figure of our lord there are eight niches which sink gradually on the sides of the arch formerly appropriated to receive the statues of the apostles the whole south end rises to a point to form the roof garnished with an upper moulding which is ornamented with a fillet of excellent rosework the center is terminated by a square tower  it will suffice to remark in this place that the pedestals for statues in general are composed of five members of cornice supported by palm boughs or some other rich wrought foliage and terminating at the foot in a point with a triple roll the caps or canopies of the niches are composed of delicate tabernaclework the spires ornamented with mouldings and a fillet of rosework and the suspended skirts graced with flowers the interior of the canopy is of ribbedwork terminating in a suspended knot in the center this description will do to carry the readers idea to every particular nich without my running into the tediousness of repetition  at the junction of the south and west members of the cross a hexagon tower arises terminating in a pinnacle roofed with stone highly ornamented from thence the aile is extended so as to receive three large windows whose arches are pointed each divided by three upright bars or mullions the tracery various and light some in wheels and others in the windings of foliage these windows are separated by buttresses ornamented with niches here are sculptured the arms of several of the abbots and that also of the abbacy a mail and rose these buttresses support pinnacles of the finest tabernaclework from the feet of these last pinnacles are extended bows or open arches composed of the quarter division of a circle abutting to the bottoms of another race of buttresses which arise on the side wall of the nave each of these last buttresses also supporting an elegant pinnacle of tabernaclework are ornamented with niches in two of which statues remain one of st andrew the other of the holy virgin the side ailes are slated but the nave is covered with an arched roof of hewn stone from the west end of the church is continued a row of buildings containing five windows divided by the like buttresses the tracery of two of the windows remaining the rest open each of these windows appertained to a separate chapel appropriated and dedicated to distinct personages and services the places of the altars and the fonts or holy water basins still remaining at the western extremity of this structure on the last buttress are the arms of scotland supported by unicorns collared and chained the motto above broken the letters egis only remaining on one side is the letter i on the other q and a date   0  which was the second year of the marriage of king james iv a marriage concerted at this abbey between the king in person and richard fox then bishop of durham  in      the fury of reformation still existing the elegant statues which ornamented this place were most sacrilegiously demolished a tradition prevails here that one of the persons so employed on striking at the babe in the virgins arms received a contusion which disabled him for ever from such useless occupation and struck such a panic on his associates that they fled and left the mischievous business unperfected  in spotswoods history of the church of scotland page     we find these works of fanatical fury thus mentioned an act was passed for demolishing cloisters and abbey churches such as were not as yet pulled down the execution whereof was for the west parts committed to the earls of arrane argile and glencarn for the north to lord james and for the incountries to some barons that were held most zealous  thereupon issued a pitiful vastation of churches and church buildings throughout all the parts of the realm for every one made bold to put to their hands the meaner sort imitating the ensample of the greater and those who were in authority no difference was made but all the churches either defaced or pulled to the ground the holy vessels and whatsoever else men could make gain of as timber lead and bells were put to sale the very sepulchers of the dead were not spared the registers of the church and bibliothekes cast into the fire i award all was ruined and what escaped in the time of the first tumult did now undergo the common calamity which was so much the worse that the violences committed at this time were colored with the warrant of public authority some illadvised preachers did likewise animate people in these their barbarous proceedings crying out  that the places where idols had been worshipped ought by the law of god to be destroyed and that the sparing of them was the reserving of things execrable as if the commandment given to israel for destroying the place where the canaanites did worship their false gods had been a warrant for them to do the like the report also went that john knox whose sayings were by many esteemed as oracles should in one of his sermons say that the sure way to banish the rooks was to pull down their nests which words if any such did escape him were to be understood of the cloisters of monks and friars only according to the act passed in the council but popular fury once armed can keep no measure nor do any thing with advice and judgment  the east end of the church is composed of the choir with a small aile on each side which appear to have been open to the high altar this part is lighted by three windows toward the east and two side windows in the aile the center window is divided by four upright bars or mullions the traceries are of various figures but chiefly crosses which support a large complicated cross that forms the center the arching is pointed and part of the tracery here is broken the side lights are near as high as the center but very narrow divided by three upright bars or mullions the mouldings of the window arches are small and delicate yet ornamented with a fillet of foliage on each side of the great window are niches for statues and at the top there appear the effigies of an old man sitting with a globe in his left hand rested on his knee with a young man on his right over their heads an open crown is suspended these figures i presume represent the divine personages the buttresses at this end terminate in pinnacles of tabernaclework the mouldings and sculptures are elegantly wrought  the north end of the cross aile of this abbey is not much ornamented without it having adjoined to the cloister and other buildings the door which leads to the site of the cloister the building being demolished is a semicircular arch of many members the fillet of foliage and flowers is of the highest finishing that can be conceived to be executed in freestone the same being pierced the flowers and leaves separated from the stone behind and suspended in a twisted garland in the mouldings pinnaclework and foliage of the seats which remain of the cloister i may be bold to say there is as great excellence to be found as in any stonework in europe for lightness ease and disposition nature is studied through the whole and the flowers and plants are represented as accurately as under the pencil in this fabric there are the finest lessons and the greatest variety of gothic ornaments that the island affords take all the religious structures together  the west side of the center tower is yet standing it appears to have supported a spire a loss to the dignity and beauty of the present remains to be regretted by every visitant the balconywork is beautiful being formed of open rosework the present height of the tower wall is    feet  the length of this edifice from east to west is     feet the cross aile     feet and the whole contents of its ichnography     feet  we entered at the south door and no expression can convey an idea of the solemn magnificence which struck the eye the roof of the north and south ends of the transept remains supported by intersecting groins in various directions of the lightest order the joinings ornamented with knots some sculptured with figures and others of piercedwork in flowers and foliage the arching of the interstices constructed of thin stones closely jointed over the choir part of the roof of like workmanship still remains the side ailes are formed by light clustered pillars richly capitalled with garlands of flowers and foliage disposed delicately in the mouldings in some the figures of animals are interspersed the pillars which supported the tower toward the east are gone so that three sides of it are down leaving a chasm through which you look up toward the remaining quarter  the north aile is lighted by a circular window representing a crown of thorns which makes an uncommon appearance here are the effigies of peter and paul one on each side the tower but of inferior sculpture  it is said alexander ii king of scotland lays buried at the high altar and that an inscription denoted his tomb ecclesiae clypeus pax plebis dux miserorum rex rectus rigidus sapiens consultus honestus rex pius rex fortis rex optimus rex opulentus nominis istius ipse secundus erat annis ter denis and quinis rex fuit ipse insula quae carneri dicitur hunc rapuit spiritus alta petit caelestibus associatus sed melrossensis ossa sepulta tenet  but no such inscription is now to be found there is a marble tomb the form of a coffin on the south side of the high altar but it bears no inscription and is supposed to be that of waldevus the second abbot who was canonized the chronicle of mailross contains this anecdote that ingerim bishop of glasgow and four abbots came to mailross to open the grave after    years interment when they found the body of waldevus uncorrupted on which with religious rapsody they exclaimed vere hic homo dei est they afterward placed a marble monument over the remains  many of the noble line of douglas lay here among whom is james the son of william earl of douglas who was slain at the battle of otterburn and interred with all military honors lord liddisdale who was styled the flower of chivalry he fell a victim to the jealousy of william the first earl of douglas and was assassinated his eulogy in the life of the douglasses p    styles him terrible and fearful in arms meek mild and gentle in peace the scourge of england and sure buckler and wall of scotland whom neither hard success could make slack nor prosperous slothful de valoniis vauxs somervils balfours and many other men of note lay in the chapter house  upon the wall on the left as you enter the south aile two inscriptions strike the eye cut in the old english letter over one of which a compass is extended they are as follow i so gayes the compass even about so truth and laute do but doubt behald to the end  john murdo ii john murdo sum tym callit was i and born in parysse certainly and had in kepying all masom werk of santandroys st andrews the hye kyrk of glasgu melros and paslay of nyddysdayl and of galway pray to god and mari both and sweet st john keey this haly kirk from skaith   whilst my companion was drawing his view i wandered in this hallowed spot till decline of day the evening advanced with an unusual solemnity the clouds which were struck with crimson reflected the beams of the setting sun into the interior parts of the building and made the whole glow with a purple ray the idea struck me that celestial ministers apparelled suitable to the weakness of the human eye accompanied me to walk the ruined aile the thought was sufficient to inspire a contemplative traveller with meditations as serious as the human mind is susceptible of to add to this disposition the wind blew a brisk gale and gave a mournful melody every object was solemn and every thought devout who could forbear exclaiming thy ministers incessantly accompany us they involve us as with this ray of light they penetrate the eye and read the images of the mind before they have utterance they bear witness of our frailties and rejoice in our virtues perhaps by so exquisite a touch that human sense cannot distinguish it they carry on their operations by those propensities for which we are unable to account and influence our resolves and struggle with our proneness to evil that we may not deviate from thy laws millions of spiritual creatures walk the earth unseen both when we wake and when we sleep   how often from the steep of echoing hill or thicket have we heard celestial voices to the midnight air sole  or responsive each to others note singing their great creator often in bands while they keep watch or nightly rounding walk with heavenly touch of instrumental sounds in full harmonic number joined their songs divide the night and lift our thoughts to heaven these sad remains of human glory how are their beauties defaced thus pass away the mighty things of the earth to the eye of him to whom ten thousand years are as one day what vanity is the magnificence of men here forgotten of the world lay in the dust princes and nobles whose titles authority and power are vanished as the baseless fabric of a vision if spirits visit their terrestrial abodes for it is not the will of our father which is in heaven that one of these should perish here perhaps wander heroes who languish over their unexpiated crimes men of religious orders who mourn the depravity of the human race and the desolation of their temple where once all human energy was breathed in prayer if spirits visit their terrestrial walks and leave for a time that ineffable beatitude proclaimed to us that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of our father which is in heaven  perhaps  alas it is too true i lost a friend perhaps his expanded essence fills this ray that penetrates the gloom rejoices in the thoughts which rise upon my mind conveys my prayer to the divine propitiatory prompts each virtuous fervor and subverts all rising impropriety perhaps with that pure affection which he possessed when living on earth he looks upon my countenance commiserates the darkness of my faculties that here are laboring for pleasure or for knowledge  my eyes grew full of tears my heart heaved in tumult my hands were grasped through energy of thought and i stood as a statue when the approaching foot of my companion roused me preserving my mind from a growing extravagance of imagination which was already replete with the most affecting images  in the morning at sunrise we again returned to these splendid ruins which had even occupied the visions of our sleep we yet had to take a survey of the nave of the church which is now used for worship on opening the door it is not to be expressed the disagreeable scene which presented itself this place is filled with stalls in the disposition of which irregularity alone seems to have been studied some are raised on upright beams as scaffolds tier above tier others supported against the walls and pillars no two are alike in form height or magnitude the same confusion of little and great high and low covers the floor with pews the lights are so obstructed that the place is as dark as a vault the floor is nothing but the damp earth nastiness and irregularity possess the whole scene the fine workmanship of the pillars whose capitals for flowers and foliage exceed all the rest of the building the ribs of the arches and the ornaments of their intersections are scarce to be seen in the horrid gloom which possesses the place  what idea concomitant to religion can dictate filthiness and confusion in a house of worship i know not by magnificence and splendor the eye may be diverted but in that elegant simplicity in which cleanness and plainness are associates the mind abstracted from attention to worldly things will be yielded to uninterrupted devotion all reformation has been attended with extravagance bigotry grows up into passion and from one extreme the zealot rushes into another when the pomp of romish worship was to be corrected the scotch sunk into the deepest reverse many of the old churches in scotland which i have seen are filthy and foul one of the allotments of the cathedral of st andrews in the city of glasgow appropriated to parochial duty is even in the burial vaults in the foundation of the structure without light but what issues through little loopholes near to the pulpit where the minister sits to teach his parishioners who are lodged in outer darkness but for uncleanness and irregularity this place exceeds them all i have had dreams of confusion in my youth but never formed even a diseased idea like this it looks like the house of lunatics it is unparallelled and defies all language to give it a description superior to every thing but the incongruities of a bedlamites disordered fancy  but to more moderate matters here are several tombs of eminent personages on the north wall is inscribed under a coat armor here lies the race of the house of zair many altars basins for holy water and other remains of separate chapels appear in the ailes among which are those of st mary and st waldave  the sentiments which arose to me whilst i walked or rather staggered about in this strange scene were much to this effect i premised that true religion consisted of that devout fervor of mind which gives its ideas to the divinity full of gratitude for his benevolence and longsufferings full of admiration of that majesty and mightiness which are displayed through all his works and from a true consciousness of mans demerits and the imperfections of his judgment full of patience humility and resignation when a man who is possessed of such disposition of mind puts up a prayer it is only for mercy and protection in whatever class of religious men we find these premised principles best preserved we may determine with justice that there the true devotee is distinguished modes of religion are its corruption the acceptations of a country or the prescriptions of a peculiar set of men may be salutary to the community in general but in no wise conducive to the devotion of the individual religion has its essence from the liberty of the mind formularies maxims modes or dictions are disguises which in the robe confound the spirit are fetters that bind down the fervor of the mind if the truly devout heart breathe out lord have mercy on me a sinner there is more religion in that short sentence so uttered than in ten thousand ave marys a million of liturgies and the frippery of establishment charity is as unbounded as the regions of heaven and beset with as many gems as the galaxy charity says the truly religious of every age nation custom profession and mode are acceptable to the divinity for it is not the mode but the spirit that approaches the regions of life when i tread the walk of antiquity i venerate the pious works of the heathen the servant of the deity is to be revered let his service differ never so wide from the establishment of which i am a member it is the essence of the act that i sever from the defilements of custom we judge and may be judged we think we are right so did the ancients the druid the amonian in his acts of piety is to be regarded without the errors of his sunshine services he worshipped the deity under the symbol of the sun an object in nature the most reasonably adopted as the image of the creator or as the throne of his majesty  the roman scattering salt and meal on the crackling coals and making his libations to the divinity under the type of some of his attributes is also worthy of our reverence the errors his modes admitted through charity are exempt from judgment and his real piety is estimated divested of defilements which were contracted from the errors of the age  the jewish pomp and ceremony the tumultuous and noisy sacrifice the greasy services and bloodbespattered altars are all forgotten when we trace the religion of the mind and the piety of the devotee  the magnificent rites of modern rome loose their pageantry and sink upon our estimate when we compare them to the cell of humiliation where piety leaving the eye of men retires to solitudes and the recluse confessing the frailties of nature with purity of soul avows all the religious confidence of faith we at once turn from the echoing dome and the acclamations of a choir of eunuchs to seek this holy devotee the man who communes secretly with his own soul who puts off the formulary and presents in his solitary cell a genuine confession and the spirit of prayer before his god whose presence is universal  the reformist protesting against the errors of others like the scriptural image of imperfection plucks not the beam from his own eye though less pompous in his service yet he remains as ceremonious our reformed church of england has retained too much of the popish spirit and custom which tends to the destruction of rational piety and true christian worship monthly review sept      page   0 all attitudes are admitted to his devotion by intervals except the original one the eastern attitude that prostration which expresses the utmost humiliation his liturgy is filled with repetition whilst there is surely no want of subject for supplication when many supposed mediators were to be addressed repetition was attended with some reason these are taken away but the reiteration continues when the reformist breathes the sighing of a contrite heart he gains with the devotee of every denomination an acceptance which depends not upon modes  the presbyterian avoids much form but admits much slovenliness much indolence and more negligence yet the inward spirit which would have been devout in any other class of religious is the same worthy devotee in this apparel  the silent quaker sits meditative his mind unoccupied by fashion or form is open to natures dictates in all their simplicity he perceives the glow of devotion the moving spirit warms his soul and the heart conceives what the divinity accepts though unuttered by the lips the fanatic would in the utmost agitation be in action the bramin be in torture but this religious brings offerings of peace his god is the god of tranquillity it is the service of the spirit is acceptable the offices of the body are appropriated to corruption to fashion and the follies of the world  the canting hypocrite who goes about announcing wretchedness and breathing anathemas on mankind is to be treated with pity and an apothecary  religion is replete with pleasures and not burdened with terrors she brings forth the most placid hope and her hope is accompanied with inexhaustible images of joy popes distich as to modes of faith is infallibly true his sure is best whose life is in the right religion is in the manners and not in modes of prayer  but to return to my subject  in one of the ailes of this part of the church is an inscription cut in a fair letter but of what import i cannot discover nunam katine thome pauli guthb te s petr k etigin   the ancient monastery of mailross is said to have stood originally a mile from the present ruins but by whom founded is uncertain  one house marks the place on a lofty promontory peninsulated by the tweed a most beautiful scene the banks lofty and wooded varied with perpendicular rocks jutting like buttresses from top to bottom this was the site of the ancient abbey of culdees mentioned by bid to have existed in     in the reign of the saxon oswy this place was as celebrated for the austerities of diricthelmus dryethelme had a cell assigned him in the most retired part of the convent that he might be less disturbed in his continual devotions and the place itself being situated on the bank of the river he used often for the sake of mortifying his body to go down into it and plunge in the stream there he continued praying and singing psalms as long as he could the water sometimes coming up to his loins and sometimes as far as his neck and when he came out from it he never thought of casting off his wet and cold garments but wore them till they grew dry and warm on his body in the winter when encompassed with crusts of ice he continued this mortification sometimes breaking the ice to make room for his standing or dipping bid lib   c    as ever finchal was for those of st godric the first was restored to life after being dead for an entire night during that space he passed through purgatory and hell had the beatific vision and got very near to the confines of heaven his angelic guide gave him an useful lesson on the efficacy of prayer alms fasting and particularly masses of holy men infallible means to relieve the souls of friends and relations from the place of torment pennant   the scotch who are ambitious of antiquity attribute it to columbus some more moderate say its original patron was aidan bid says it was seated on the banks of tweed that the churches at that time were built of oak thatched with reeds and that the religious of this house maintained themselves a long time against the canons and ordinances of the romish councils on a peninsula formed by the river you are shown the site of old mailross with the foundations of the wall the porters lodge the chapel know and many other places appertaining to that house together with the remains of a bridge over tweed nennius who lived as some authors assert in   0 but according to others in     speaks of this monastery as a place of great note and probably it was destroyed by the danes when they ravaged this country bid gives the names of some abbots here eata the first he was succeeded by boisil who according to dempster died in     st cuthbert succeeded boisil but afterward quitted this monastery and went to lindisfarne he was succeeded by etholwold this is all i can collect of old mailross the house of which these celebrated ruins are the remains was founded by david king of scotland in the year      it was endowed with large revenues and many immunities as appears by the charters granted to the abbot and convent by the kings of scotland in a manuscript said to be deposited in the colbertine library giving an account of the several religious houses founded by king david it is mentioned sed melrossensum praecipue inter omnes ecclesias and fideliter defensabat and dulciter diligebat and suis opibus exornabat mr hay says it is recorded in the book of taxes of the apostolic chamber that king david bestowed thereon    0 florins the original charter of foundation was confirmed by his son prince henry and intimates that he gave to this abbey the whole lands of mailross eldun of dernewie galtownside galtownside haugh and galtownside wood and many privileges in the forests of selkirk and traquair particularly betwixt galla and leeder the charter also expresses that these lands had been perambulated by the king in person accompanied by prince henry with richard the first abbot the date of this charter is the second year after stephen of boloign king of england was taken prisoner which must be in the year      the witnesses are hogo de moreville william de somerville gervasus riddel etc  the date of the foundation appears in this monkish distich anno milleno centeno terquoque deno et sexto christi melrose fundita fuisti by the foundation charter the dedication appears to be deo and sanctae mariae de mailross and monachis ibidem deo servientibus de riavallis etc of the cistercian order yet the church was not dedicated till the year       richard the first abbot was installed in the year      the year of foundation he was succeeded by walterus or waldevus a son of king david who was afterward elected bishop of st andrews but refused episcopacy to him many miracles were attributed to relate one will suffice  in a great famine about  000 poor people came to the convent of mailross for relief whom waldeve the abbot pitying he went with his cellarer or butler tyna to his grange at heldwii and then to gattonside and having put in the staff which he carried in his hand among the corn it was increased through the sign of the cross both for the supply of the convent and all these numerous poor he received canonization and many rich offerings were made at his tomb  joceline a man of great learning was abbot here he was afterward made bishop of glasgow but chose mailross for the place of his interment one laurentius was a succeeding abbot also ranulph in      who by the legate of pope innocent iii was made bishop of down in ireland  we find this monastery like all others very busy and warm in secular matters the pious legate was at mailross to determine a dispute between this abbey and calehow and to his dishonor it is said he took the fee of office and left the case undetermined and in      the abbot and a great many of the society and dependents of this monastery were excommunicated by a council held at perth for an affray with the men of wedale in which a clergyman was slain and many persons wounded  in   0  william the  th abbot of mailross died this was the   th year after the death of st waldeve william was equally esteemed for his sanctity and on his death it was resolved that their bodies should be laid together as the workmen were preparing williams grave brother robert who was a mason a lay brother by the incitement of some of his associates but not without reluctance and much religious horror raised the cover of waldeves tomb when there issued a fragrance as if the grave had been filled with spices being in the gloom of the evening he brought a candle to the aperture all who were present beheld the sacred body entire and all the vestments as fresh and beautiful as when first put on there were six monks and as many laybrothers who had the happiness of gratifying their pious though presumptuous curiosity fordun l   c      in the year    0 the bones of the abbots of mailross that lay in the entrance of the chapter house were taken up and more decently buried in the eastern part of the same chapter house all excepting the bones of st waldeve whose sepulcher was opened and his body found at last crumbled into dust those who were present carried off some of the small bones leaving the rest to repose in peace one of the company was william son to the earl of dunbar and nephew to the king a knight of great fame he begged and obtained a tooth of the saint by which he is said to have wrought many cures  in      one patrick then abbot swore fealty to king edward i  robert of kindalach a monk and abbot of dunfermline and chancellor of scotland was abbot here also  john foggo confessor to king james i of scotland and  andrew hunter lord high treasurer and confessor to king james ii of scotland  duroys and foggos appear in the same list and also james stuart eldest natural son to king james i he was abbot of kelso and also of mailross and died about the year      after him cardinal de guise was nominated but never installed  this monastery suffered many injuries in the wars between scotland and england in the year      it was pillaged by the troops of king edward ii whose inglorious expedition was marked with disgrace by the burning this and dryburgh abbey and murdering a company of monks king robert bruce for its restoration gave in the year       000l sterling with many forfeited estates king richard ii again burnt this monastery and in the reign of king henry viii it was pillaged and laid waste sir ralph ivers and sir bryan layton having obtained a grant of merse and tiviotdale on their coming to take possession were opposed by archibald the  th earl of angus at ancrum moor and suffered a shameful defeat the ground where this battle was fought is called lilliards edge from the singular valor of a woman who was on the side of the scotch over her place of interment was erected a monument with this inscription fair maiden lilliard lies under this stane little was her stature but great her fame on the english lads she laid many thumps and when her legs were off she fought upon her stumps   mailross was a mother church to all of the cistercian order in scotland the monks wrote a chronicle of this house beginning at     and continued down to    0 it had many endowments besides those of king david particularly by king alexander ii the family of stuarts and others in the year      the revenue appeared by the account then taken to be as follows in money      l per annum wheat     chalders   bolls bear     chalders

scotia pulcherimum and opulentissimum  after the reformation the abbey of mailross was granted by queen mary to james earl of bothwell who forfeited the same it then came to the family of douglas one of whom was created earl of mortan under whose hands all the evidences of this abbeys possessions were preserved and are now in the custody of that family a grant was made of it to john ramsay by king james vi and confirmed by parliament as a reward for preserving the king against a traitorous attempt by lord gowry he was created lord haddington and afterward made a peer of england by the title of earl of holdernesse it came afterward to sir thomas hamilton who was created earl of mailross in      and assumed on that occasion three roses in his coat armor he afterward took the title of haddington the abbey with its demesnes were lately purchased by the family of buccleugh  many large buildings have stood within the walls of the monastery whose remains yet appear  in returning from mailross we passed  newstead a little village at the distance of about a mile from the abbey noted for a lodge of free masons whose antiquity is believed to be cotemporary with the monastery at least but some presume to trace it to a much greater distance from its vicinity to the helton mountains which entertained a druid tribe whose traces are evident to this day here are the foundations and remains of a house belonging to the knights templars called red abbey stead  the name of a peculiar spot on the middle helton mountain with a traditional account that it was sacred to jupiter and was a possession of the druids induced us to visit these lofty hills we advanced to the summit of the center hill a rise of about a mile and half the place called aborjo of which there is such tradition engaged us some time our guide said that in former times it was girt with a grove of oaks and fenced with a trench and vallum of earth the vestiges of the trench remain but the grove is no more abor was a name given by the amonians to the great luminary and signifies the parent of light in mr bryants work we have the following definition  this luminary was also called abor the parent of light and his temple choabor of this name both a city and river were to be found in gauzaintis as well as in susiaria and other parts  aborjo is an easy corruption of aborcho being a mere transposition of the titles  on the top of the northeast mountain are the traces of a large encampment mr pennant says on one of these hills is a roman camp and that he had been informed of others with military ways to be traced in various places i am apt to conjecture mr pennant took this account from a little pamphlet sold at mailross describing that place and its environs and did not visit it himself the place has not the form or appearance of a roman camp it has been an occasional fortification not a permanent one the climate and exposure of the situation will not allow a conjecture that it was designed for a continued stronghold the breastworks are of earth defended by moles at irregular distances a mode not practiced by the romans in the beginning of ethelwolds reign oswin who claimed the crown as his right of inheritance levied forces to recover it this was the scene of a decisive engagement oswin having fortified himself strongly at length determined to put his claim to the issue of battle the fight continued for three successive days beginning on the  th of august     but the event was fatal to oswin and his adherents oswin dying in the field it is most probable these fortifications were of the above date when the disposition of the crown of northumberland was determined by the event i have mentioned  king alexander iii levied a great army in      which rendezvoused at mailross where the king continued some time there is scarce an eminence on these borders but what bears the marks of warfare from the northeast eminence there is a most extensive and beautiful prospect commanding all the vale of tweed down to berwick a fine though distant view of tiviotdale the northern and western views are rugged and mountainous  after repassing kelso we arrived at  coldstream having kept the northern side of tweed the views on this ride were open and beautiful we passed the seat of dr johnston finely covered with wood also the seat of lord hume around which extensive plantations of young firs are arising and already have an excellent effect upon the landscape the elegant house of mr majoribanks by coldstream loses half its beauty in want of wood  end of the first part appendix

majesty yet is seized of and in the franchise and liberty of exam and examshire lying within the body and middle of the county of northumberland which said liberty and territories when it was in the hands of the said archbishop was commonly termed and called a county palatine where in right or proof there was none such yet by reason of that error ever since and yet there has been and are diverse opinions besides some question and doubt whether the liberty and territory of exam and examshire should and ought to be part of the said county of northumberland or otherwise exempted and whether the dwellers and inhabitants there should and ought to be justifiable and answer to justice as others of the said county of northumberland are and ought or not and the like question and doubt yet is and remains by reason whereof not only pleas of the crown and suits betwixt party and party suffer continues stays letts and also have no end of trial and besides the most and greatest offenders to the crown and their country have and daily run thither as to a sanctuary upon hope and trust of refuge thereby to the great comfort and encouragement of many the vilest and worst subjects and offenders in all the north parts and to the great offense of the almighty and most manifest hinderance of good execution of law and justice  in and for the due remedy and redress of such great enormities and apparent mischiefs may it please the queen her majesty that by her highness the lords spiritual and temporal and the commons in this high court of parliament assembled it may be enacted manifested and declared by the authority of the same the said territories franchises and liberties of exam and examshire with the liberty of the same may be is and shall be from henceforth taken to be within and
