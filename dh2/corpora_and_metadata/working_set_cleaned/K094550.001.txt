mdcclxxiv  to the right honorable the lord cambden my lord i must not make any apology for claiming your lordships patronage for the following work it is a claim of right the spirit of it is your own i caught it by long and close attention to your lordship and now that it is let loose into the world it naturally flies back to its parent for protection if i have been so happy as to make the body worthy of such a spirit that is all the merit i pretend to  i am with attachment and respect my lord your lordships most humble and most obedient servant charles johnston  may         preface in this enlightened age when men judge intuitively of all things it may not be improper to say a few words concerning the following work if only to save critical sagacity from the misfortune of being led astray by the title  in the history of the prince of betlis there is not one soft scene of love one sentiment of loose desire outrageous virtue is never gratified with anecdotes of private scandal nor licentiousness flattered with the sacred name of liberty  it must not though be concluded from hence that arsaces is a mere moralist or held up as a pattern of perfection a monster which nature never formed he is drawn as he was with all his faults upon his head subject to the power but not the slave of passion and speaks with freedom the sentiments suggested by the occasion whether gay or grave of reprehension or applause  to wipe off the false colorings of prejudice and show truth in her native purity is the writers aim how he has succeeded is not for him to say there is at least some merit in the attempt and upon that he humbly rests his fate  amid the variety of incidents with which our heros life was filled the learned reader may probably not be displeased to find some curious points of history brought to light which have too long lain in undeserved obscurity nor will he be offended at the writers not having paid more minute attention to the manners of the times and countries in which the various scenes of his work are laid he has endeavored to draw the universal manners of nature which suit all climes and ages greater particularity would have been only pedantry  contents of

accounted for page     the history of arsaces prince of betlis book the first section i as temugin was riding through his army on the morning after his victory over mohammed had added the mighty empire of khouaresm to his boundless conquests he observed among the captives of the war a youth just sinking under a double weight of chains while the dignity of conscious virtue shone through his distress and showed a soul superior to misfortune  temugin was struck with the sight and calling to the leader of the band which guarded the captives enquired who that youth was and how he had merited such severity  lord of the earth answered the soldier this slave deserves every cruelty which can be inflicted on him he it was who yester evening slew the valiant togrul and by his obstinate resistance for some time delayed the victory which crowned your arms  say rather returned the captive with a look and accent of indignant contempt that i supported faithfully the cause in which i fought and disdaining life without its greatest blessing liberty strove though alas in vain to lose both honorably together  the manner in which the captive spoke these words heightened the favorable impression which his appearance had before made upon the heart of temugin take off his chains said he and lead him to my tent i will examine him more particularly when i shall be at better leisure  the soldier instantly obeyed and the captive prostrating himself before the emperor expressed his gratitude for a favor which darted a ray of hope through the gloom of his present situation  other cares prevented temugin from thinking more of this adventure for the remainder of that day but when he retired in the evening to rest the idea of the captive recurred to his mind and took such strong possession of it as to forbid every approach of sleep calling therefore one of the eunuchs who watched at the entrance of his tent he commanded him to order his attendance  as soon as the captive entered i have sent for thee said the emperor to learn the story of thy life what is thy country thy lineage and thy name and by what actions have thou supported the sentiments which i have heard thee utter with such energy arise speak the words of truth and expect a candid hearing  conqueror of the world answered the captive as he arose from the emperors feet the incidents of a life of misfortune will afford but little entertainment to one who is raised above the reach of such himself as they cannot interest a sympathetic regard  no state interrupted the emperor is exempt from the common lot of humanity nor is he capable of enjoying happiness himself who is insensible to the sufferings of another  the captive replied not but seating himself on the ground at the foot of the emperors couch began in these words  section ii my name is selim i come from the valley of amoim in arabia the happy where the wisdom and virtues of abudah my father procured him in a private station a respect more sincere than that which is usually paid to wealth and power much had he read and thought still more he had also traveled through many nations and by a comparison of their manners dispelled the prejudices which too often spread a cloud over a contracted sphere  but he was stopped in his pursuit of knowledge by the nearer duties of domestic life the cultivation of his mind had refined not extinguished the passions of nature he viewed in a light of just contempt the mistaken imperfect happiness of celibacy and in obedience to the first purpose of his creation took a wife into his bosom  heaven seemed at first to smile upon his marriage bed but the blossoms of his hope were soon blasted the hour which gave him a son depriving him of a wife  severely as he felt this loss he sunk not under it reason succeeded the first emotions of nature and his piety trembled at the apprehension of offending heaven by repining at its irresistible decrees  pardon gracious lord this mention of a father to whom life is my least obligation it is a necessary introduction to the story of my misfortunes it is a tribute to his memory which nature will obtrude through all restraint  disgrace not reason answered temugin by making an excuse for virtue duty to a father as it is the foundation so also is it the best assurance of loyalty to a sovereign a good son cannot be a bad subject  proceed  the love resumed the captive wiping away the pious tear which trickled down his cheek which abudah had felt for his wife was transferred to her wretched orphan and doubled the force of paternal affection as soon as he had paid the last debt of humanity to her beloved remains he laid me in his bosom and turned his steps home to his native land where his tenderness well supplied the loss i had sustained  his first care was to lay a foundation for that health which is necessary for the enjoyment of life and the performance of all its duties he taught me to feel no wants but those of nature whose inevitable imbecilities were not aggravated by injudicious fondness hunger sweetened the most simple fare and exercise made me find refreshment in sleep which was never allured by luxury nor indulged to enervating excess while my body gradually inured to the vicissitudes of the seasons required not the voluptuous encumbrance of clothing to screen it from the severest inclemencies of weather my food was vegetables i drank of the brook and i wore no clothes but barely what the laws of decency demanded  yet intent as he was on establishing my health his care was not confined to that alone as soon as the first dawn of reason began to enlighten my mind he directed my thoughts to such objects as necessarily led to wisdom and virtue he imprinted upon my soul a just sense of the obedience which i owed to the author of my being by explaining to me my dependence on him he taught me to read the sacred proofs of his wisdom his goodness and his power in the tremendous volume of his works the stars of heaven showed me the glory of their maker the sun by day and the moon by night bore witness to his power my soul was humbled before the lord of the universe and adored the goodness which incessantly supports the creatures of his hand  as the life of man is designed for action he would say all knowledge which leads not to the practice of virtue is but vanity  while my mind therefore was expanded by these sublime speculations he explained to me the principles and reason of every duty of social and civil life proving that obedience which arises not from conviction of the justice and necessary obligation of a law has no more real merit than the habitual servility of a brute animal  he then unfolded to me the complicated relations in which man stands to man both as an individual and as a member of a community and from them deduced all the various duties of either state the highest degree of perfection would he frequently say to which the human nature can arise consists in the imitation of the divine which is possible only in benevolence and constitutes the essence of all the moral social and civil virtues however varied in their appearances in the various circumstances and connections of life from the peasant in the field to the prince upon his throne  the example of his actions enforced the precepts of his wisdom and led me insensibly to practice the virtues he inculcated as rising years afforded ability i suffered hunger to feed the hungry the feeble and aged found a support in the strength of my youth and i rushed into danger to rescue the distressed  nor were his instructions limited to the narrow sphere of our private station as the powers of my mind became capable of more extended exertion he raised my view to higher scenes he traced government to its origin in the general welfare and happiness of mankind the source from which ultimately and equally flow the different but reciprocal duties of subjection and command and reconciled their apparent oppositions on the unerring principles of reason  the avidity with which he saw my soul imbibe the instruction of his words made him happy power my son he would say the tear of paternal tenderness and pride glissening in his eye was originally conferred as a reward of superior merit and virtue and still the hand of heaven does often most unexpectedly raise from the cottage to the throne the man who is found worthy to govern it is a duty therefore to qualify ourselves to fill properly whatever station is appointed for us  in the pleasing illusion of these fond reflections he unfolded to me the ordinances of peace he taught me the arts and inured me to the toils of war that general happiness he said which was the cause and should be the invariable aim of sovereign power can be enjoyed only in the shade of public tranquillity the cultivation of which therefore as it is the first duty so is it the true glory of a prince but then as the follies and vices of mankind make it impossible always to maintain that most desirable state it is also indispensibly necessary for him to be able to repel injustice and assert his rights by war of which however as these are the only just motives so when they are accomplished he should never let revenge avarice or a passion for false glory inflamed by the deceitful smiles of success urge him to pursue it farther he should never forget that his foes are his fellow creatures that his very victories are purchased with the inevitable miseries of his own subjects  but whither do i fondly run why should i repeat the maxims of an humble minded recluse to the conqueror of the world  proceed answered the emperor i am attentive to thy words the sentiments of thy father were suited to his station had he been a sovereign he would have thought otherwise  section iii my mind had followed the words of my father continued the captive without difficulty or doubt while he explained the duties of life upon the principles of reason and truth but when he descended from them to the practice of mankind when he came to speak of the causes and consequences of war the scene was changed i lost the awe of divine justice which had led me hitherto and wandered in the perplexing labyrinth of human life i saw nothing but contradictions in the ways of man all professed to seek happiness but wilfully turned away from the paths which led directly to it all professed virtue but practiced vice  false shame should i not rather call it pride would not permit me to disclose the difficulties in which i was entangled to my father i thought i could struggle through them by the strength of my own mind without betraying my weakness by having recourse to his assistance a presumption justly punished by all the miseries i have suffered since  destitute thus of the guide who had always led my steps in safety i attempted in vain to grope my way through the darkness with which i was enveloped on every side i attempted to trace consequences to their causes but the attempt still left me in greater uncertainty i saw vice triumphant i saw virtue depressed i was utterly at a loss to know whence this could proceed if from good why was the contrary prescribed if from evil why was it permitted my mind was perplexed with many doubts i attempted to measure the ways of heaven with the line of human reason but it was too short and the more i thought of the subject i was only perplexed the more in so much that i was at sometimes almost tempted to doubt whether virtue and vice differed more than in name whether heaven really interfered in the government of the world or left it merely to chance  as i sat one evening on the bank of the rivulet which runs through the vale of amoim wrapped in these speculations my senses were suddenly overwhelmed with sleep and i saw as in a vision a being such as the celestial spirits who watch over the actions of mankind are represented to be standing beside me  regarding me for some time with a look of reprehension softened by pity son of abudah methought he said in a voice which thrilled my soul thy unhappiness is beheld with compassion i come to put a stop to researches which if pursued too far would overturn reason thy knowledge is only speculative thou see man but as in a mirror and do thou attempt to investigate all the mysteries of his nature vain presumption first look into real life nor pretend to judge of the substance from the shadow  saying this he vanished from my sight and at that instant i awoke  it was some moments before i recovered from the extatick awe with which this vision struck me starting up at length and continuing the illusion of imagination i looked eagerly around for my kind instructor and could hardly believe that i had seen him only in a dream  nor did the discovery put an end to that illusion i considered the words of my father that heaven often opens its will in the visions of sleep when the soul freed from the clogs of sense is more capable of entering into intercourse with the spiritual beings which continually surround us though imperceptible to corporeal sight  and i looked upon the reverential awe with which i had been overpowered as an incontestible proof that the being i had seen was my better angel sent to me with a command from heaven to which it was my duty to pay implicit and instant obedience  but this obedience was attended with difficulties of the weightiest nature against the will of my father i was sensible that it would be impious to begin in vain to expect success in any undertaking and the anxiety he always showed if the ardour of the chase or any other accident detained me out of his sight only a few minutes longer than he expected left me no room for hope that he would consent to my plunging thus alone into the difficulties and dangers of the world  in a cooler moment this reflection would have been sufficient to deter me from any attempt but my soul was now on fire and inclination cooperating with the power of imagination proved too strong for reason i thought i only preferred the superior duty expressly commanded by heaven when i resolved to leave my fathers house that very night and launch into the boundless ocean of life without giving him any notice of my design an expedient by which i flattered myself that by avoiding an express inhibition i evaded the crime of direct disobedience never remembering the maxims invariably inculcated by him that candor is of the essence of every virtue and that no good in the end proposed can justify any evil in the means made use of to attain it  vain as this evasion was it silenced all my scruples and i attended the call of my father to our evenings repast with a serenity in my looks which my heart was far from feeling  but my soul soon shrunk back from such deceit and i dared not to meet his eye or return with equal warmth the kiss of love with which he sealed his benediction when he dismissed me as he fondly hoped to rest inauspicious omen alas too strictly fulfilled by the unhappy event oh where was then my guardian angel why had not my soul some presage that this kiss would be the last with which i should ever be blessed by him that thought would have opened my eyes and brought me back to reason and to virtue   a flood of tears here choked the utterance of selim he hung down his head and sobbing aloud gave vent to the grief with which the recital of this unhappy event had overcharged his heart while temugin kindly sympathizing with him interrupted not the pious offering of filial duty and affection  section iv nature at length being relieved by this indulgence the captive thus continued having but few wants i required little preparation for my intended expedition as soon as my father retired into his own tent to rest i girded on the sabre and mounting the horse which he had provided for me to learn the exercises of war departed without having so much as considered whither i should direct my steps  but my infatuation was too strong to permit my attending to any thing beside completing my escape i therefore traveled forward during the whole night without bestowing one thought on the folly and danger of such an undetermined state or stopping even for a moment till the appearance of day reminded me of the duties of religion when alighting from my horse and sprinkling my face with an handful of sand for i had no water to perform the ablution i offered up the prayers of the morning  break not your narrative thus by enumerating the performance of religious duties interrupted temugin we will suppose them always regularly performed the captive bowed his head in obedience and proceeded  the sacred awe which always accompanies acts of devotion stilled for some moments the tumult in my mind and turned my thoughts in upon myself i started at the first glimpse of my situation which now began to open upon me i dared not to look back and before me all was darkness and dismay  i paused to consider how i should proceed but before i could determine upon any thing the power of determining for myself was taken from me a troop of bedouins rushed from the covert of some trees near to which i had stopped and seized me as i lay prostrate on the earth  all the horrors of my situation instantly arose to my view the more than brutal ignorance and barbarity of those lawless ravagers of which i had heard too many melancholy instances left me but little hope of favor at their hands however in the instinctive impulse of selfpreservation i threw myself at the feet of their leader and embracing his knees conjured him to take compassion on my youth and suffer me to return to an aged father whose gray hairs the loss of his only son would otherwise bring with sorrow to the grave  but i prayed to the winds instead of being moved by my entreaties the ruffian spurned me from him with his foot and nodding to his followers they instantly bound my arms and putting me on my horse led me away with them  what i now felt at the thought of being thus torn probably forever from the arms of my father suggested to me the anguish of his soul on missing me that morning i saw though too late my crime in its proper colors i owned the justice of heaven in my own fate and only grieved for the unhappiness with which i had overwhelmed him  but i was not suffered to indulge such reflections the rapidity with which the ravagers hurried me along kept my spirits in involuntary motion and the novelty of their manners excited a curiosity which in some degree diverted my attention from my own distress  on a division of the captives of the expedition i fell to the lot of the leader of the troop by whom i was appointed to the lowest offices in his squalid economy but i repined not i remembered the words of the prophet that the days of man are numbered and the events of his life written on the table which stands before the throne of god from the beginning of the world  i therefore humbled myself before heaven and submitted without murmuring to its decrees  nor did this resignation to the divine will pass without reward it was taken by my master for a willing acquiescence under his authority and in a short time gained me his good opinion so far that he set me over the other slaves of his household  section v the first use which i made of my new authority was to lighten the yoke of bondage upon my fellowcaptives they received sufficient sustenance their labors were suited to their strength and capacities and their souls were not wounded by unmerited insult or reproach  the consequence soon justified this conduct the work of our master was performed to his satisfaction and he slept in safety among slaves who had no cause to wish him evil  but i was far from enjoying such happiness as they seemed to feel at this change of their condition my soul impressed with the deepest sense of piety and virtue was shocked at such an absence of both as degraded man below the level of the brutes which perish and i trembled with fear that the force of example might infect my heart and sink me down to their degenerated state moral virtue and religion my father had often and most earnestly inculcated to me are so essentially connected that the one cannot exist without the other of the truth of this maxim i had abundant proof in my present situation  as the revelations of the divine will vouchsafed as guides to reason in matters above the investigation of its own powers were either utterly unknown or at least so corrupted as to bear no resemblance to the sacred originals so were the very rules of conduct and mutual intercourse invariably imprinted by the hand of nature on the human heart for the most part effaced among them their knowledge of a deity was uncertain and debased with notions contradictory to those principles of his essence which open themselves to reason in its first efforts for beneficence or gratitude they had not even a name and justice was no farther known or regarded by them than as it served the convenience of preserving their respective property and having that recourse to force among themselves by which all their disagreements with others were decided  though the horrors inseparable from slavery were aggravated an hundred fold under such masters i never lost hope nor slackened my assiduity in the execution of the trust committed to me i will do my duty said i whenever despair began to steal upon me and depend upon the justice of heaven a resolution which by keeping my thoughts employed prevented them from brooding over my own unhappiness and thereby enabled me to support its weight  the effects of my management soon became too evident to remain unnoticed though my master who held it beneath him to look so low was the last to perceive the change awakened at length from his inattention he gazed around him in stupid amazement and enquiring the cause of what he saw opened his eyes and mouth into a broad stare while i explained the reasons and instanced the advantages of my conduct then awkwardly relaxing his features into the first smile of complacency they had ever felt expressed something like approbation  nor did he stop here he represented me in so favorable a light to the tribe that looking upon me now as one of themselves they admitted me to accompany them in their excursions for prey an honor never before conferred upon a captive  section vi though such a course of life was equally contrary to the principles instilled into me by my father and to the disposition of my own heart the hope of one day regaining my liberty and returning to him which it seemed to open to me outweighed every other consideration and strengthened my hand on several occasions in such a manner as gained the approbation of my new companions  i had not been long in this state when in one of our expeditions we happened to fall in with a caravan so numerous and well provided for defense that it appeared madness in us to attack them  but the prospect of rich plunder overbalanced every thought of danger and we fell upon them with the fury of wild beasts enraged by hunger rather than like human creatures  the event was such as the rashness of the attempt deserved and we were repulsed with the loss of more than half our number  as i was not blinded by the same passions with the rest of our troop i had presence of mind to effect our retreat after they had all given up every hope of it the importance of which service raised me so high in their opinion that their leader being among the slain they conferred his post upon me  this seeming honor only added anxiety to additional fatigue for as they pay implicit obedience to the orders of their leader during their excursions the care of conducting which is thrown entirely upon him so every failure of success is imputed to him as a crime and exposes him to worse than brutal outrage  but the fascination of command made me blind to every objection and i entered upon my new office with all the eagerness of inexperience encouraging myself with this reflection that at any rate it was better to rule than to serve such savages and that i should have it in my power to direct their motions to the way most favorable to my escaping from them  as i saw that disappointment of the plunder sat heavier upon the survivors than the loss of their fellows i considered whether it might not still be possible to compass by stratagem what we had failed of by force and revolving in my mind various schemes i at length hit upon one which proved successful  for some days after our defeat we hovered about the caravan unable to bear the thought of quitting it and giving up our hopes though we could see no prospect of obtaining them  having advanced thus a considerable way into the desert a strong wind arose one morning just after the caravan had begun to march this incident instantly suggested to me what i had hitherto wearied my thoughts in fruitless search of  drawing our people out in a single line at some interval from each other i led them above the caravan in the wind and galloping rapidly along we raised a cloud of sand which the wind poured down upon them in a torrent horrible to imagination  as soon as i had reached the end of the caravan in this manner i turned off with the foremost of my followers and taking a sufficient compass to avoid incommoding our own men i was time enough back in the rear to continue the line as the last begun to move  having repeated this as long as i thought it possible for human nature to support it we attacked them in the midst of their distress when sinking under what they had suffered and concluding from the manner in which i had kept up the line that our numbers must be many times greater than they were they lost all spirit and made but feeble resistance  it was impossible for me in the first transports of victory to prevent a carnage to which the inequality of numbers unhappily gave the appearance of necessity but as soon as their fury began to cool i exerted myself to put a stop to that and all the other outrages too generally offered to captives  the booty gained on this occasion was so great as for some time to satisfy desires which had never known bounds before a circumstance most favorable to my farther designs  when the captives were secured the next thing was to take measures for our safe return home which it was far from being easy to effect as we were liable to be attacked by the other troops of bedouins who range these boundless deserts and make no distinction of persons where there is a prospect of prey  as this care fell entirely upon me i resolved to execute it in such a manner as to procure the liberty of as many as i could of the captives whose lives i had saved accordingly when all things were in readiness for our march i selected those whose youth made them best able to bear the yoke of slavery and then dismissed the rest in peace with provisions sufficient for their journey an act of humanity unknown to the bedouins whose custom it was to slay all such captives as they thought useless to them  the dispositions i made for our march and the vigilance with which it was conducted secured our retreat through the midst of many dangers several troops of much superior force having met us on our way but deceived by our appearance they did not dare to attack us  section vii though the authority of the leaders of those tribes has relation only to the conduct of their excursions and ceases at their return home i flattered myself with a fond hope that the great service i had done them would procure me an influence which might enable me to do them services still greater by enlightening the brutal ignorance of their minds and humanizing their manners  i was not insensible of the difficulties and dangers of attacking prejudices grown sacred by long use and that ignorance always captious seldom fails to revenge the imaginary affront of instruction but the thought of success was so pleasing that i was not to be discouraged from the attempt by any apprehension  the first thing necessary for accomplishing my design was to select some person on whom my instructions might be bestowed to best advantage that he might assist me by communicating the information he should receive and recommending it from his own experience nor was i long at a loss whom to choose khaled the son of my late master was the one in the whole tribe with whom i had the greatest intimacy whether from the circumstance of our having lived together while i belonged to his father or that my having once saved his life at the imminent hazard of my own had attached him to me with him therefore i resolved to begin not more encouraged by our intimacy than because i thought i perceived in him something more like that rational curiosity which is the first incitement to knowledge than in any other of the tribe  the only science of which the bedouins had even the faintest conception was that which regards the motions of the heavenly bodies but though the clearness of their hemisphere and the circumstance of their being obliged by the heat of the sun to perform the greatest part of their occupations in the night gave them the most favorable opportunities for pursuing this study to advantage they had made no farther progress in it than barely what was necessary to direct their steps through the pathless desert where they could have no landmarks to guide them in their way on this science therefore as that most likely to interest their attention i proposed to found my attempt  for this purpose i took occasion to enter into conversation with khaled as if accidentally on the various appearances of the heavens and beginning with the first rudiments of the science led him as it were step by step up to the creator of them proving the necessity of his existence from the existence of his works and his wisdom his power and his goodness from the wonderful construction and support of them  having thus established in his mind the first principle of religion in the belief of a deity i proceeded to deduce from thence the duties of piety and moral virtue but my endeavors in this latter instance were far from being attended with equal success  while my instructions had been confined to matters of mere speculation he listened to me with willing attention and not only assented to truths which interfered not with the tenor of his life but also exerted his utmost assiduity to communicate and inculcate them to others  but when he saw that an utter change in his whole conduct was to be the consequence that passion was to be subjected to reason and justice made the rule of action no evidence however clear and conclusive was of force sufficient to combat habits pleasing in practice and as it were sanctified by long and general reception on the contrary from that moment he withdrew his confidence from me and i soon found that he counteracted instead of assisting my endeavors  though i was well aware of the difficulties which this defection of khaled threw in the way of my designs i was too sanguine in the pursuit to be deterred by it and resolved to try whether i could not effect by example what i had failed of by the force of reason taking care to commence with such things as from their obvious advantage in a political as well as rectitude in a moral light i concluded must necessarily command instant assent  section viii the loss sustained in the late expedition had reduced the numbers of the tribe so low that they were obliged to remain at home for fear of being overpowered by some of the other tribes whom they might meet in their excursions  as they were sensible of this disadvantage the severest to them of which  had any sense i judged that an  to remedy it must be embraced with the greatest readiness and joy  though the violation of the marriage bed was guarded against among them by every preventive care every terror of punishment the female sex before that bond was abandoned to the most shameless prostitution  criminal as this custom was the method taken to remedy what were looked upon to be the only bad effects of it was still a greater crime the wretched fruits of this licentious commerce were exposed to perish in the desert without regard to the duty of paternal tenderness or the welfare of the community thus robbed of its support  against a practice so contradictory to nature as well as to reason i urged every argument which either could suggest and to give weight to my words began the reformation of it among my own slaves branding with a mark of infamy every female persisting in promiscuous prostitution and obliging every male to rear and maintain by extraordinary labor every infant assigned to him  though as i have before observed the public advantage was as obvious as the private virtue of this regulation a general outcry was instantly raised against it the unmarried of both sexes exclaimed that they were robbed of the liberties and rights of nature and the whole tribe declared against the intolerable tyranny and crime of such an innovation which as they alleged would compel people to rear children against their wills and contrary to their convenience  it is impossible to express what i felt at this utter disappointment of hopes upon which i had so strongly set my heart i now too late remembered what i had often heard from my father that though it is the duty of every person and especially of those whose station may give influence to their example to live according to the dictates of reason and virtue yet a general reformation of manners is not to be too sanguinely expected from the most eminent example or best concerted scheme if the circumstances of the times are not assisting but when these cooperate the most inconsiderable and improbable means are found sufficient to accomplish the greatest ends  but my thoughts were soon diverted from these reflections to matters of nearer concern to me  the charge of making innovations in their established customs was looked upon to be so atrocious a crime that they resolved instantly to put a stop to it by the most exemplary punishment in order to deter any future presumption of the kind for which purpose they suddenly surrounded my tent and having seized me before i could attempt either defense or escape were proceeding to drag me out of the camp in order to stone me to death when i owed my safety to a principle from which i had never expected to receive so great a benefit  khaled who had totally estranged himself from me for some time and was now become one of my loudest accusers no sooner perceived their intention than he rushed out of the crowd and claimed me for his slave as having been the property of his father  i availed myself of the momentary check which this claim gave to their fury to speak in my own defense i demanded to know my crime and my accusers i pleaded my services i called upon their gratitude i argued upbraided and besought but all equally in vain my voice was drowned in the cry of innovation which was roared from every mouth and without deigning to make any other reply they directly gave me up to khaled to return to a state of slavery from which i was deemed unworthy to be freed seizing upon my slaves and every thing which belonged to me as public property or rather i should say as proper objects of public rapine  as soon as the crowd was dispersed i turned to khaled and thinking he had devised this claim only to save my life was advancing to embrace him in testimony of my gratitude but i was soon undeceived without showing the least concern for my misfortune or even taking notice of ever having known me before he ordered me to be thrown into a kind of dungeon where they were wont to keep such slaves as were found unserviceable to them till a certain season of the year when they disposed of them and such other parts of their spoil as they had no occasion for themselves to merchants whom they went to meet for that purpose in exchange for matters of more immediate use  these occurrences were far from clearing up the doubts which had been the cause of my leaving the bosom of my father on entering the dungeon my soul shrunk in upon itself in horror if this be real life said i better did it appear in the mirror of speculation more favorably was the shadow to be judged of than the substance   it was some happiness to me however not to be left long to these reflections that very evening a party of the bedouins set out to meet the merchants and took me with them among the other useless lumber which they wanted to dispose of when khaled showed his proficiency in knowledge and virtue by the value he set upon his instructor giving me in exchange for a wallet made of the skin of an ass  section ix the merchant whose property i thus became thinking he saw something in my appearance not unworthy of his favor as soon as the arabs had concluded their markets and departed asked me in a humane manner for what fault i had been sold at so low a price  as my tongue knew no language but that of truth i not only informed him of what he enquired but also of the first motive and manner of my leaving my father and the end proposed by my travels to all which he listened with attention and then told me when i had concluded that these were matters about which he had never concerned himself that all his care was to buy and sell as well as he could and that he was content to take the world as he found it without enquiring farther into the actions of men than as they might affect his own interest  contracted as these sentiments then appeared to me i was soon sensible of the advantage in my change of situation my new master had much experience of the world and its ways and where a view to interest did not interfere formed just conclusions from what he saw  the conversation of such a man which i enjoyed in the most unreserved intimacy sweetened the bitter cup of slavery affording me pleasure and instruction at the same time without attempting to trace motives or consequences he related plain facts and in them supplied a kind of artificial experience unincumbered with those disquisitions which for the greater part only obscure what they pretend to illustrate and are more apt to mislead than guide reason to the right way  one evening as i was sitting by myself in his tent indulging the fond hope which my masters favor seemed to open to me of returning to my father he entered and seating himself near me selim said he i have observed your demeanor ever since you have been with me and see that your wisdom much exceeds your age i have therefore resolved to consult you on an affair which gives me much anxiety and if your sentiments concur with mine shall be glad of your assistance to carry them into execution  i have followed this painful profession of a merchant with various success for many years without being ever able to acquire a sufficiency for the support of old age in comfort and decency often indeed have i thought myself within sight of the end of my wishes but some unforeseen misfortune has as often disappointed my hopes a reverse which i have too much reason to apprehend at this time  in the course of my present journey it has been my fortune to purchase a female slave of such exquisite beauty and rare accomplishments that i may well expect to sell her to the sultan of cairo whither i am now going for so high a price as shall make the rest of my days happy if her own perverseness does not prevent me  an invincible melancholy has preyed upon her heart from the first day of her coming into my possession she keeps a gloomy silence which neither threats promises nor entreaties can prevail upon her to break she turns away with disgust from every attempt made to entertain her and the sustenance she takes is so little that it shows she wishes to shorten the number of her days  such a conduct alarms me with apprehensions not only of missing my expected profit but also of losing the great price i have given for her a loss which i can not bear what i have to propose to you therefore is that you will strive to insinuate yourself into her confidence i am not insensible of the danger of such a trust but i know your discretion and depend upon your virtue  i suspect that her heart fosters some secret grief if it could be discovered means might possibly be found to administer alleviation to it at least will you then try to make this discovery the human heart finds comfort in the communication of it is woes and if you can once engage her attention i have no doubt but she will open herself to you   there was something so uncommon in the nature of this proposal that it raised a curiosity i had never felt before totally engaged in the pursuit of knowledge under the eye of my father i had never had any particular intercourse with the female sex nor formed any notion of that power which nature has given them over the heart of man  i had a desire therefore to see a woman on whom were founded expectations which appeared to me so extraordinary and readily undertook a commission with the dangers of which i was unacquainted if i should not rather say that the mention of those dangers was my first motive for undertaking it as it seemed to promise an opportunity of raising myself still higher in the opinion of my master by my surmounting them  section x the first time i saw her she was sitting in her tent with her eyes fixed upon the ground and motionless as if the action of every sense was suspended  struck with the sight i gazed on her and while my eyes eagerly devoured her beauties thought i was only studying how to address her in the manner most likely to answer the hopes of my master  i had stood thus for some moments melting in sensations utterly new to me when the fair slave not having perceived my entrance exclaimed with a sigh which seemed to burst her heart unhappy sappho to what new misery am i reserved   the sound of her voice awoke me from the ecstasy in which i had stood entranced throwing myself eagerly at her feet lovely sappho said i seizing her hand and pressing it to my heart unfold the cause the nature of your unhappiness and depend upon every effort in the power of man to make for your relief  her surprise at so unexpected an address deprived her of utterance for some moments recovering at length insidious man said she tearing away her hand with indignation to intrude upon my solitude in order to steal the secrets of my soul but your base arts shall not avail in my name you know more than i ever intended to discover but more than that shall you never know  saying which she wrapped herself in her veil and resumed her silence which my most passionate entreaties could not prevail upon her to break  this repulse threw a damp upon my spirits which i knew not how to account for i was surprised at what i felt i questioned my heart whence it could proceed and at length resolved it into my anxiety to serve my master heightened perhaps as i thought by compassion for so fair a creature  this thought encouraged me to proceed with double assiduity in the execution of the task assigned me i walked beside her camel as she traveled beguiling the way with tales of entertainment and verses which i hourly composed in praise of her beauty i lulled her to sleep with songs of love and consolation  such a conduct could not fail to affect an heart naturally susceptible of the tenderest impressions she relaxed her reserve she received my services with complacency and admitted me to a familiarity which was soon improved into that tender kind of friendship which can subsist only between the different sexes  as i was walking one evening by the side of her camel conversing with her on indifferent subjects she dropped some expressions of surprise at my never having shown any curiosity to know who she was or by what means she had been brought into her present unhappy state  this was an opening which i had anxiously watched for i replied that far from being incurious about any thing which concerned her my heart panted with the eagerest desire to know every incident of her life in hope of making some discovery which might suggest the means of removing her unhappiness but that i had been kept silent by respect and fear of awakening that grief which i had the pleasure to see in some measure beginning to subside  thanking me for my delicacy she said with a reprehensive smile that her griefs were too deeply imprinted on her heart ever to be forgotten but though she could not flatter herself with the faintest hope of its being possible for me to afford her relief she owed too much to my humanity to refuse gratifying me with the information i desired  saying this she paused for a few minutes to recover her spirits then wiping away a tear which accompanied the recollection of her misfortunes she began in these words  section xi my name you already know i was born in the island of mytilene of a family which never knew disgrace before i was unhappily added to it  the fondness of my father viewing in too favorable a light the poor endowments bestowed upon me by nature he spared no pains to improve them by every accomplishment of education flattering himself with the hope that they might raise me to a more exalted rank in life by alluring the affection of some of our young nobility whose own riches could enable them to consult inclination only in the matrimonial choice as he had not himself a fortune to give with me equal to his wishes  we often owe the disappointment of our designs to the very means upon which we build our most sanguine hopes of their success  the power of pleasing in which nature was thought to have been most liberal to me was my voice fond of music himself my father omitted nothing which could conduce to perfect me in an accomplishment so universally admired i was instructed in the use of every instrument i had masters of every country to modulate my voice and form my judgment and fame said that their endeavors were not unsuccessful  among these masters the most celebrated was one who had been educated in the seraglio of the khalif of bagdat the care taken in that jealous court to prevent the ministers of pleasure from abusing the access which their occupations necessarily give them to the female sex prevented also my fathers having any apprehension of danger from the familiarity of his access to me i practiced with him every hour alone in every dress and every attitude he thought proper to try as he pretended which suited best the powers of my voice  of all the pleasures of sense that which captivates the soul most strongly is music by its command over the passions it commands the heart while it silences reason by its union with sentiment  nor is this command exerted only over the hearer the feelings of the performer advance with his execution till he becomes insensibly the slave of his own art as i soon unhappily experienced  the praises which i received for my proficiency warmed my heart with gratitude to my teacher to whose indefatigable assiduity i was sensible of my being indebted for them and doubled my attention to his instructions  in vocal expression the attitude of the body naturally accompanies the sentiment my teacher practiced this to an extreme which i at first thought ridiculous and disgusting but that disgust soon wore off i saw him if i may use the expression only with my ears and found such pleasure in his voice that every thing he did pleased me  such a prepossession in his favor could not long escape his observation he perceived it too plainly and took an advantage of it equally base and absurd to attempt improving my admiration of his voice into a passion for himself  with this intent whenever we practiced alone together he chose none but the most tender themes of love for his lessons and not content with my accompanying his voice as before taught me also to imitate his looks and gestures in which he proceeded to every endearment of the passion he expressed till nature catching fire realized the imitation on my heart and i felt the flames he only acted  my soul had till now been so totally engrossed by my passion for music that i had never before felt the impulse of any other pleased therefore with sensations i did not understand i took no pains to conceal them  it is impossible to describe the rage of my father at a discovery so destructive to his hopes so fatal to his fondness for me he directly turned off my teacher in the most opprobrious manner and loading me with every reproach of ingratitude degeneracy and folly interdicted my ever seeing him with the severest menaces  nothing shows the natural right of the human soul to liberty so strongly as the reluctance with which it bears every semblance of restraint  though my heart had been warmed by the caresses of my teacher i was so far from having a confirmed passion for him that i knew not even what that warmth meant and would have rejected any direct offer of love from him with indignation but my pride was now piqued on the opposite side by this treatment from my father and i thought it no more than a just assertion of my liberty to do that which he had unjustly attempted to prevent my doing  my teacher who had found means to have intelligence of every thing which passed upon the occasion soon availed himself of this spirit of liberty should i not rather call it contradiction which my father had raised in me he requested a private interview which in the present state of my mind i made no difficulty of granting when pressing his suit with all the ardor of desire and treating the charge of its absurdity with contempt as a calumny devised only to deceive my inexperience he worked up my passions particularly my resentment to such an height that he obtained from me a promise of marriage under the sanction of the most solemn vows  section xii a moments reflection showed me all the misery into which i had plunged myself but i was not long permitted merely to reflect upon it  my promised husband could not conceal his triumph over the contempt and contumely with which he had been treated by my father the consequence of this indiscretion was equally severe upon us both he was thrown into the common prison where he suffered all the indignities and wretchedness of poverty and guilt among the vilest malefactors for having seduced a pupil whom he had been entrusted to teach for hire while my father in virtue of his paternal authority confined me to my chamber in which i was guarded with the most rigid vigilance and denied every thing like pleasure or even comfort in order to punish me for my past disobedience and bend me to his purpose of breaking the engagement into which i had entered  but this severity disappointed itself and only hardened my resolution into obstinacy though i saw all the wretchedness i had to expect with such a husband in a life of vagrant poverty dependence and disgrace i dreaded still more the scoffs of my acquaintance and the bad treatment of my family of which i had already tasted so bitterly should i remain among them  i therefore determined to feign a passion which i did not feel as the only excuse for my folly and take my fate however hard among strangers away from the slights and reproaches of my friends  i say a passion which i did not feel for upon examining my heart i found in it none of that enthusiasm that madness of love which is described as delighting in dangers and sweetening distress i found it had been the music i had loved not the man and that the connection between them had even lessened that love i had dreamed of happiness but i awoke to misery  my obstinacy at length so effectually weaned me from my fathers love that he cast me off from his care and abandoned me to my fate when the first use i made of my liberty was to fly to my teacher and perform my promise of marriage amid all the horrors of his prison  formed by nature for love the human heart sympathizes instinctively in the misfortunes too often occasioned by it this act of mine had such an appearance of the infatuation of that passion that it moved the pity of all who were not immediately interested in the honor of my family and my husband found protectors who soon restored him to liberty  our situation however seemed to be but little amended we were at liberty to go whither we listed but we wanted the means and to remaining where we were could we even have subsisted there i would have preferred perishing of famine in any other place  at length the cold hand of charity scantily enabled us to travel to the metropolis where curiosity to hear a voice which had had power to invert the laws of nature for some little time drew such crowds to my husbands performances that we were relieved from the immediate pressure of poverty  but most dearly did i purchase this relief the curiosity of the public was not confined to my husband they must also see the subject of his triumph the fool who had sacrificed sense to sound every one who patronized assumed a right to visit him i was shown from morning till night to a succession of strangers who broke in at all hours without respect or ceremony and gazed at me with as much indelicacy and insolence as if i had been a monster exhibited to sight for hire  nor did i suffer from their gazing only they insulted me incessantly with such ribbald questions and such base proposals as were an outrage upon the female character and when i ventured to express disapprobation of their behavior though in the most humble terms they treated my tears with ridicule and threatened to punish me for such presumptuous affectation as they gibingly called it by withdrawing their favor from my husband  much as i was humbled in my own eyes my spirit was not yet sufficiently subdued to submit to such usage i complained to my husband in bitterness of soul and declared my resolution to shut myself up from the sight of the world rather than suffer a repetition of it  but i was far from receiving the approbation of my conduct much less the protection i expected from him he answered me coldly that my sensibilities were too lively and took unnecessary offense that what i complained of was merely a thing of course that we must humor the caprices of those by whose favor we lived and that other women instead of being offended by the proposals made to me would have turned them to good advantage as they were indeed one of the best resources in our way of life  it is impossible to express what i felt on his saying this i thought i had before seen all the horrors of my situation but these words opened new of which i had not had the remotest conception and betrayed the infamous origin of all his base designs upon me  as soon as the fullness of my heart permitted me to speak i answered him with a look of the most poignant disdain that what he meant by his way of life i knew not nor desired to know but that mine though a life of folly and misfortune had ever been and ever should be a life of virtue and honor nor would i add to the disgrace i had already brought upon my family by departing from those principles to save myself from perishing of famine as i justly deserved  saying which i retired to my chamber nor could all his expostulations menaces or entreaties ever prevail upon me to alter my resolution  the curiosity which our strange adventure had raised was no sooner gratified than my husbands voice lost its attraction and we sunk back into our former distress for such a slave was he to the appetites which he could indulge that he always lavished his acquisitions in the instant nor ever let the wants of yesterday warn him to make provision for the morrow  i was now obliged to fly my native country and enter upon a life of vagrancy literally for a morsel of bread without the illusion of hope or gratification of passion to silence the reproaches of reason and divert my thoughts from dwelling upon the wretchedness into which i had plunged myself  the scene was the same wherever we went curiosity for he took care to make my folly known at first procured us momentary relief which was as quickly dissipated so that we were always in the extremes of poverty or profusion  my only shadow of satisfaction was that my husband desisted from his base solicitations in expectation as i soon saw that the conversation of such company of either sex as i was obliged to consort with would in time undermine my principles and reconcile me to enter willingly into all their ways  but his necessities soon became too urgent to permit his waiting for an effect of which he thought himself so secure and he completed the villainy of his first seduction by selling me for a slave to this merchant  my resentment as the base wretch never dared to see me more fell justly upon myself and i resolved to shorten the days of my misery gradually by abstinence as the least painful way but your kind consolations have shaken that resolution in the seraglio of the sultan for which you say i am destined i shall have tranquillity at least and that is the nearest approach to happiness which i have any right to hope for in this world  section xiii when the fair slave had finished i left her to recover her spirits which appeared to be exhausted by the length and nature of her story and upon considering the circumstances of it i thought i had found the object of my search in the source of her misfortunes all the evil in this world all the errors in the conduct of man said i certainly proceed from wrong education how could she escape the snare into which she was led by those whom nature and reason taught her to look upon as her safest guides with what color of justice could her father blame her for a conduct which was the necessary consequence of his own indiscretion from wrong education certainly proceed all the evils which deform human life  i was pleased with this discovery and plumed myself not a little upon the sagacity which had made it but my exultation lasted not long  but if her fathers indiscretion i continued on farther reflection was the cause of her first error was his exertion of the sacred right of paternal authority a just cause for persisting in that error for aggravating it by direct disobedience to his just command did this indiscretion of the father in giving his daughter so wrong an education  did the villainy of the husband in basely selling into slavery the victim of his base seduction proceed from errors in their education also  there is more in this matter than i was aware of i should be acquainted with every particular to be able to form a just judgment of the whole  and even if i knew all these circumstances is it safe to extend a judgment formed upon one event or one series of events to the infinitely varied tenor of human life i must suspend my opinion till i shall have seen farther into the interior principles on which it is conducted a wrong education is certainly the source of many evils but it is not equally certain that it is the source of all  though many circumstances in the story of the fair slave had necessarily lowered her in my opinion they seemed to have a contrary effect upon my heart to the compassion which i had before felt for her sufferings was now added a desire to correct the errors from which they sprung a task which i flattered myself would be as easy as pleasing from the candor with which she had confessed them  happy in this thought i entered abruptly at our next meeting into those particulars in which i thought she had been most to blame and examining them closely proved by arguments more conclusive than complaisant that all her misfortunes had proceeded from herself  though her looks sufficiently showed that this subject was far from being pleasing to her she heard me to the end without interruption when instead of making any reply to the purpose of what i had been saying she hummed a tune for a few minutes and then asked me if i had heard whether the sultan was fond of music  so contemptuous a repulse embarrassed me so much that it was some time before i could make her any answer at length bowing coldly i told her that the sultans taste was one of these secrets of the seraglio with which the voice of fame presumed not to meddle adding with a significant smile that i had pleased myself with the hopes of turning her attention to objects more worthy of it  she saw my embarrassment and seemed unwilling to increase it your intention she answered did not escape my notice but i cannot accommodate myself to it you have drawn so favorable a picture of the life led in the seraglio that i have fixed my heart upon entering into it if the sultan is fond of music i have no fear but i shall gain his favor such a conquest only can compensate for my past misfortunes and i would attempt it tomorrow if i were at liberty and able to follow my own inclinations any advice therefore which you can give me to accomplish this i shall receive with gratitude to any other purpose it will be in vain for you to advise me  so peremptory a declaration effectually silenced me i bowed my head respectfully and left her without saying another word resolved never to think of her more  i was soon sensible that the only way to fulfill this resolution was to avoid her company i therefore told the merchant what she had said to me who thanked me in the warmest terms for the service i had done him in reconciling her to his views and acquiesced in my opinion that it was not necessary for me to continue my visits to her  such a sacrifice to reason was not unattended with pain nor am i certain that i could have persisted in my resolution but that our arrival at cairo produced such an unexpected change in my situation that if the remembrance of the fair slave would at times force itself upon me it soon gave place to other objects  how unjust is the pride of speculative wisdom interrupted the emperor you were offended at her because she would not listen to advice she could not follow what could she think of but improving a fate which she could see no possibility of avoiding in reality it was you who gave cause of offense impracticable advice is only insult to the unfortunate   but stop the appearance of the morning calls my attention to other matters i have not leisure to listen to thee longer now at some other time my curiosity may possibly require the continuation of thy story in the mean while remain at thy liberty among my attendants and set thine heart at ease thou art not now among the bedouins end of the first book the history of arsaces prince of betlis book the second section i some days passed before temugin could attend to the continuation of the captives story but his curiosity though restrained was far from being satisfied the first evening he could spare from his weightier cares he commanded his attendance when he resumed his narrative in these words  from the general tenor of the merchants conversation i had been led to think his principles strictly just and generous to the best of his conception but i soon found that the difference between speculation and practice is equally great in every station of life on the third day after our arrival at cairo he fulfilled his professions of friendship and gratitude for the service i had done him by selling me as a slave to the grand vizier  i must not however in justice to him omit a particular circumstance which happened on this occasion when he was delivering me to the vizier he told me as an excuse of his disappointing the hopes of liberty which he had always given me that it had not been his intention to sell me but the vizier who had been pleased with something in my appearance offered him so high a price that he could not possibly refrain from accepting it for you know he concluded that it is a rule with us who live by buying and selling never to refuse a good offer  this excuse took effect though not in the manner it was intended it gave me such a contempt for the man who made it that i left him with pleasure though to continue in slavery  the accounts which i had received from my father of the perfection to which every power of human art and genius had been carried in egypt had raised my curiosity so high to see the country that i almost forgot the wretched state in which i went thither but how was my expectation disappointed the ruins of ancient magnificence only made present misery the more remarkable the rulers prided themselves in brutal violence in the destruction of works they could not imitate and the contempt of sciences above their comprehension the people a mixture of that draff of all nations who destitute of principle or sentiment ramble from their native homes and submit to all the insults and oppression of foreign tyranny for the sordid sake of scraping up wealth which they dare not enjoy had neither leisure genius nor spirit to cultivate either art or science  my soul sickened in the contemplation of such degeneracy i would have preferred returning to the bedouins in the desert to remaining in a country once the pride of nature had i been master of myself there was a possibility at least that those savages might be reclaimed in time but here every thing was evidently growing worse nor could imagination set bounds to their fall when the height from which they had already fallen was considered  but i was soon delivered from the pain of such contemplations in less than a moon after i was sold to the vizier he was deposed and strangled and all his property confiscated to the use of the sultan  in the dissipation usual on such occasions it fell to my lot to be given to an officer who was sent the very next morning to execute a like sentence on almanzor the brother of the late vizier who commanded the egyptian army on the confines of biledulgerid and took me in his train  as it was necessary to the success of his commission that he should execute it before the fate of the late vizier should come to the knowledge of his brother to put him on his guard as his great abilities and virtues had endeared him so highly to his troops that they would to a man have defended his life with their own we traversed the inhospitable desert of barca with the utmost expedition  section ii on the fourth morning of our journey as we sat upon the bank of a river to refresh nature after so severe a fatigue we were surprised at the sight of a troop which came pouring down upon us from every side  the state of universal war in which we knew the rovers of those deserts live with all mankind left us no room to doubt of their intentions at the same time that their numbers showed it was in vain to attempt resistance  in such a situation there was not a moment to deliberate i sprung instantly upon my horse whom i had learned from the bedouins never to quit and calling to all those who preferred death to slavery to follow me i plunged into the river but not above three or four followed my example the rest stupefied by the affright and fond of life even in its most abject state not daring to make so desperate an effort to preserve their liberty  the rapidity of the stream hurried me away with a violence which soon diverted my attention from every thing but the immediate danger of my life thrice was i swallowed in the whirlpools which foamed among the rocks that broke the current of the river but the strength and spirit of my horse to whom i clung in the instinctive impulse of selfpreservation after i had lost sense of every thing else bore me through to the opposite shore  when i had recovered myself a little and returned thanks to heaven for so signal a mercy i looked wishfully around for my companions but all in vain however as i had been borne by the torrent out of the view of the enemy i lingered awhile on the bank to see if they might not happily have gained some other part till at length losing every shadow of such hope and growing apprehensive that the rovers might find some safer place to pass the river and pursue me i turned about and plunged into the pathless wilderness ignorant whither to direct my steps  i proceeded thus guided only by despair till the approach of night when the roaring of the various beasts issuing from their dens in search of prey warned me to provide for the safety of the present moment however dreadful the farther prospect which lay before me accordingly fastening my horse to the root of a lofty tree i climbed its summit and imploring the divine protection disposed myself to rest among the branches in the best manner such a situation would admit  nature was so exhausted by the accumulated fatigue which i had undergone both in mind and body that i soon sunk into a profound sleep in which i lost for some happy hours the remembrance of my misfortunes  at the approach of morning when my senses were refreshed and the faculties of my mind had recovered their vigor i saw a vision and in the power of imagination beheld the same celestial being which had appeared to me in my dream the morning before i left the house of my father  selim methought he said regarding me with a look of reprehension from thine own presumptuous folly have arisen thy misfortunes let experience teach thee wisdom thou art now launched forth into the great ocean of the world pursue thy course steadily through it under the direction of reason nor while thou shall merit its protection by virtue fear being deserted by that power which has hitherto so eminently protected thee remember that though the days of man are numbered and the hour of his death appointed from the beginning the manner of that death depends upon himself whether in infamy or glory   my vision was broken off as he spoke these words by a most tremendous noise at which i instantly awoke when the first object i saw was an hugelion which had just seized upon my horse and was tearing him piecemeal  the distress with which i was affected at this sight is not to be expressed the sense of my dreadful situation deprived thus of my best assistance to traverse those boundless wilds was heightened by gratitude to the noble creature which had so lately saved my life i wept in the weakness of my soul and was tempted by despair to precipitate myself upon him and either revenge or share his fate  but a recollection of the words which i had just heard in my vision prevented my being guilty of such rashness i considered that the dangers which made my present prospect so terrifying were yet less immediately terrible than those which i had so lately escaped and gathering hope from thence i implored a continuance of the divine protection and resigned myself with humility to the dispensations of heaven  this restored my mind to some serenity and enabled me to consider which way i should direct my course as soon as the departure of the lion should permit me to descend from my place of safety but so many obstacles presented themselves on every side that reason could find no hope whereon to form a choice  in this perplexity it occurred to me at length to pursue the journey in which i had been engaged and strive to join if possible the army of almanzor though with a different intention from that with which i had been sent  no resolution which was not absolutely impossible could have been attended with greater difficulties i had still an immense tract of this inhospitable wilderness to traverse i knew not my way through it i knew not even where the army of almanzor lay my only direction was that i had heard our journey pointed to the west and i imagined that the traces of so great an army would be easily discovered when once i should come into an inhabited country  on the support of this slender hope i set out accordingly as soon as i descended from the tree and traveled through the wilderness for the space of forty days without meeting the footstep of any human creature or having the satisfaction of any certainty that i was not involving myself deeper in those inexplicable wilds choosing my steps by day with the most anxious dread of the serpents and other venomous reptiles which hissed continually on every side and flying at the approach of night to some tree for safety from the various beasts whose roarings tore the air around me while i fed on wild fruits with the birds of the air except when failing of them i was forced to feed upon the birds themselves which i slew with my bow and arrows  at length even these resources failed me i was several days without meeting any fruits and consequently met very few birds which seldom resort any places but those in which they find their food  my spirits losing by degrees the support of hope sunk with my strength i thought it in vain to struggle longer with a fate which seemed inevitable and therefore laid me down to wait for death in whatever shape he should please to attack me  section iii the place i chose for this purpose was of itself sufficient to throw a gloom over the happiest mind stupendous ruins inhabited by every animal the most fierce and poisonous of the savage race and surrounded with woods almost impervious to them hung over a rapid stream broken into numberless cataracts by the fragments of the buildings which had fallen into it  imagination wearied itself in the present contemplation in reflection on the former grandeur of this scene of desolation till i sunk into a kind of slumber but the impression made upon my mind by such objects had heightened the sense of my own misery too much to permit my sleeping long i soon awoke and raising my eyes what was my astonishment to see a being whose appearance was such as must strike the most insensible heart with awe his stature arose above the common size of man his beard fell bright as burnished silver down his breast a loose vesture showed his large limbs and a staff supported him as he stooped over me  my heart almost died within me at the sight i was sensible that i was awake and wanted that intrepidity with which sleep prepares us to behold its own creatures i thought i beheld a being of another world and though despair had steeled me against every common attack of fear a sacred horror seized my whole soul and for a time suspended all its faculties  recovering at length the power of utterance defend me heaven i exclaimed my life is in thine hand  then prostrating myself at his feet o gracious being i continued of whatsoever state for my soul feels thou art above mortality receive into thy protection the most forlorn of mankind and direct me to some end of the misery under which i am now sinking  he saw the distress of my soul and reaching his hand with a look of ineffable benevolence arise my son said he arise and fear not you behold a man like yourself a man once as unhappy as you can possibly be till resignation and the lenient hand of time in some degree healed the wounds of misfortune and restored peace to my heart nature at the long disused sight of man first led me toward you and sympathy now bids me offer you all the consolation and assistance in my power  encouraged by these words and more by the manner in which the venerable speaker of them addressed me i arose and bowing my head in sign of grateful obedience for i was not yet sufficiently assured to speak i followed him toward his habitation which he showed me at some distance from the other ruins by the side of the river  it was a circular building of vast extent the walls of which had been so high that though a great part of them was fallen in several places that which remained standing was still sufficient to exclude every creature without wings nor could i perceive a place of entrance for any other as he led me all around it  i was just going to express my surprise at this when my conductor stooped and taking a ladder which lay concealed at a little distance he applied it to a narrow aperture in the wall at a considerable height from the ground into which when we had ascended he drew the ladder after him  i found myself now in a large gallery arched overhead and supported by massy pillars of the most exquisite workmanship it looked into an open space in the center of the building part of which was planted with fruit trees of different sorts and the rest cultivated as a garden and filled with various kinds of vegetables  when i had indulged my curiosity for some minutes in gazing at objects so new to me we descended into a spacious apartment under the gallery in the middle of which there arose a fountain that filled a bath of the whitest marble and with its overflowing watered the garden through which it was led in channels cut for that purpose  section iv as we advanced to the fountain we were met by a young female the sight of whom added to the wonder with which my soul was filled she was clad in a robe of blue silk which covered her whole form a net of the same color enclosed her hair which was wrapped in woven tresses round her head and shone like the plumes of the raven her eyes   hold interrupted temugin i hate descriptions of beauty they are always drawn by an overheated imagination and only make the partiality of the painter ridiculous  the captive blushed at this rebuke and looking down abashed for some moments sighed and resumed his story  she started at the sight of me and gazing with the most eager astonishment turned her eyes frequently to my conductor as if to enquire who i could be  he soon understood her and smiling at her surprise receive my child said he a stranger whom heaven has sent to enliven this solitary scene bring your guest a garment to put on when he comes out of the bath and then prepare us a repast from those stores which the bounty of heaven supplies faster than we can consume and are always best bestowed upon those who want them most  on his saying this she withdrew and returning directly with a vesture her father and i went into the bath together  when i had purified and refreshed myself after my fatigue he led me back into the gallery where she had laid for us a variety of fruits some dried in the sun and others freshplucked from the trees with a vase of living water just drawn from the fountain  my host having thanked heaven for its blessings reached me some of the fruits and encouraged me to eat by his example  having satisfied the cravings of nature and being in some degree relieved by his beneficence from the awe with which his appearance had struck me i began to recover my spirits and look around me with less embarrassment  i congratulate you my son said my host observing the alteration in my looks on the comfort which this scene of desolation has administered to your distress be not ashamed it argues not any malevolence of disposition nature receives consolation from society even in misery from the thought of not being marked for the sole object of the wrath of heaven  distress great as ever wounded the human heart first drove me into these wilds where chance directed my steps to this place the view struck me i thought such an habitation best suited to my state and that the hand of heaven had led me to it to show me the vanity of this world and all its grandeur  this reflection soothed my heart and time insensibly wore off the edge of my afflictions so far that in a few years i could say i was not unhappy nor had a wish to throw away for any thing this world could afford beyond what i enjoyed in this solitude but alas even this absence of unhappiness was too much to last i had more to suffer before i was to be released from life  but i see you are fatigued evening draws on when we must retire to rest while day confines the natural lords of these ruins to their caves i walk abroad sole viceroy of their empire but yield the more pleasant evening and cool night to the stronger and retire to this place of safety while they resume their sway  in the morning when rest shall have refreshed your overlaboured body and calmed the tumult in your mind i will lead you through some of the most remarkable places of my dominion and afterward gratify the curiosity which i see you feel by relating the occurrences of my life from a comparison of which with your own you can not fail of receiving consolation and encouragement to slight the evils of so uncertain a state  think that you lie this night among the ruins of a city once the habitation of myriads but now for ages lost to human knowledge and sleep contented and secure in just contempt of every thing which can happen in such a world  saying this he led me to another apartment in the gallery and recommending me to the protection of heaven left me to my rest  but it was a considerable time before the working of my mind would permit me to sleep the change of my state from the preceding day appeared too great and sudden to be real i doubted my senses and feared that all was no more than a fond illusion of imagination  revolving at length the whole progress of my life my eyes were opened and i saw the clue with which i had been led by heaven through the labyrinth elevated by this thought i offered up my soul in prayer and thanksgiving and resigning myself in humble assurance to the same protector soon found the blessing of quiet sleep  section v when i joined my beneficent host the next morning he saw the change in my looks and congratulated me upon it i rejoice my son said he at your having found that comfort which resignation to the will of heaven never fails to bring to a virtuous heart a placid countenance shows a mind at peace as soon as we shall have taken some food i will fulfill my promise of showing you my dominions  we then sat down and eating of some fruits which had been laid in readiness for us had there never been a less innocent banquet made in this place said he smiling it would not now be an heap of ruins  then observing that i still looked with wonder at every thing around me i see he continued that you are surprised at the structure of my habitation from ruins of the same kind which i have seen in places once under the dominion of a people from the regions of the setting sun called romans a name perhaps unknown to you i judge that this edifice was raised for the exhibition of shows to entertain the populace who after feasting in these galleries beheld with savage pleasure the fiercest of the brute creation let loose in yonder open space to indulge their natural antipathies and to the disgrace of humanity men still more brutal entering into deadly combat with them or with each other compelled by tyrant force or for the sordid sake of hire  struck with horror at such an account i could not forbear exclaiming in the indignation of my soul justly has such an abandoned people been exterminated from the face of the earth justly has a place polluted with such crimes fallen to ruin  take care my son he returned man must not presume to direct the justice or trace the wrath of heaven whose ways are all above his comprehension if the most virtuous people were brought to a strict account for their actions the most sacred places judged by what is done in them the whole earth would long since have been an uninhabited desert a scene of desolation and ruin  but let us go before the heat of the sun becomes too fierce and take a view of some of the neighboring parts of these ruins they will reconcile you to the fate which invariably attends all the works all the designs of man  at our return if your curiosity shall so require we will beguile the sultry hours of noon in the cool shade of these arches by a recital of the misfortunes which drove me thus from human intercourse  the scenes through which he led me were sufficient to humble human pride and damp the ardour of ambition in their highest flights every effort of art to elude oblivion and guard against the waste of time was here defeated in the most mortifying manner statues whose remains showed traces of the most exquisite workmanship and columns which seemed to have been built as firm as the foundations of the earth lay defaced and tumbled on each other in heaps of promiscuous rubbish  these statues said my guide seeing me struck by the sight were finished with so much care to perpetuate the name of some noted person these columns raised with such strength to eternize the memory of some famous action but so effectually has the vain design been defeated that during a residence of more than five hundred moons among these ruins never have i met in all my searches a single inscription which might direct me to the most distant conjecture even of the name of a city on the magnificence of which so much labor and cost were evidently expended never have i seen the face of an human being before yours except my own immediate companions  such reflections were too painful to be pursued i turned away from the objects which suggested them and my conductor seeing how deeply i was affected discontinued his intended walk for that time and kindly returned with me to his habitation where seating ourselves on the verge of the fountain i requested him to relate the history of his life which he began in these words  section vi though the recital i am now entering upon will lift up the oblivious veil which time has kindly thrown over my griefs and the wounds of my heart open at the recollection of misfortunes too mighty to admit of redress yet for thy sake o my son do i willingly undertake the painful task as a view of the evils inevitably incident to humanity cannot fail of administering a melancholy consolation under your present distresses and may convey instruction for your future conduct the events which rule the life of man in all its various situations arising from causes essentially alike however they may happen to differ in circumstances merely accidental  but first as my misfortunes arose immediately from those of my country and were in every sense connected with them it will be necessary for me to look back for a moment to distant ages in order to give a just view of the latter and of the causes from which they sprung  when the intestine divisions which had so long distracted the councils of the mighty city of carthage had at length made that queen of africa fall a prey to the ambition of the romans the few who remained of the illustrious house of barcas disdaining to live in subjection to enemies whom they had so often vanquished in the field and preferring liberty under the heaviest inconveniences which nature could support to all the luxury and magnificence of their enslaved country resolved to leave it and seek some happier habitation  communicating their design accordingly to as many as they imagined willing and worthy to share in it they all put themselves under the conduct of narbal nephew to the great annibal and secretly embarking their families and wealth in ships provided by him for the purpose they set sail in a propitious hour committing themselves and all their hopes to the guidance and protection of the gods of their country  the melancholy cause of their flight convincing them of the necessity of directing their course to some very distant region narbal whose genius turned to pursuits of a milder nature than the rest of his illustrious family had led him into every climate under heaven to promote the commerce of his country determined to seek a settlement on the island of serendib as the place most likely to be safe from the invasion of the romans those enemies to human liberty  sailing therefore along the coast of africa they passed the mouths of the nile and landing at calixene journied by land from thence to suez where narbal who was well known and high in respect soon procured other ships in which he pursued his intended voyage till he came within sight of dira when a violent storm of wind arose which in spite of all the skill and efforts of the mariners drove him back upon the coast of saquem i call places by their present names to avoid obscurity  a wise man turns every event to advantage narbal having landed his people to refresh them after the fatigues of the storm went to take a view of the country which he found beautifully blessed by nature and wanting only proper cultivation to make it afford all the necessaries of life the few inhabitants who had fled at his approach living poorly content with the spontaneous produce of the earth  pleased with this discovery and construing the storm as a direction from heaven he immediately chose a spot on the banks of a beautiful river the mouth of which formed a spacious harbor and laid the foundations of a city which he named byrsa in pious remembrance of the revered place of his nativity whose unhappy fate made him afraid to adopt the inauspicious name of carthage  misfortune had softened the minds of this new people and taught them all those duties of humanity which are too often neglected in the high blood of a prosperous estate the tenderness with which they treated such of the natives as happened to fall into their hands whom they constantly dismissed with presents soon won the love and confidence of all the neighboring people so far that they came to them in crowds and submitted gladly to an authority which they saw promoted their happiness  with such an accession their city soon arose to a considerable degree of strength and convenience for the safety as well as for the necessary purposes of life and the inhabitants encouraged by success applied themselves to every art of industry and genius to advance their general interest  the hills echoed with the voice of their flocks and herds the plains and valleys smiled in the rich livery of harvest while the ships which had served the melancholy purpose of their flight now brought them the most precious merchandises of the east in return for their manufactures and the superfluous produce of their new country  section vii when all things were settled in this prosperous course narbal whose views were too extensive to be confined to the present moment assembled his whole people and laying before them the present flourishing state of their affairs resigned into their hands the authority with which they had entrusted him advising them to establish some permanent form of government which might give a rational hope of securing the continuance of their happiness  but they who had learned wisdom in the school of adversity were not to be tempted by any allurements of power to forego the advantages which they experienced under his care they not only refused to accept his resignation but in the warmth of their gratitude and confidence offered to choose him directly for their king  though this far outwent the intention of narbal he thought proper to accede in appearance to their proposal for the present as the method for accomplishing the great design he had in view but declined actually receiving the crown till he should make some preparations which he esteemed necessary for so solemn a ceremony  the opportunities narbal had had of comparing the various forms of government in all the various countries through which he had traveled having enabled him to discover the defects and advantages in each he directly applied himself with the utmost assiduity and attention to select from all such particular parts as when digested into one consistent system might be most likely to procure the happiness of the community the great end of all government in the purity of its original intention  when he had completed his design he again convened the people on a mount which arose in the midst of the city and having offered up sacrifices and prayers to the gods to be propitious to his undertaking the most venerable of the elders informed them of the cause of their being assembled  an universal burst of joyful acclamation testifying their assent narbal advanced to the altar and waving his hand to demand attention declared with a determined look and accent that as he was come there that day to take upon him the government of the state at their request not by his own desire he expected they would permit him to explain the terms on which alone it was his invariable resolution to enter upon that equally difficult and important charge  a silence still as death following his words he drew forth from his bosom a written roll and read aloud to them a particular account of the form of government which he proposed to establish desiring them to make their objections to the whole or any particular part thereof which they should disapprove as the sanction of their approbation that day was to be for ever after irrevocable  section viii it is not necessary to enter into a minute detail of all the several parts of his system a short sketch of the leading principles of it will sufficiently show its excellence  justly sensible that the prosperity of a state is necessarily derived from and dependent on the favor of heaven he ordained that all the sacred rites of religion should be constantly performed with piety and proper order and to enable the persons set apart for the performance of them to attend to that duty without interruption from the anxieties and avocations of domestic care and give them that respect in the eyes of the people which is indispensibly necessary to add weight and influence to precepts he appointed them a competent support out of the public revenue without laying them under the dangerous necessity of receiving that support from the voluntary contributions of particulars who might either want ability or inclination to give it and therefore would hold the demander in disesteem as a right to enforce such demand by compulsive means the only remedy in such a situation must raise animosities which would prejudice the people against his precepts as well as against himself  the miseries which he had invariably seen the people groan under in those countries where the prince knows no law but his own will and executes that law himself overbalanced every temptation with which power could assail his generous heart and determined him against a form of government where greatness is purchased at so dear a price as on the other hand he had before his eyes in the unhappy fate of his native country a melancholy proof of the evils attending those governments in which the supreme power is lodged solely in the collective body of the people whose councils are too often dictated by caprice or intrigue and whose motions where the object is not instantly present are as slow and feeble as their resolutions are precipitate and rash  between these two extremes the wisdom of narbal chose a mean in which he hoped to avoid the evils incident to both  to give dignity and vigor to the state he ordained that it should be governed by a king as he also ordained that the crown should descend by regular succession in one family to obviate the fatal consequences which attend the struggles of ambition being too well read in the human heart to trust the people with the right of choosing their sovereign on every succession a right inestimable in its first principle where reason directs the choice to merit only but liable to such abuse in the practice as overbalances every advantage  to prevent the abuse of power when thus rendered hereditary and certain he appointed limits to the authority of the crown by laws which ascertained the rights of the people which laws were to be acknowledged by every successive sovereign on his ascending the throne and his observation of them made the condition of the peoples obedience  to assist the sovereign with their advice in the arduous affairs of government he instituted a council composed of the elders and chiefs of the carthaginian families who had been the companions of his flight to whom he joined a few of the natives most eminent for their virtue to obviate any apprehension that their interests might be sacrificed to those of their new fellow subjects  that this council should not be subject to the influences of fear or mercenary motives he appointed them several honorable and important privileges and consigned to each a considerable property out of the public stock which privilege and property were to descend to their posterity who were to be the hereditary counselors of the king and guardians of the laws so long as they persevered in the principles of private as well as public virtue for which they were raised to such honor but on their falling off from them or dissipating the property thus given to secure their independance all those advantages were to be forfeited their families reduced to a private rank and their places filled with persons more worthy of them  lest this preeminence should tempt this hereditary council to infringe upon the authority of the sovereign or join him in oppressing the people above whom they were thus raised narbal instituted a second council inferior in rank to be chosen annually by the people from among themselves to watch over their interests and defeat any attempt which might be made either by the sovereign or the superior council to exceed the limits respectively appointed to them which second council was to be convened at a certain time in every year to examine past transactions and concert future measures during their attendance on which duties they were to enjoy the same privileges as the superior council but at the end of that attendance to return to their former private state and this short duration of their authority was ordained that in case this representative council or any of its members should deviate from the sense of their constituents or betray their confidence the people might have a timely remedy in their power by correcting their choice and entrusting their rights into more faithful hands before any evil or error committed by them should take too deep a root  by these two councils in conjunction with the sovereign were to be framed all future laws for the government of the state as well in its interior policy as in respect to its connections and intercourse with other states which conjunction was so essential that the dissent of the sovereign or either council prevented the establishment of the law proposed and of all laws the execution was committed to the king with a power of appointing persons proper for that purpose but under this restriction that no person should be appointed to execute the laws who was himself known to persist in the violation of any law  and lastly to support the dignity of the crown and defray the necessary expenses of the state he appointed a certain portion of lands to be cultivated by such delinquents as by their crimes should deserve the loss of liberty being sensible of the absurdity and injustice to the public of depriving it of the service of its members by punishing any crime beside murder with the death of the criminal and that as all other crimes proceed ultimately from idleness their proper punishment is labor the apprehension of which accumulated as far as the strength of the criminal could possibly support and continued for his life must be much more effectual to prevent the commission of such crimes than any other punishment however severe but of short duration and till there should be a sufficient number of such delinquents or if happily there never should then by the lower ranks of the people for hire to be paid out of the produce of their labor  to such a system of government it was impossible to make any objection the people unanimously testified their approbation of it in the strongest manner and narbal having sworn at the altar to preserve it inviolably in every respect and instance to the utmost of his power and imprecated the vengeance of heaven upon any of his successors who should attempt to subvert it he received the crown from the hands of the chief priest amid the universal acclamations and blessings of all present who in return swore fidelity to him and obedience to the government which he planned for their mutual benefit concluding the sacred solemnity with oblations and prayers to the gods for their blessing and protection  section ix the same wisdom and public spirit which had dictated this form of government appeared in every act of narbals reign he promoted virtue and punished vice he secured the civil rights and private property of his subjects by plain and equitable laws he established order in the state and regulated its internal policy he restrained ostentatious expense luxury and excess he encouraged industry and application to the useful arts and his own conduct was the best comment on his laws  when he had settled these most immediate objects of his care he extended it to others more remote though not less important  he knew that industry is the true parent of strength and commerce the only inexhaustible fund of wealth to a state but he had learned from the unhappy fate of carthage that even commerce may be pursued too far and that excess of wealth is weakness he therefore directed the spirit of industry to a more solid object  of all the ways in which the combined force of the human mind and body can be exerted the most advantageous and at the same time the most truly honorable is agriculture it creates that wealth which commerce only collects it supports the arts by supporting life for the exercise of them it increases population and provides for that increase in a word as much as the supply of natural is more important than that of artificial wants as much as life itself than the phantastic emoluments of it by so much is agriculture superior to every other art and for this reason the first and great aim of narbals policy through the whole course of his reign was to improve agriculture and promote it by every encouragement of interest and honor  nor was his care confined within the circle of his own kingdom he studied the genius and interests of all the neighboring nations and laid down rules for the conduct proper to be observed in every possible intercourse with them  though the first aim of narbals policy was peace and his first laws calculated for the cultivation of it he was too well acquainted with human nature to expect that such a blessing could be preserved to his people without the support of force to repel the attacks of envy interest and ambition  to establish this force therefore in constant readiness for so necessary a purpose he ordained that all the byrsan youth should learn the warlike arts and appear at certain stated times in every year before him to show their expertness at them encouraging emulation by honorary prizes but at the same time taking every possible precaution to suppress ambition and an indiscriminate passion for war  the wisdom of these institutions soon appeared his people were held in esteem and respect by all the neighboring nations they were happy in themselves and their country flourished in all the blessings of industry and peace and as far as human reason could look forward into time the firmness of the basis upon which his happiness was founded secured its duration  but why do i dwell thus fondly on the excellencies of a government which is now no more the theme must be disinteresting to you but my mind is so filled with the revered idea that in the overflowing of my heart i have insensibly ran into lengths beyond my first design  saying this he wiped away the tears   imitate not his prolixity interrupted temugin by a description of grief as disgusting in your repetition as it was groundless in him as well may it be expected to make the sea stand still as to frame a system of government which will not change every hour produces incidents which alter its form as necessarily as the motion of the air moves the face of the waters but such is the wisdom of speculative legislators proceed   the captive bowed his head in submission to a reproof the force of which he felt and thus resumed his story  section x heaven continued my host rewarded the virtue of narbal in the amplest manner he saw all his pious labors crowned with success and died full of years and full of glory leaving his crown to a son worthy to succeed him  the kingdom of byrsa flourished for many ages under a long succession of princes of the race of narbal who all adhered faithfully to the great principles of his government every change which became necessary in the change of times being regulated by them  but unhappily the same care was not observed perhaps was not possible to be observed in the minuter matters of domestic policy a long course of prosperity made the byrsans forget that their state owed its origin to misfortune and wealth accumulated by frugality was thought to remove the necessity of that virtue  the natural wants of man are few and easily supplied but the artificial are infinite and insatiable not content with the necessaries of life he looks around for the conveniences from which to the luxuries the ascent is insensible  no sooner had the sumptuary laws so strictly enjoined by narbal began to be relaxed than the spirit of commerce consequentially and designedly restrained by them broke through all bounds and ransacked every quarter of the earth to gratify the fantastic demands of luxury and caprice  the opportunities which this opened of bartering from one to another the various products of all the various nations with whom they traded afforded them such gain that as their wealth had made them luxurious so their luxury made them wealthy  the effects of this were soon felt the wealth of individuals exceeded that of the state in every degree of just proportion and their expense exceeded that wealth a false refinement universally took place of that sublime simplicity of sentiment and manners which had been the honorable characteristic of the byrsan nation their buildings were raised more for ostentation than use their garments were fashioned by vanity their food was chosen merely for its expense however disagreeable to the taste or destructive to health respect was measured by riches honors were openly sold or conferred for services in their nature most dishonorable virtue and merit were depressed by contempt and neglect while vice found favor and injudicious mercy encouraged crimes by disarming justice of its terrors  in a word the whole business of life was dissipation and every thing serious every regard to decency moral virtue and religion was turned into ridicule  in order to carry on their commerce to greater advantage the byrsans planted colonies in different parts of the earth which drained their own country of its most useful inhabitants none who were not possessed of considerable wealth or whose professions did not immediately minister to the gratification of luxury finding any encouragement or even being able to live at home where the fascination of example had made a profusion in expense unavoidable and idleness and vanity had so far enhanced the price of the indispensible necessaries of life as to involve the industrious poor whose labor is the natural support as their numbers make the real strength of a state in all the miseries of want and oblige them to seek subsistence elsewhere  time showed the consequence of this conduct these colonies increasing in numbers in proportion to the depopulation of their mother country by such emigrations and flourishing in all the arts carried from thence at length felt their own strength and scorning a dependence no longer supported by sufficient power took the first plausible occasion to shake it off and ever after carried themselves like states allied upon equal terms rather than subjects  nor was the exterior polity of the byrsans ruled by principles of greater wisdom or virtue proud of their wealth they looked with contempt on every poorer nation and blindly mistaking that wealth for strength scrupled not to invade their rights as views of interest or ambition chanced to tempt them  such a conduct often necessarily engaged them in wars with the neighboring nations and gave the sanction of justice to the attacks which envy of their prosperity had before designed against them but as these attacks were always made on some particular occasion and singly by the people then aggrieved they constantly failed of their effect and only increased by such exertion the power they were intended to overturn  in this manner did they proceed for many ages flourishing in a false prosperity the cause of which insensibly undermined its foundation like a tree growing by the side of a river whose waters at the same time that they make its branches spread and cover them with bloom wash away the earth from its roots till it falls unexpectedly in the midst of its glory overturned by the slightest gust of wind and buries every thing near it in its ruins  section xi in the commotions which shook the earth when the arabians under the pretext of propagating their religion impiously ravaged and enslaved the greater part of the world as if the benign father of creation could be pleased with the misery and desolation of his works a body of egyptians who had escaped their fury settled themselves in a mountainous and barren tract of land which lay between the country of the byrsans and the desert over which they had fled with their families in their despair   appalled at this arraignment of the religion in which i had been educated of principles which i had ever been taught to hold most sacred all my respect for my host could not prevent my interrupting him  mercy gracious heaven i exclaimed what do i hear can any duty be more incumbent on man than to propagate the true religion even by force where persuasion fails is not every man who refuses to receive it an enemy to god and as such to be cut off from among men and is it not a most impious breach of that duty a prostitution of benevolence to exert it toward him  beware o my son he replied with a look and accent of the greatest earnestness beware of intruding thyself into the councils of heaven has the supreme being told you that only one religion is acceptable to him and that the religion which you profess is that one if you allege a particular revelation of your religion do not others rest upon a like foundation and does not every man believe his own to be true  in such a contrariety by what virtue have you alone merited the preference of being right or rather how has the place of your birth merited that preference for by that was determined the mode of your religion and would a matter of such importance have been left depending on a circumstance so merely accidental  beside to allow what you contend for that your religion is the only one which is right has the deity delegated to you a power which he has not exerted himself of compelling all men to think alike or if he intends such compulsion does he want your assistance to effect it can not he who creates the mind mould it as he pleases and is it not in vain is it not impious for man to attempt controuling that which the deity has left free  nor is it less so to attempt usurping his vengeance if he would punish are not famine and pestilence as swords in his hand does not the thunder roar do not the foundations of the earth tremble at his word universal benevolence is the sacrifice most acceptable to heaven nor can any religion be derived from thence which would enjoin a breach of that invariable eternal duty  then observing that i was ready to burst with indignation and eagerness to controvert what he said repress your zeal my son he continued softening his voice and regarding me with a look of inexpressible tenderness and examine dispassionately before you presume to judge influenced by the same motives i once thought as you do now and held in detestation every religion but my own or rather that of the country in which i had happened to be born which i had received implicitly without examination or proof but reason and experience have since opened my eyes to my error  if only one manner of worship could be acceptable to the deity would he not have made that manner known to all mankind at their creation would he not have made the mind conceive it as invariably as he made the senses represent their objects would he not have made it as selfevident as the foundation of moral virtue which is received without variation by all mankind probably do as you would be done by   if eternal unhappiness was to be the necessary consequence of differing from this manner would it have been consistent either with his goodness or his justice to have left by so much the greater part of mankind ignorant of it this would have been to create them on purpose for unhappiness an imputation which is the greatest offense possible for man to offer to god so far as respects himself only  consider that the mode of worship which prevails most in the world is not known to the hundredth perhaps not to the thousandth part of its inhabitants  consider also how many ages have passed away before any of the present modes were known at all and then you will see the impious absurdity of excluding from mercy all but the few professors of a particular one among them  who then shall dare to call the man who professes a different mode of worship an enemy to heaven and how can it be a duty to attempt propagating by force an uniformity which is not prescribed should he not rather conclude from its not having been prescribed that the variety is pleasing in the same manner as the beauty of sensible objects arises from variation in their parts wherever i hear the praises of the deity sung my soul shall accompany them without objecting to the manner nor will i hazard the profanation of so sacred a duty by arrogantly attempting to obtrude any other  to prove the necessary obligation of mutual benevolence man was created in a state of indispensible dependence upon the assistance of others from the first moment of his life shall he not then give that assistance which he has received and must continue to receive have all who have administered relief to his wants professed the same religion with him and would their professing another make their assistance ineffectual to his relief be the religion of a man what it will while the morsel of bread which i receive from his hand yields me wholesome nourishment never will i think myself absolved from much less interdicted the duty of administering relief to his wants nothing less than an immediate interposition of the deity by a total change of natural effects being sufficient to abrogate a law made necessary by him to my nature  in a word my son the worship truly acceptable to the deity is the immediate act of the soul and consists in gratitude for his blessings and resignation to his will while i pay that with sincerity of heart i fear not his taking offense at the posture of my body or any other   cease interrupted temugin nor waste time in repeating the proofs of principles selfevident some mode of worship is necessary and since no particular one has been universally established by that power which alone has the right every country is entitled to pursue its own and every individual obliged to observe it in his actions which only are subject to human authority  section xii the byrsans resumed the captive who at the time of the arrival of those strangers were beginning to deviate from the sage institutions of narbal and turn all their attention from agriculture to commerce gave no obstruction to this new settlement either not thinking those mountains worth cultivating or perhaps not being yet so intoxicated by good fortune as to forget the origin of their own state  for several ages there subsisted but little intercourse between the byrsans and their new neighbors who had assumed the name of coptes the byrsans in the pride of prosperity disdaining to take notice of a people struggling with distress and the coptes in the sullen diffidence of that distress keeping at an equal distance from such unfeeling neighbors  while the byrsans therefore were extending their commerce to the extremities of the earth and revelling in the luxuries which it produced the coptes precluded by their situation from every foreign intercourse applied themselves entirely to agriculture in which the natural disadvantages of their country obliged them to exert all their industry in order to procure the indispensible necessaries of life  but these disadvantages were more than made amends for by the consequences they secured them from the pernicious effects of luxury and all the train of vices and evils which attend on wealth if they possessed but little they wanted still less they were strong in body and resolute of spirit and their habitations were filled with a numerous and healthful progeny  in the course of time such unremitted industry changed the face of the country and remedied all the unkindnesses of nature the hills were covered with flocks and herds the song of the husbandman echoed in the valleys and the voice of plenty and content was heard through all the land  such a change at length raised the envy and avarice of the byrsans who were then in the zenith of their glory they sent haughtily to the coptes to demand possession of their country which they alleged to belong to themselves and without even waiting for an answer prepared to march a powerful army to seize by force that which they were conscious they had no right to receive peaceably  the coptes naturally were surprised at such a demand and directly sent an embassy of the most respectable persons in their state to show the injustice of it they alleged the length of the time during which they had been in undisturbed possession of the country which their ancestors had found desolate and unpossessed by any inhabitants that the byrsans far from claiming any right to it at that time as they certainly would have done had they thought it belonged to them took not the least notice much less offense at their settling there nor had ever mentioned such a claim in any of the transactions which had occasionally passed between the two nations since and finally that the title of the coptes to the country which they inhabited was equally good with that of the byrsans to theirs both people having been compelled by necessity to fly from their native homes and fix themselves in the same manner wherever they could find a place of refuge  unanswerable as these arguments were they had no force with the byrsans who scarcely deigned to wait till the king should give the ambassadors an audience  at this unhappy period commences the sad story of my misfortunes which were so immediately derived from those of my country that i thought it necessary to give this short detail as an introduction to the events of my own life  the entrance of an eunuch to acquaint temugin with the arrival of an express from the general of one of his armies interrupted the captive at this place he was commanded to withdraw and wait the emperors pleasure to hear the continuation of his narrative at some other time  end of the second book the history of arsaces prince of betlis book the third section i the curiosity of temugin who had heard something of the destruction of the byrsan state and was desirous to be better informed of it was so highly interested by the captives story that he ordered his attendance the next evening when he resumed it as follows  an illustrious ancestry continued himilco so was my venerable host called is the deepest disgrace to a degenerate offspring but where it excites virtuous emulation it reflects additional luster upon every new access of honor sealing it with the sanction of inheritance and may be mentioned without incurring the reproach of vanity  the house of my father derived its origin from narbal by his youngest son mago whose descendants always justified by their merits the claim which their blood gave them to the first offices in the state  my father who beheld with grief every deviation from the wise institutions of his royal progenitor took particular care to instruct me in the true sense and spirit of them from a fond hope that heaven would one day offer some favorable opportunity for restoring the government to the purity and vigor of its first principles as he well foresaw from its present relaxation that some great change must necessarily be near but happy for him he lived not to see the accomplishment of his presage  to prove the excellency of these institutions by comparison with those of other nations and to avoid the dangerous influence of such an example as the manners of the byrsan youth then exhibited upon an unexperienced mind my father resolved that i should travel into foreign lands as soon as reason was ripened to sufficient strength to form a proper judgment upon a personal knowledge of the ways of man  having prepared all things for this purpose he led me into his garden on the evening preceding the day appointed for my departure and seating me beside him on the margin of a fountain addressed himself to me in these words words indelibly written on the tablet of my heart  i see with delight said he my son the impression which the precepts of my care have made upon thy mind and i fear not but heaven will enable thee to carry them into execution  to facilitate this great end i send thee to search for wisdom in the world to read the heart of man in his actions and from them learn to distinguish between the appearance and reality of things  were i to consult the tender impulse of nature i should keep thee still in my bosom but i prefer thy advantage to my own pleasure should i not rather say that thy advantage is my greatest pleasure and i part with thee for a time in assured hope of thy returning enriched with wisdom and virtue to support the feeble steps of my old age down the hill of life and crown my urn with the sacred honor of having begotten a son worthy to serve his country  when i say that my hope of thy happy return is assured i would not be understood to mean that there are no dangers in thy way the floating sands of the desert the rage of the tempest or the hidden rocks in the sea are less dangerous than the allurements vice lays in the way of the traveller allurements which it requires the immediate guidance of heaven to avoid they offer themselves in such various shapes and so speciously simulate the very virtues which they counteract  i will not burden thy mind with a repetition of the advice which it has been the pleasing task of my life to instill into it the few following hints as they relate immediately to the scene on which you are just entering are all i shall say at present and then commit thy steps to that guidance which is never withheld from virtue if sought with humble and ardent supplication  open thine eyes and thine ears but bar the door of thy lips ask no questions enter not into arguments concern not yourself in the affairs of others nor reveal your own where the importance of the occasion does not make such a confidence indispensible  silence is universally esteemed to be the consequence of wisdom it therefore engages confidence and commands respect  if you meet any thing which you do not directly comprehend conclude that the difficulty arises from your own inattention and consider the matter again with better care one doubt thus solved by yourself will open your mind more by exercising its powers than the solution of many by another  as for arguing instead of elucidating difficulties it only creates animosity and confirms error the pride of man making him more anxious to support his own opinion than to investigate truth and this was the reason of that mysterious silence enjoined to his pupils by one of the wisest of the western sages  this my son is the sum of what i have to recommend to your attention careful observation of these few plain rules will conduct you safely through the multitudes whom you must mix with to acquire knowledge  saying this he laid his hand upon my head and praying to heaven to confirm the blessings which he heaped upon me dismissed me with a kiss of peace and paternal love  section ii i will not lead you through every weary step i measured nor recount common incidents however interesting to myself at the time such recitals though flattering to that consequence in which man is too apt to hold himself only tire and disgu the hearer  having passed through several regions in all of which under appearances and by means utterly contradictory to each other i saw the same end of present gratification universally pursued with the most anxious and insatiable eagerness i arrived at length upon the banks of the great river euphrates whither i was drawn by an irresistible desire to receive instruction from the mouth of the sage myrza the fame of whose wisdom and sanctity had gone forth into all the nations of the east  the sun was just disappearing as i approached the habitation of the sage it was a grotto formed by the hand of nature at the foot of an hill whose brow hung over the river he sat in the entrance contemplating the smiles of nature in that placid hour and accompanying in his heart the voice of gratitude and gladness which echoed the adoration of every living thing around  he no sooner perceived my approach than he advanced to meet me preventing by a friendly embrace those professions of reverence which his appearance commanded equally with his fame  though report proclaimed him to have measured more than twice the usual life of man and knowledge was written in characters of deepest reflection in his face his eye had not lost the penetrating fire nor his limbs the strength of youth he was crowned with all the honors but exempt from the infirmities of age  having kindly enquired the motive of my coming he led me to his habitation at the entrance of which he resumed his seat placing me beside him while my slaves pitched their tents among some lofty trees at a little distance on the bank of the river then observing that i had not yet overcome the awe with which his presence had struck me knowledge my son said he with a smile of the most encouraging complacency is a gift bestowed with a sparing hand and to but very few the utmost abilities of man reaching little farther than to discover his own ignorance the ambition of it however is most laudable and when properly pursued seldom fails of a just reward in the more valuable acquisition of wisdom  if the observations of my life can conduce to your acquiring either i shall be happy in the communication of them at present the departing sun reminds us of the debt we owe for the blessings of the finished day  saying this he turned his face to the west and falling upon his knees poured forth his evening song of adoration and praise in such exalted strains as rapt my soul in ecstasy i had never felt before while i joined instinctively with him  having performed this sacred duty he arose and turning to me his eyes still sparkling with rapture which seemed to raise him above man my son said he the subject of thy enquiries is too extensive too complex to be discussed in a short time the evening closes apace and nature requires rest tomorrow i will meet thee with the young day in yonder citron grove and give thee every information in my power  section iii soon as the angel of the morning had chased away the spirits of darkness from the face of the earth i repaired to the grove where i waited not long before i was joined by the sage  after some expressions of benevolence and regard he led me to a bower woven by his own hands and looking at the various birds which winged their way around how different my son said he are the beauties of this scene from those which gild the view of evening satisfied with the enjoyments of the day the feathered race then seek their homes and sing themselves to sleep now busy care awakening with the sun sends them abroad again to seek the same enjoyments secure of finding what they want because their wants are only those of nature who has provided amply for all her offspring  so happily would the circle of mans day wind up were his desires limited within the same bounds i speak of the desires of reason as well as sense for reason and nature never differ a wish for something more would not prevent his enjoyment nor disappointment break his rest then would he not complain that the way to knowledge is without end that every new acquisition only opens a new want but justly grateful for the portion dispensed to him reduce it into practice instead of wasting his days in endless search for more  surely i returned o my father the way to knowledge cannot be without end to him who sets out early and is so happy as to have an instructor capable of directing his steps  instruction he replied is to the mind what food is to the body as in this repletion counteracts nourishment so objects presented to the mind too suddenly or in too rapid a succession by instruction without allowing time to arrange them in due order investigate their properties and prove their agreement by comparison instead of informing only burden reason and bring not knowledge but confusion  wretch that i am i exclaimed surprised and alarmed at what he said have i then only wasted my youth in listening to instruction are the precepts of my father no more than a burden to my mind  i mean not so answered the sage instruction is of the greatest advantage to a youthful mind it awakens its powers improves their strength by exercise and points out the proper objects of their exertion  the precepts of thy father have laid a foundation for knowledge to raise the superstructure must be your own task that which is derived only from precept being no more than a shadow which vanishes on attempting to apply it to use  mustapha eber ibrahim was born in the city of bagdat where he gained such reputation in his trade of a jeweller that he soon became rich  encouraged by this success he resolved to breed up his two sons kerker and hassan to the same trade and that in such a manner as he flattered himself would enable them to rise to greater eminence in it than had ever been attained by any former artist  mustapha was himself utterly unlearned practice had taught him to know the value of the gems and metals in which he wrought and to fashion and arrange them in such forms and combinations as should display their colors and employ their properties to most advantage but all his knowledge ended there when he was asked the cause of these properties and why such forms and arrangements produced those effects he was unable to give an answer satisfactory even to himself much less to the enquirer  the pride of wealth being hurt by consciousness of this ignorance he determined to save his sons from such disgrace by giving them a liberal education before he should begin to teach them his art  for this purpose he procured them the most celebrated masters in all the several branches of philosophy who executed their charge with the greatest fidelity though not with equal success to their pupils the turn and powers of whose minds were totally different from each other  kerker the elder was lively in the extreme degree his imagination outran the precepts of his instructor without waiting to examine farther than the first glance he catched at the conclusion before they could adduce half the proofs and his tongue never wanted the happiest words to express his conceptions  hassan on the contrary was given to doubt he paid no respect to authority nor would admit any thing without the clearest proof in examining which he was so cautious and slow that he wore out the patience of instructors who hesitated not to pronounce him incapable of learning and therefore counseled his father to apply him wholly to his trade  while kerker consequently was indulging himself in ranging through the boundless regions of theory and reasoning upon causes and effects according to the various systems of the philosophy he had studied hassan was obliged to confine his thoughts to his labor and to rest satisfied with that small pittance of knowledge which he could elicit from experience  though mustapha felt this disappointment of his hopes in his younger son with the fondness of a father he found consolation in the rapid progress made by the elder and his heart exulted when he heard him display his learning to the crowds whom his fame collected round him  but this exultation lasted not long the knowledge of kerker was merely speculative and by misapplication defeated the end it was designed to obtain confiding in it he had disdained to apply himself to the gradual practice of an art with the principles of which he was so well acquainted and thinking he could execute whatever he thought he understood he affected to mount at once to that eminence of skill which can be attained only by long and careful application  he could explain the nature of precious stones and account for the different degrees of their perfection but when they were placed before him he was unable to distinguish those degrees and often bought the worst instead of the best he could describe the effects produced by the various combinations of their colors but he knew not how to combine them so as to produce the effects he described  the consequence naturally was that his knowledge was turned into ridicule he lost his business and wasted the wealth earned by his father in so much that he would have wanted a morsel of bread in his old age had he not found a resource in his younger son who thinking for himself while the elder read the opinions of others and laboring while he talked had drawn real knowledge from its true source experience and arrived regularly at the end which his brother had missed by mistaking the effect for the cause and beginning where he should have ended  surely my father said i observing that myrza paused at these words to leave the application to myself the moral of this tale cannot have reference to my case to think of arriving at excellence in manual arts by speculative instruction without a regular gradation of practice were most absurd but may i not dare to doubt if science is within the same rule is there not for instance an essential difference between polity and mechanism between knowledge of the interests of nations and of the value of precious stones  the difference between science and art replied the sage so far as they have reference to the uses of life and to consider them farther were foreign to the present purpose is confined to their objects and extends not to their manner of operation  even in science merely speculative which terminates in itself the mind proceeds by as regular a gradation as the hand in works of art but because the steps of this gradation are not so immediately seen the vanity of man overlooks it and attempts to rise to the summit at a single bound and hence proceed most of the errors which defeat his designs  instruction teaches the mind the use of its own powers and points out the directest path to knowledge but there its purpose ends to acquire that knowledge the mind must prove the truth of precept by practice a speculative jeweller is not liable to commit greater errors in his profession than is a speculative king  can it be thought less difficult to discover the different characters and apply their abilities properly which is the perfection of the art of governing or polity than to know the value of jewels and combine their colors why is not government arrived at greater perfection and the interests of nations more improved is it that they will not admit of more improvement and that the nature of man cannot be better governed by no means the fault is in the agent not the subject the errors of a prince lifted from the cradle or seraglio to the throne of a vizier chosen merely from favor undo in one hour the work of an age and require the wisdom of another to bring things back to their first state and this it is which has prevented polity from arriving at greater perfection  section iv you have shown me o son of wisdom said i the error in which i have set out show me also how to correct it  the wisdom of thy father returned the sage has sent thee forth into the world with a mind well prepared by instruction to draw from experience that practical knowledge which is necessary to conduct thee safely through life and enable thee to fulfill the duties of it but his fondness has thrown obstacles in thy way which if not timely removed may disappoint his hopes  surrounded thus by a crowd of slaves you see only with their eyes and while they minister to unnecessary convenience they debar you from that intercourse with other people by which alone experience in their ways is to be acquired and not by running from place to place viewing superficially the face of nature the works of art and studied manners  before the wealthy all men wear a mask his equals in wealth disguise their sentiments under an appearance of politeness and show only the bright side of their country from emulative pride the poor run into the opposite extreme vilifying their country to flatter him by the comparison and throw the blame of their misery from themselves in order to excite his compassion and draw relief from his bounty  to see the world properly you must enter into it you must dismiss your long train of attendants lay aside your purple robes and mix with the multitude without any mark of distinction to put them on their guard thus only can you learn their real sentiments and trace the motives of their actions  but is there no danger in doing this i returned hurt at an injunction so humiliating to the pride of condition so contrary to the course of life in which i had been brought up is not a traveller subject to many accidents and disasters which require care and assistance are there not menial offices which a man cannot so well perform for himself   and who performs them for thy slave replied the sage who spreads a carpet for the pilgrim in the wilderness or guards the mariner from the dangers of the sea  but this is the vanity of man is thy nature superior to theirs and is not the distinction between you merely accidental man wants not assistance to perform for himself the very few offices which are really necessary for him nor is one state of life exposed to greater dangers than another be superior to this vain weakness the power which protects and provides for every living thing will not neglect you while you deserve his care  the force of truth is irresistible i was humbled in my own eyes and hung down my head abashed before him after a pause of a few moments i threw myself at his feet and embracing his knees i see i acknowledge my error said i and will correct it i will go directly to bagdat and there sell all those slaves of whose attendance thou have shown me the evil happy if by this obedience i may appear not unworthy of thy farther instruction to implore which i will return to you  and why should thou sell them he returned raising me tenderly from the ground why not restore them to that liberty which is the common right of all mankind though so many are unjustly deprived of it that grown familiar and in a manner sanctified by use the injustice has almost lost its native appearance and passes for a right   are then all men equal said i amazed at what i heard and have all a right to the same stations in life  that all are equal in their nature he replied reason will infallibly show you as it will also show that they have an equal right to the same stations if they can arrive at them by just means but as there is a subordination indispensibly necessary for the purposes of life so all must remain in those stages of the ascent which have fallen to their first lot till they rise to higher by their own merit and this instead of being an unjust partiality in the economy of nature is the best incentive and reward of virtuous emulation  his words instantly dispelled the clouds of prejudice in which my mind was involved opening my heart with delight to sentiments which vindicated human nature from such indignity i set all my slaves at liberty and was proceeding to divide among them the wealth which my father had given me to defray the expenses of my journey but myrza restrained me  hold said he prudence is a virtue equally with generosity and a man may be unjust to himself no less than to another give them the means of supporting life by honest industry or the gift of liberty will be of little value to them but make not yourself poor to make them unnecessarily rich  i perceive that the greatest part of the wealth given to you by your father consists in precious stones reserve these for yourself they are light of carriage and may be easily concealed poverty is subject to many inconveniences and riches are a blessing when rightly used the time may come when yours may be necessary to you if only to relieve the necessities of others for your slaves the equipage and implements of luxury and the utensils of their own servitude for which you can have no farther use when you dismiss themselves will be sufficient if they apply them properly if not they will be too much  nor would i counsel you to dismiss all your attendants indiscriminately and launch into the world absolutely alone you are yet too inexperienced in its ways for such an adventurous enterprise is there not among them some one whom your father has particularly recommended to your confidence i have observed one whose looks bespeak an heart honest in itself and affectionate to you and whose years promise experience you have given him his liberty in return for which he will give you his friendship and be the faithful companion of your travels so shall you avoid the discomfort of journeying alone and enjoy in his conversation a pleasure more sublime than you could possibly receive from the attendance of a slave  these cares consuming the rest of the day i remained that night the guest of myrsa who after we had closed the evening in the same manner as the preceding lodged me in one of the recesses of his grottoe  it is impossible to express what i felt on this occasion my heart at first revolted against a change in my situation by which i fancied myself dishonored but a moments reflection restored me to reason and the thought of having made my servants free and happy compensated well for the want of their service  section v i would have departed the next morning but myrza insisted on my tarrying with him for a few days every hour of which added to my knowledge as he always turned his conversation to the subjects most instructive and encouraged me to declare every doubt which opposed my assenting to his words  the wisdom which he showed in solving these doubts and his sagacity in frequently anticipating my declaration of them as if he saw into my very soul confirmed me so strongly in the opinion propagated by fame of his holding converse with the spiritual beings who watch over the actions of man that i could not forbear taking occasion one evening as we sat on the bank of the river discoursing on various subjects to ask him how it might be possible to obtain the happiness of an intercourse with them  that there are spiritual beings my son said he after a pause of some minutes as if to consider so difficult a subject which inhabit the several elements of which this world is composed as well as the earth is inhabited by man is an opinion founded on such testimony of the fact and which has so universally prevailed in every age and country that it were offering an affront to the human mind to suppose it utterly without foundation  nor does its credit depend solely on this invariable consent reason receives it with reverence as one of those sublime probabilities which though above its power to prove yet contradict none of those tests on which it rests the proof of matters incapable of direct demonstration  the infinite variety of animated beings which we behold cover the face of the earth so as not to leave one atom of it uninhabited gives cause to conclude that the other elements are peopled also as fully by beings to whose organs of life they are adapted though imperceptible to the grosser senses of man as else there would be a void an useless part in the works of the deity a supposition contradicting the sacred and selfevident truth that he does nothing in vain  but though reason can thus rest itself satisfied in the existence of such beings its researches into their nature and occupation meet not with equal success whether they are immortal and were all created at the same time or if not in what manner the species is continued and whether they are immaterial or only composed of matter more subtle than the objects of human sense being questions in the pathless illimitable contemplation of which the mind wanders at a loss for any certain point whereon to rest belief  as to their occupation the same universal opinion which agrees in their existence agrees also in assigning to them the conduct of mans actions which are supposed to be good or bad according to the nature of the spirit which directs them but this opinion beside that it is unsupported by other proof like the former is attended with great difficulties and must for many reasons be received with great and most cautious limitations  if the actions of man are entirely directed by such beings what becomes of his freeagency on which alone can depend the merit or demerit of those actions and are not those beings justly chargeable with them not he  but this difficulty and many others attending this opinion which are so evident that it is unnecessary to repeat them will vanish if instead of assigning to those beings the direction of mans actions we suppose them employed in his protection from the many dangers incident to his nature and in which his passions every moment entangle him an occupation by its benevolence better suited to a being of a superior nature  section vi in respect to what you mentioned of an intercourse between man and these beings that also is a question attended with many difficulties and to be most cautiously received  how i exclaimed astonished and disappointed at what i heard is not the testimony of so many wise and holy men who assert their having both seen and heard them a sufficient proof of this intercourse   i deny not the reality of the intercourse replied the sage i only am in doubt concerning the manner of it whether perceptibly to the senses or only in the power of imagination  if they are immaterial how can they have a form to be seen how can they emit a voice to be heard if they are material how can they appear instantly close to a man without any appearance of gradual approach how can they melt into air and disappear totally in an instant without gradual departure and is it not more consonant to reason to suppose that being mind themselves they hold intercourse only with the mind and are reflected upon the senses by the power of imagination in the same manner as objects in a dream a supposition on which that testimony may possibly be found to depend chiefly for credit so many absurdities and contradictions being supported by it equally with the most important truths that without this method of accounting for the deception of the testifier the mind would reject the latter because of the former  not that this supposition is unattended with difficulties either such a manner of conversing is certainly above our comprehension but then it contradicts not reason and if we refuse assent to every thing which we cannot clearly comprehend our knowledge will be reduced within very narrow limits i know that my hand moves in obedience to my will but i know not how my will operates upon my hand to effect that motion we deceive ourselves with vain words our boasted knowledge extends only to facts but the manner in which these are effected is hidden from us  but does not the admission of this possibility of deception i returned at the same time weaken if not overturn all historic faith which depends entirely upon testimony  not in the least replied the sage testimony is certainly sufficient proof of facts which run in the regular course of nature but where this is deviated from too much caution can not be taken in examining the end of that deviation and the competency of the testimony by which it is supported  when you tell me that the city of byrsa was founded by narbal on the destruction of carthage by the romans i hesitate not a moment to give credit to your words because people who lived at the time and therefore may be justly supposed to have been acquainted with the fact have left written memorials which have been handed down regularly from them to us that there was such a city as carthage and that it was destroyed by a people called romans  because there is nothing out of the common course of things in such a destruction or in a princes flying from the conquerors with a number of the citizens and founding a state in another country and because you have sufficient ability and may have had sufficient opportunity to trace the state in which you were born to its origin and can have no sufficient reason to attempt imposing a falsehood upon my credulity  but should you tell me that the flight of narbal was in consequence of a spirits having appeared to him and commanded him to leave his own country and go to that where he founded his state i might receive the relation with respect because of the virtue of the relator and the importance of the end proposed by such appearance but not without a doubt when i balance against his testimony the possibility of its being only in the power of imagination and the irregularity of the fact in the common course of nature and also because it may have been feigned by him to promote an expedition on which he was intent and doubted the sufficiency of his own influence to carry into execution without the assistance of such an authority  but should you add that on his arrival at that place the stones and trees instantly formed themselves into a city for the reception of his people to save them the delay and labor of building i should directly reject the whole as a fiction devised since his time for the purpose of imposition  nor is there any danger of this principles breaking the vigor of the mind by inducing a general doubt if it s not applied beyond its proper limits  credulity and skepticism are the extremities of a line in the middle of which true knowledge is placed  by believing indiscriminately the mind lies open to receive the grossest and most dangerous errors by indiscriminate doubt to reject the most important truths to find the mean between these is the business of reason which it seldom fails in when permitted to seek for it without prejudice  i have said that if we deny every thing which we do not clearly comprehend our knowledge will be reduced within very narrow bounds perhaps these bounds are already narrower than we are well aware  i know that i exist because i perceive the operations of my mind i know that i derive not my existence from myself because i know not how i came to exist i therefore know that another being from whom i derive my existence must also exist and i know that this being must exist necessarily without deriving existence from any other because an endless succession is impossible and lastly i know that as all other beings derive their existence from this being so they can exist only by him and therefore that it is their duty to obey those laws which he has thought proper to prescribe to them but farther than this i know nothing  and with this portion of knowledge i am humbly and gratefully content not will i misapply the gift by attempting to pry farther satisfied that little as it may appear it is amply sufficient to conduct me in safety through the dangers of this life to the happiness of the next  though the pleasure i found in the conversation of myrza increased every hour with the increase of knowledge which i derived from it i forgot not myself so far as to engross too much of that time which should be a common benefit to all mankind at the end of fifteen days i departed from him and committing myself with humble resignation to the guidance of heaven resumed my travels in company with the friend whom he had selected for me  section vii the sun had but just began to gild the firmament with the first beams of day when i left the grottoe of myrza the sound of his voice was still in my ears i exulted in the proficiency i had made under his instructions and thought myself superior to every incident of life  but i had not proceeded far before this confidence began to cool i soon felt the fatigue of traveling in a manner to which i was unaccustomed and the thought of my being alone for with a single companion i esteemed myself little better awoke sensations in no respect pleasing i started in affright and blushed at my own weakness i reasoned against it but it eluded my reasons at length i compounded the contest i resolved to continue my journey to bagdat and if i should find the inconveniences overbalance the advantage to provide new attendants there  but my fellow traveller and friend saved me from such a weakness he perceived my uneasiness and was alarmed for my health by limiting his enquiries to which he persuaded me that he had not discovered my disorder to be in my mind and rouzed the spirit of pride to conceal my shame  this employed my thoughts till the cause of my uneasiness became familiar to me when it totally vanished and i only wondered that i had been uneasy  on the third day of our journey we joined a numerous caravan of merchants who had pitched their tents on the bank of the river to avoid the heat of the sun which had now mounted high in the heavens  the habits of faquirs which we had assumed by the advice of myrza gained us immediate admission into their company where i was instantly struck with the openness of their behavior which seemed to flow directly from nature without design or reserve  this was entirely new to me i revere thy wisdom sage myrza said i to myself i now see life in its genuine colors how happy am i at being freed from the crowd of attendance who have hitherto stood between me and mankind  but this happiness did not continue long unclouded they were going to eat and desired me to taste a morsel of bread with them i sat down accordingly but started to see a slave seat himself next to me and my heart revolted at my being obliged to fetch water from the river for myself to drink  a very little use however reconciled me also to this debasement as i at first thought it better than all the instructions of myrza had been able to do and convinced me of the vanity of that wisdom which is acquired only by instruction  on being informed that the caravan journied to bagdat i desired permission to continue with them which was readily granted to me and i resolved to begin the practice of myrzas precepts i accordingly observed with the strictest attention every thing i saw and heard and the doubts of one day were generally solved by the next without my asking any solution of them  this conduct soon gained me the respect and confidence of the whole company i was esteemed wise because i betrayed not my ignorance by asking information and every one was eager to communicate his secrets to me because i never enquired into them there being nothing which so effectually counteracts curiosity as the discovery of it  the scenes which this confidence opened to me would have amply overpayed my silence had it been never so contrary to my temper i now saw things in colors the most different from those in which they had appeared to me at my first joining the caravan and found that the same passions rule the human heart in every state of life even the coarse jest the loud laugh of merriment those reputed characteristics of vulgar happiness i could too often trace to motives the most unhappy and see them joined in and enjoyed only in proportion to the malignancy of the allusion  this general confidence though was not unattended by its inconveniences every one who told me his secrets taking my silence for approbation expected that i should enter into his views and was continually obtruding upon me his schemes for their accomplishment in which he thought himself entitled to my assistance so far as to look upon my holding the common intercourse of humanity with his adversary as an act of treachery to him a situation too embarrassing to have been long supported  one evening as i was ruminating upon these inconsistencies and considering how i should disentangle myself from the consequences of them one of the principal merchants in the caravan accosting me in a friendly manner  hassan said he for i had changed my own name of himilco for this to avoid being traced by any of my late attendants i have observed your demeanor ever since you have come among us and see that your wisdom exceeds your age i have therefore resolved to make a proposal to you which will give you the strongest proof of my esteem  you have been informed that this caravan journies to bagdat it is not my intention to accompany it so far i shall turn off tomorrow evening to the country of farsistan whither some matters of importance call me after i shall have executed which i propose continuing my travels through that once flourishing country to the regions whose happy people are first blessed with the sight of the sun on his emerging from the ocean to enlighten the world  from your habit i judge that the motive of your traveling is to acquire knowledge if so this is the path which leads directly to it the sages of antiquity never thought their thirst for wisdom satisfied till they came and drank at this fountain head  if you choose to accompany me in this journey we will drink out of the same cup as brothers my people are sufficient in numbers to defend us from the dangers of the way and the profit which i shall gain by my merchandise will enable me to make provision for the wants of both our future lives i shall not attempt to influence your compliance by any arguments of persuasion you best know the motives which ought to direct your conduct and will be guided by them  it is impossible to express the emotions which i felt at this proposal i had long had the strongest desire to see the countries whither he was going but then the length of the way must detain me much beyond the time prescribed by my father for my return  the difficulty was most distressing but after revolving various schemes i at length thought of one which appeared to reconcile my duty to my inclination i resolved to send back my companion to my father in order to inform him of my intended journey and obviate his apprehensions at my protracted absence  the merchant approving of this design i proceeded immediately to put it in execution the parting between my friend and me was most tender gratitude for the restitution of his liberty had exalted his attachment to me into the warmest affection he embraced my knees he besought me with many tears to let him accompany me in my long and perilous journey and send some other in his place  who will serve you in the day who will watch over you in the night said he wringing his hands in anguish of soul you are not sufficiently inured to hardship your years are too few your strength is unequal to the fatigues into which you are plunging should sickness or disaster befall you who is to administer relief   that power i answered in the words of myrza whose goodness is the support of all his works or human care and relief would be in vain a support in which the piety of my father will think me safe not that i am insensible to your affection i would gladly send another but you know it is not in my power of all whom i might have sent you only remain with me nor would my father give the same credit to the words of any as he will to yours   he saw that it was in vain to urge me farther and would not distress me with fruitless solicitation  my mind was so full of the gratification i promised to my curiosity in this journey that i never attended to the circumstances in which i undertook it circumstances in reality much more terrifying than those which had lately struck me with so many terrors i then had an experienced a careful and an affectionate friend with me i had now implicitly entrusted myself to the faith of people who were in a great measure strangers to me but it was too late to look back  section viii on our entering the empire of farsistan i was struck with horror to behold the desolation and havoc which deformed the face of a country made so beautiful by the hand of nature the lands were uncultivated the cities lay in ruins and the few wretched people destitute of every comfort and almost of every necessary of life wandered from place to place to seek the precarious subsistence of the day  but this universal misery affected me not more than the advantage taken of it by the merchant who exacted the higher prices for his commodities the greater he saw necessity for them aggravating public calamities by turning them to private gain  nor was my abhorrence of such sordid inhumanity greater than my surprise when i compared it with his conduct on other occasions for though the habit of taking advantage in his dealing had gained so strong possession of his heart that he could not refrain from it on any consideration of circumstances in every other instance he was generous and humane and would readily bestow upon the same person of whose necessities he had taken such cruel advantage more than he had exacted from him as should he come the next moment to purchase any thing else he could not avoid repeating his exaction of the very money which he had just before given him in charity and would give him again if requested from the same motive  our journey through the territories of farsistan afforded no incident worthy of relation the country continued to exhibit one scene of desolation more painful to the view than the barren desert the traces of former prosperity aggravating the contemplation of present misery  my fellow traveller saw what i felt and endeavored to divert my thoughts to more pleasing objects when we shall have passed the great river of indus said he the sight of that country will amply compensate for these disagreeable scenes industry there flourishes in the smiles of freedom commerce is encouraged in all its various branches an universal plenty covers the land and the people are numerous healthy and happy  nor less so were the people of this country once till ambition overturned the works of art and marred the blessings of nature the magnificence of the ruins which still remain sufficiently prove its former happiness but among slaves nothing can flourish heaven that a lust of rule should tempt a man to make his own species miserable  cease interrupted temugin nor waste time in repeating the words of a fool the monuments of magnificence which he instanced as proofs of the freedom and happiness of a people prove only their slavery were they not the works of compulsion raised merely to gratify the vanity of the rulers without regard to the miseries of the people employed in raising them to whom they could be of no advantage men who are free labor only for themselves for their own respective use and convenience nor are such monuments of tyrannic ostentation ever raised among them but such are the dreams of idle speculation proceed  section ix the appearance of the country after we had passed the great rivers resumed the captive supported not the representations of the merchant he started and looking around him with astonishment and grief whence can this proceed he exclaimed this melancholy change an hundred moons are scarce elapsed since i was here last all things then wore a different aspect the wrath of heaven must have fallen in famine or pestilence upon the land  while he was preparing to exhibit his merchandise for traffic in the first city at which we arrived i walked forth as was my custom to view the place and observe the manners of the people but what was my surprise at my return to the caravansera in the evening not to find any trace of him  the admonition of my father that moment recurred to my mind i resolved to wait for information from accident without making any enquiries for fear of involving myself in whatever misfortune had happened to him  accordingly i seated myself among other strangers in the gate where my habit of a faquir attracting the notice of a bramin who was passing by he kindly invited me to taste a morsel of food and sleep under his roof that night  when we had finished our repast the composure in which you sat said the bramin persuades me that you were unacquainted with what had happened in that caravansera but a few hours before  a respectable merchant who had trafficked in this unhappy country for many years without committing injustice or suffering injury being a stranger to the tyranny under which we groan at present had no sooner begun to expose his commodities to sale this morning as usual than he was seized by a set of rapacious intruders who abusing the false policy by which they were at first admitted into our country have fastened themselves upon us and now prey upon our vitals  in vain did the honest man desire to know the reason of such an outrage in vain did he call upon heaven and earth for justice he was dragged away before a tribunal where his accusers were his judges who aggravating their iniquity by a mockery of the forms of law confiscated all his merchandise to their own use and threw himself into a loathsome prison for having presumed to attempt trafficking in this country without their permission  i see you are astonished at such a violation of every principle of justice i will therefore unfold the rise of this usurpation to you the hour of rest is yet sufficiently distant and the recital worthy of your attention as happily it may enable you to put your own country on its guard against a like misfortune  end of the third book the history of arsaces prince of betlis book the fourth section i the difference in the produce of the different parts of the world continued the bramin has been justly ascribed to a beneficent design in the creator to raise a friendly intercourse between the inhabitants by laying them under a necessity of applying to each other for the mutual supply of their wants  in such an intercourse this country of all under heaven should naturally seem entitled to the preeminence as having not only every necessary but also every convenience and unhappily almost every luxury of life within itself  but alas it is the use which consecrates the blessing this very plenty is made to disappoint the end for which it was given it blunts the relish of enjoyment and deprives the body of strength and the mind of vigor by taking away the necessity of care and labor wanting nothing we wish not we strive not for any thing but sit in indolent expectation of that which we know the revolving season will bring to us till we become an easy prey to those whose fortunately less favorable clime and soil oblige them to struggle with difficulties and brave dangers in order to procure elsewhere those things which nature has denied to them at home  some years since a company of these prowlers who had wandered across the great ocean from the remotest regions of the west landed upon our coasts in want and wretchedness the hardiness of such an undertaking struck us we received them with humanity we relieved their necessities and gave them the good things of our land in exchange for trifles whose only value arose from their novelty  nor did we stop there engaged by the artifices and respecting the undaunted spirits of those our new acquaintances we permitted them to erect habitations on our coasts to which they might bring their merchandises in future times and from this illjudged hospitality have proceeded all the miseries which at present overwhelm our country and will probably bring it to utter ruin in the end  the accounts which these adventurers gave of our wealth and easiness to part with it at their return home encouraged others to make the same adventure they came in such numbers as should have alarmed a just suspicion of their design they fortified their habitations under pretext of defense against injuries never intended them but in reality to secure their depredations and overawe our sovereigns whom they forced to enter into treaty with them on terms of equality  since that time their conduct has been a continued series of the most atrocious crimes hardier in their nature they take advantage of our pusillanimity and weakness and unrestrained by those obligations which are the safeguards of society the assurance of justice and peace they break through every thing which would oppose their will and laugh at our credulity for having thought them capable of good faith  they grind the faces of the poor the husbandman dares not to taste the fruits of his own labor the artificer to sell the work of his hands without their permission a permission for which they make the wretches pay so dearly that all industry is discouraged and the blessings of nature turned into the severest curse by being thus withheld from them though within their reach  nor are their outrages confined to the poor they make our princes pass under harrows of iron and lead our kings into captivity to extort their wealth from them how long heaven in its wrath will suffer them to continue this flagitious course i presume not to divine but this is evident that if there is not a sudden stop put to their ravages this country will be reduced to the same state of desolation with its unhappy neighbor farsistan  section ii when i was preparing to depart the next morning my host asked me how long i intended to remain in that city and with an air of benevolence offered me every service in his power as i never interfere with the concerns of any man said he i flatter myself that i am beloved by the people of my own nation nor am i persecuted by the strangers because my profession is a pledge for my poverty on the contrary they affect to show me kindness in order to lighten the charge of their treating all the natives with indiscriminate cruelty  his saying this struck me with the thought of soliciting his intercession for my unfortunate fellowtraveller it was possible he might be able to serve him and the attempt was a duty superior to those prudential motives upon which the admonition of my father against interfering in the concerns of another was founded  i should be undeserving of your service i answered o venerable father could i hesitate a moment to accept the offer of it in an instance which will overpay to your benevolent heart any trouble it may give you  i left my native country to travel in search of knowledge and came to this city in company with the unhappy merchant whose misfortune you related to me yesterevening if you can procure his release from prison that will be the highest service which can be done to me in this place as for his wealth let that remain with the spoilers his liberty is all i ask  this was the first time the bramin had heard the sound of my voice he fixed his eyes steadfastly upon me while i was speaking and as soon as i had ended i equally respect the motive of your traveling he answered and the advances you have made in the attainment of it wisdom only could have maintained silence on so interesting an occasion till a reason of such weight made it necessary for you to speak  but o my son you overrate my consequence with these people they are civil to me only because i require not any thing from them but though i may not be able of myself to accomplish your beneficent purpose i may possibly find the means of enabling you to effect it and heaven this moment inspires the lucky thought  the stranger who rules in this city has a desire to inform himself in the affairs of all the neighboring nations and spoke to me not long since to seek a person capable of giving him this information if you therefore can speak the language of his country for he knows not any other and will undertake so irksome a task i will this day lead you to him and heaven may give you an opportunity of serving your friend in some favorable moment of that intercourse which such an occupation must necessarily give you with him  i was involved in the greatest perplexity by this proposal to embrace it must put a stop to my travels which was contrary to my firmest resolution as the time drew near when i had promised to return to my father if i rejected it i gave up the hope of delivering an honest man from unjust oppression and misery the choice was distressing but i hesitated not long  i have some little knowledge i answered o my father in the language you mention i learned it from this unhappy man and can never apply it to better purpose than to serve him in his present distress the task it is true will interrupt my travels but it will at the same time bring me nearer to the end of them in the practice of virtue consists the only true wisdom  the bramin applauded my resolution we went directly to the habitation of the ruler in whose antichamber we were obliged to wait a considerable time before we could be admitted to the honor of his presence  section iii i had seen something in my native country of the slavery of such attendancies but never had i formed any conception of such a scene as i was now in every passion which could agitate every vice which could deform the heart of man was painted in the various faces round me while suspicion deceit envy cruelty and avarice dictated every word they spoke to each other  figure to yourself a set of men thrown together by the incidents of an indigent life from every class of mankind and every country under heaven acting or rather preposterously attempting to act the most important parts and you will have some notion of the company in which i was a company to whose characters the powers of description are so unequal that nothing but the indisputable proof of facts could make them pass for other than mere creatures of imagination  my soul sickened at the sight and i was almost driven to give up my purpose and depart for fear of being infected by such society when the bramin and i were summoned to our audience  we found the great man lolling on a sopha in all the mimickry of state his awkward uneasiness under which showed his inexperience in the reality all was bustle hurry and confusion his orders contradicted each other every moment he knew not what he ought to approve and therefore placed his judgment in finding fault as he showed his greatness by looking with contempt at every thing around him  our entrance was announced to his excellency by a servant on a bent knee but though he was at that very instant looking at us he continued to adjust his dress for some time before he condescended to honor us with the least notice till at length throwing his eye toward us as by chance he superciliously asked the bramin the occasion of his visit  son of good fortune answered the bramin i have found such a person as you desired me to seek for you the last time i had the honor of paying my duty to your greatness and have brought him to receive your commands  his excellency rolling his eye back and forward from the bramin to me for some moments with a suspicious stare at length demanded to know what person he meant  a person answered the bramin who has traveled through all the neighboring nations and is acquainted with their customs and manners in which you expressed a desire to be instructed  not i indeed replied his excellency with a look and accent of offended importance you quite misunderstood me i want no instruction in such matters what i spoke to you about was a secretary for foreign affairs who understands the languages of those countries and can write my orders to the sovereigns of them as i have not time to throw away on learning their jargon myself i regard not their customs and will teach them good manners if they misbehave themselves to me  the mistake returned the bramin is not material my friend is qualified for either office his capacity will be found on trial and i will vouch for his fidelity  such a recommendation had the necessary weight with his excellency who knew the integrity of the bramin and had kept his eye fixed upon me all the time he spoke as if he would read my soul he graciously nodded his assent and saying that i might come as soon as i pleased my conductor and i withdrew rejoiced at the happy omen of having so easily succeeded in the first part of our design  section iv on our return to the habitation of the bramin as you are now entering into a scene of life said he utterly new to you it may not be unnecessary to give you a sketch of the character of the man to whom you are going in order to direct your conduct toward him  the manner in which he bears his present elevation shows that it is not natural to him but you must not form your judgment of him in other respects from thence few men exhibiting a stronger proof that superior talents are far from being the sole property of the superior ranks of life  born in the lowest class of mankind and bred to one of the meanest professions by which industrious poverty strive to earn a scanty subsistence he has raised himself by the mere force of his own genius to his present height of affluence and power a rise it is true to which his principles have contributed little less than his abilities as they never restrained him from any thing by which he could propose advantage a qualification common to almost all the men who have been honored by the world with the name of great  it is but justice though to acknowledge that the actions by which he has thus raised himself have in their first effect merited from his superiors for even he high as he holds himself here is no more than the servant of subjects in his native country all the rewards which they have bestowed upon him  but if we strip those actions of the blazonry of success and measure them by the rules of public as well as private virtue we shall find that by blackening ambition with perfidy corrupting private fidelity and staining victory with murder he has exceeded in the most nefarious iniquity all the ravagers of the earth who have built their greatness upon the miseries of mankind as the consequence will prove that instead of giving sanction to such crimes by loading him with honors his superiors should have punished him with the most ignominious death to have given permanency to the very advantages he has acquired for them the divine vengeance though hitherto suspended being now ready to burst in thunder on their heads for this injustice  his associates emulous of his success in amassing wealth but incapable of effecting it as he had by actions at the same time serviceable to their superiors have imitated him in the most flagitious parts of his conduct and laid the axe to the root of the advantages which they drew from this country by robbing the wretched natives of the means of supplying it for who will work when he knows that the fruit of his labor will be ravished from him  of this indeed they seem to be sensible themselves but instead of being moved by that sense to change their measures they have only changed the object of them  seeing that the ruined land can no longer supply matter for their rapacity they have turned it against their superiors whom they have brought to the verge of equal ruin by a peculation of the wealth entrusted to their care lavishing it in erecting fortresses to guard against impossible assaults and maintaining forces to fight against enemies who do not exist that they may have an opportunity of appointing each other to all the lucrative employments which attend armies and make war at present little less ruinous to the victors than to the vanquished  thus one is to supply materials another to superintend the building this to provide food that clothing for the men and so on arms ammunition every article possible to be wanted by an army for all which as they are to pay themselves they contract in the greatest quantities and at the highest rates which mutual connivance can venture to impose upon common sense at the same time that not one of them has the remotest intention of fulfilling such contracts either in the quantity or quality of the things to be provided but suffer the miserable bands of robbers which they call armies to struggle with all the severities of climates not natural to them and the want of every convenience and almost necessary of life if they can not plunder them from the defenseless and therefore more miserable natives iniquities which however glaring they practice without fear of punishment the wealth they acquire by them enabling them to laugh at justice and hold the laws in defiance in their own country whither they return to enjoy it and make room for another hungry set to pursue their steps  this faithful representation will prove the truth of what i have said before that if a sudden stop be not put to these ravagers our country must be ruined in fact they will soon be forced to stop of necessity their iniquity has undermined itself and heaven by a signal instance of its justice has made them avenge our wrongs upon their own heads whether we may be able to survive the shock and enjoy the fruits of that vengeance though is more than i can foresee so deep are the wounds with which they have pierced our hearts  section v on my repairing next morning to the pavillion of the chief i found him in conversation with a few of his associates on some subject which seemed to embarrass them not a little  as soon as he cast his eyes upon me he turned short to the others and told them with an exulting look that i could give them the information they wanted having traveled lately through all those countries  one of his associates having presumed to express some doubt whether it was safe to entrust a stranger with a matter of such moment the sagacity of the chief took instant offense he asked with a supercilious air when he had been known to be mistaken in any man adding that he had taken me for his secretary on the recommendation of a man of honor not that i wanted any better voucher to a man of discernment than the honesty written in my countenance  the other believing or at least not thinking it proper to disagree with him asked me if there was not a prospect of the greatest plenty in those countries at the approaching harvest and on my bowing in affirmation added a number of questions concerning the prices of the different necessaries of life in different places  it instantly occurred to me that this was such an opportunity as i sought to serve my fellowtraveller i answered therefore that these were matters with which i was utterly unacquainted having never bought any thing but what was immediately necessary for my own use the purpose of my traveling having been only to indulge curiosity and acquire knowledge but that i knew a person who had followed the profession of a merchant for many years and was able to give him every information he could wish in every branch of commerce and on informing him whom i meant gave so high a character of the merchants judgment and probity that they all seemed inclined to employ him  but there was a difficulty in my way which i plainly perceived would defeat my design if it could not be removed this was his merchandise which they had seized and thought he would expect to have restored to him before he would enter into their service a sacrifice to justice which they could not prevail upon themselves to make to any uncertain prospect  on their expressing doubts therefore of the danger of placing confidence in a man utterly unknown to them i replied that they had a security for his honesty in their own hands that they might retain his merchandise till he should execute their commission and then return it or not as he should deserve by which means they would make it his interest to be honest to them  this thought settled the whole affair the chief instantly approved of my proposal paying a compliment to my judgment in making interest the best motive to honesty and i was directly sent to conduct the merchant to them  section vi i cannot express what i felt on entering the dungeon where the unhappy man was confined even without any charge of a real crime dark damp and noisome it seemed to have been designed to render the horrors of imprisonment still more horrible  in the indignation of my soul at such tyranny i could not forbear exclaiming in my native language what a reproach is it to human nature that the men who have themselves been subject to the heavy hand of power are the least proper to be entrusted with it over others  as soon as he heard my wellknown voice he raised his head from the ground on which he lay loaded with chains and looking eagerly at me oh my friend said he have my misfortunes overwhelmed you also is your innocence ruined merely for having known such a wretch as me and yet what is my guilt what have i done to draw this ruin upon me  his fears had taken such possession of his heart that it was difficult to undeceive him as to the cause of my coming difficult to persuade him that there was any prospect of his being restored to his liberty  at length when he saw his chains taken off and the doors of the prison opened to him a new anxiety seized his soul but will they restore me my effects also said he stopping short at the door of the prison and fixing his eyes earnestly upon me if not of what advantage is liberty i had better die here than be obliged to beg my bread among strangers my misery will be shorter at the least  i could scarcely suppress his emotions sufficiently for him to appear before the arbiters of his fate i soothed i comforted i encouraged him to hope the best till i in some measure recalled his reason and made him present to himself for i was not permitted to unfold to him the immediate occasion of his release  when at length i introduced him to them he answered all their questions with precision and undertook to execute their commission without hesitation on condition of having his property restored to him at his return with success  the nature of this commission and the readiness with which he embraced it struck me with such horror that i resolved directly to separate myself both from him and his employers but that very readiness defeated my design it made them suspect that he wanted only to get out of their power and therefore they insisted that i should remain as an hostage for his fidelity  it was impossible for me to avoid agreeing to this condition without exposing him and probably myself also to destruction as they would naturally have concluded that we had concerted a scheme to deceive them i assented therefore with an appearance of readiness to that which i did not dare to refuse and purchased my fellowtravellers liberty at the price of my own at least for some time  the commission entrusted to him was to buy up all the produce of the year from the possessors in order to sell it back to them at an higher price when their necessities should become so pressing as to oblige them to give whatever should be required for it the chief having an assured persuasion that they had buried immense treasures in the earth to evade the exactions of himself and his associates  it may seem improbable to you as it did at the time to me that any people should be so infatuated as to put themselves thus into the power of their known oppressors for their very subsistence but there is nothing so absurd which the force of avarice cannot effect  the merchant on my objecting this difficulty treated it with contempt give them said he this day one penny more than the current price and they will accept it greedily without ever considering what may be the consequence tomorrow present gain is all which is now looked to in the world beside am i not armed with power to compel them should they unexpectedly have the imprudence to refuse complying with my proposals they are in a snare out of which they can no way escape  nor did he pay greater respect to the disapprobation which i could not forbear expressing at the readiness with which he undertook such horrid work  your virtue my friend said he is too refined ever to be carried into practice when placed in the scale against the most powerful principles of human nature i would not willingly commit injustice nor lead any man to ruin but when either he or i must be ruined the trial is too severe and nature will preponderate in spite of all the dreams of speculation  the scenes of which i was a melancholy witness while the merchant was engaged in the execution of his commission were too horrid for description i shall only say that every act of injustice and oppression which avarice and cruelty could suggest to lawless power was practiced openly and with such insolence that the unhappy sufferers did not even dare to lighten their grief by a plaintive sigh  section vii the return of the merchant released me at length from the sight of such misery from the society of men who were a disgrace to the human name  he had executed their commission with unexpected success and as i thought much more faithfully than they performed their promise of rewarding him for it  every time he claimed the restitution of his merchandise some new difficulty was started some new delay made under pretenses the most frivolous and shameless till growing apprehensive that they might complete their injustice by taking away his life to free themselves from his importunity he reduced his demand to the means of support in his return to his native country their condescending to grant which after much entreaty they affected to consider as an act of the greatest generosity and favor  when he was ready to depart he affectionately pressed me to accompany him do not be discouraged my friend said he at the unfortunate issue of our journey hither matters are not so bad as they may appear to be i knew my employers too well to trust entirely to their justice an agent understands but little of his business who can not make it pay itself  had i not before covenanted with my own heart to separate myself from him the very argument on which he rested his solicitation would have determined me to decline it i wished him an happy journey saying that my fate led me another way  i was too well acquainted with the power of habit over the human heart to be surprised at this instance of the merchants measuring justice by the rule of his own interest it was but consistency of character not that i can say i was displeased with the consequence how much soever i disapproved of the motive of his conduct his employers and he had been guilty of equal breaches of trust and i therefore adored that power which thus made one act of injustice punish another  the condition upon which i had consented to stay among these people being thus fulfilled i resolved to take the first opportunity of departing without giving them any notice of my design being taught by their treatment of the merchant what confidence was to be placed in their promises and apprehensive that they might think me too deeply acquainted with the mysteries of their iniquity to dismiss me  while i waited for such an opportunity the success of the merchants commission appeared in effects not to be recollected without horror  the natives as he had predicted either from avarice or compulsion had sold him all the produce of the land which his employers no sooner got into their possession than they raised the prices to such an height that the wretches after having expended every resource to purchase indispensible support were reduced to all the dreadful extremities of famine while the authors of their ruin looked on with unconcern nor would relax their extortion to save the very name of the people from being blotted out from among the inhabitants of the earth  virgins offered themselves to violation in the streets for a mouthful of food the son sold his father into slavery the mother devoured the infant which sucked her breast the living were not able to bury the dead  amid all these horrors my soul had a peculiar consolation for some time the jewels which i had retained by the advice of myrza now served the beneficent purpose for which he had advised me to reserve them i gave them to my friend the bramin who disposed of them and applied the price to the relief of the general distress  but alas he proceeded not with sufficient secrecy he was discovered by the inhuman tyrants he was seized he was put to torture to discover if he had any more and from whom he had received them he preserved his faith to me and died under the torture without making any discovery  unfortunate was it for him that i knew not of his sufferings till they were at an end my life should not have been saved at the price of his  such scenes are difficult to be believed the pride of conscious virtue is unwilling to admit even a possibility of the human natures sinking so low but when it is considered by whom these crimes were perpetrated it will be owned that they were no more than might have been foreseen  the weight of power is too great to be sustained under the most advantageous circumstances it too often intoxicates the best head and warps the best heart what then must its effects be in the opposite extreme how could it rationally be expected that men raised to absolute power from the lowest state of servility and from the lowest poverty should be able to resist the temptation of abusing that power to acquire wealth when such abuse was in a manner justified by practice and encouraged by impunity  section viii as i had been detained by these events beyond the time of my promised return to my father i felt the anxiety of his love for my safety and therefore for the greater expedition embarked secretly in a ship which was intended to sail directly for suez preferring the performance of so dear a duty to any pleasure or advantage which i could promise to myself in the further pursuit of my travels  heaven seemed at first to smile upon our way we sailed with a favorable wind till we entered the straits of dira when a violent storm arose which in despite of all the efforts of our mariners who struggled with it for several days at length drove our ship upon some rocks where she was instantly torn to pieces  it is impossible to describe what i felt in that dreadful moment the darkness of midnight was condensed tenfold by the fury of the storm all was horror and dismay  though the most resolute had lost every hope of escaping we all in the instinctive impulse of selfpreservation laid hold on such pieces of the wreck as chance threw in our way and clinging to them were driven about at the mercy of the winds and waves in which many perished by a milder death than awaited most of those who gained the land  it was my fate to be thrown upon the shore without any appearance of life a situation to which as i afterward found i owed my safety  the day had just begun to dawn when i recovered my senses the first efforts of which served only to present me with scenes still more horrible than that from which i had escaped i found myself entirely naked at some little distance from the sea whither i suppose i must have been dragged for the better convenience of stripping off my clothes  but this treatment however cruel in itself was kindness in comparison of what i saw inflicted on my unhappy companions as many of whom as reached the shore alive were instantly slaughtered and then stripped by the natives who instead of relieving a state of distress which should have moved every humane passion looked upon them and their property as lawful prey  shocked as my soul was at such barbarity nature directed my first thoughts to my own safety i lay as motionless as if i was really dead till i saw the savages depart laden with the spoils of the wretches whom they had slaughtered when raising myself as well as weakness and the pain of many bruises would permit i crept to the sea side to try if i could happily administer relief to any who might have escaped in the same manner with myself and find some clothes to cover me which had been overlooked by the ravagers in the hurry of their rapacity  but i was disappointed at the first in either hope they were too well experienced in the work to leave it unfinished and i was just going to depart though i knew not whither when casting my eyes once more wishfully to the sea i thought i perceived something floating toward the shore  the storm having by this time nearly spent its force i ventured into the water to see what the object before me might be when i found one of my fellowpassengers with whom i had contracted a particular intimacy with his arms clasped round a coffer to which he was tied i instantly raised his head above the water and perceiving some signs of life exerted all my strength to draw him up on the dry land where my care soon restored him to his senses  the moment he opened his eyes and saw me busied about him his situation suggested itself to him in the worst light my being naked preventing his knowing me and making him imagine i was one of the spoilers with whose nefarious practices he was too well acquainted lifting his hands therefore in a suppliant manner o spare my life said he spare the life of an old man who will never disturb your possession of what you have acquired  what i returned do you not know me can hassan be taken for a spoiler by his friend  he started on hearing my voice and looking eagerly at me is it possible said he can i be so happy but where is the coffer to which i was bound if that is lost my life is of little value to me  i then showed him the coffer where it still lay in the water upon which he arose with a vigor not to have been expected from his situation and running toward it let us then secure it instantly said he before the spoilers come or they will not only rob us of all it contains but murder us also to secure the spoil  as soon as he had drawn it to the land he opened the locks and taking out a casket put it into his bosom and was preparing to depart without seeming even to think of any thing else  such an insensibility to the situation i was in affected me how said i and will my friend desert me thus naked and alone  he started and pausing for a moment as if just awakened from a dream desert you he returned no never will i desert my preserver but what can we do the spoilers will come upon us the moment they discover that our ship has been wrecked the vulture is not more quick to find his prey nor the tiger more cruel than the inhabitants of the seacoasts to destroy those whom the more merciful waves throw into their power  i then acquainted him that they had been already there showing him the slaughtered bodies on the shore to which i added my own condition as proofs of their bloody rapacity  his thoughts were so intently fixed upon himself that he seemed to have no feeling for the misfortunes of any other thank heaven said he embracing the casket that we have escaped though and that my jewels are safe but we must not remain here as soon as they have left their spoil at home they will return to try if they can glean up any more i will share my garments with thee for the present we shall soon be able to procure every thing we want  he was proceeding to strip himself when the occasion was unhappily removed the sea threw up near to the place where we stood the body of one of our companions whom finding to be dead i yielded to the horrid necessity of taking his clothes to cover myself  section ix we had not advanced far into the country before we discovered a cottage the poor appearance of which showed the poverty of its inhabitants  on our approaching the door which stood open to give light to the family whom we found seated around a little fire at a meal of simple vegetables the master invited us in the most hospitable manner to partake of his humble fare  though i knew him at the first cast of my eye to be one of those who had been most active in murdering and spoiling my unhappy companions my astonishment was not greater at the present contrast in his conduct than to hear him address us in the byrsan language  gracious heaven i exclaimed where am i is it possible that this is the country of the byrsans that such barbarous crimes should be committed in defiance of the most beneficent laws  the cottager who knew not the cause of my exclamation appeared to be surprised nor made me any answer till i repeated my question when he informed me that i was in my native country  but my companion who understood my meaning having often heard me boast of the laws of byrsa as superior to those of all other nations would not miss such an occasion of reproving my vain partiality why should not such crimes said he be committed in this country as soon as in any other it is not the laws but the execution of them which has an effect upon the manners of a people the best laws if badly administered only encourage the crimes which they were designed to prevent  the cottager having directed us the way to byrsa returned to the seacoast to seek for more spoil in contempt of every argument i could use to dissuade him while we proceeded toward the house of my father my heart panting with filial love and joy at the thought of being so near him  the contradiction between the conduct of the cottager when at home and on the shore was so striking that i could not forbear expressing my surprise to my companion who accounted for it in a manner most disgraceful to the polity of any civilized people  the nature of man said he is in itself benevolent cruelty is ever the consequence of error in opinion or of bad example in his cottage you saw this man in his natural character his conduct on the shore proceeded from a notion derived from the laws of times of ignorance and barbarity that the plunderers could not be compelled to make restitution of their spoil if no man belonging to a ship which was wrecked remained alive to claim it  if then the legislature of byrsa really merited the praise which you have so lavishly bestowed upon it would not proper means have been taken to eradicate such a notion and prevent its horrid consequences by confiscating to the state every wreck where all the people perished and on the other hand allowing a part thereof to the inhabitants of the coast in proportion to the number of lives saved by them instead of the present absurd method of punishment for plundering which they evade by murdering all who might prove their guilt  though this objection was not to be answered i could not suppress the exultation of my heart at the appearance of happiness which shone in every place we passed through as we advanced toward the capital nor forbear pointing it out to my companion as the best vindication of our laws  but he viewed matters in another light moderate your pride said he till you see whether it is well founded when i view the face of the country i think myself in paradise but when i consider the inhabitants my opinion is much less favorable the extremities of the land are uncultivated for want of people who crowd to the metropolis where their labor is wasted in works of vanity the whole nation is drowned in luxury they are poor in the midst of plenty they have much but they want still more their powers both of mind and body are weakened by excess their principles debauched by prosperity in a word their happiness has overflowed its bounds and if this calm continues much longer byrsa will overset in the first storm which shall fall with any force upon it  section x my meeting with my father is not to be described he had been for some time sinking under the infirmities of age and seemed to have struggled to preserve life only till he could resign it in my bosom  the moment he was informed of my arrival he called me eagerly to him and throwing his arms around my neck as i kneeled by the side of his bed it is enough said he gracious heaven it is enough i embrace him once more and now i die content   then pausing a few moments to recover his spirits unequal to such an excess of joy o bless my son he continued enable him to save his  he would have added country but the word died unfinished on his tongue heaven not permitting him to prefer a prayer which must be ineffectual and he expired without a groan in my arms  having performed the last duties to his honored remains i determined to devote the residue of my days to the cultivation of my mind in retirement every thing i saw around me giving me a disgust to the world  i had found such pleasure in the conversation of my late fellowsufferer in the shipwreck whose benevolence of heart and judicious acquaintance with the ways of man opened themselves upon me more and more every hour that i would have persuaded him to remain with me  but all my persuasions were ineffectual he had fixed his mind upon returning to his native city of cairo and there ending his days among his family we parted with the sincerest sentiments of mutual esteem  section xi i have informed you of the claim which the byrsans made to the neighboring country of the coptes it had pleased heaven to lead me home just as their army was preparing to march to enforce that claim  though i had determined upon a retired life the principles in which i had been educated by my father making me disapprove a measure so contrary to justice i thought it my first duty to endeavor to prevent it before i would attend to any thing which related solely to myself  i resolved therefore to demand an audience of the king to whom my rank in the state gave me a right of speaking my sentiments on public affairs and lay before him the reasons of my dissenting from the general voice on so important an occasion not doubting but i should be able to open his eyes to the evils which must necessarily result from it  the war appeared to me so flagrantly unjust that i imagined there must be some secret reasons for it to which my absence had made me a stranger or it could never have been resolved on before therefore i would presume to oppose it i thought it necessary to enquire more particularly into the matter as i knew the danger of judging on a partial view  for this purpose i went directly to a person whose having held several of the first offices in the state i concluded must enable him to give me the information i wanted and which an alliance between our houses gave me a right to require  on entering his habitation i was surprised to find every thing wear a gloomy aspect the very looks of the servants spoke an unhappy master he received me with an air of dignity and respect but clouded with a reserve which made it disagreeable and seemed desirous to confine his conversation to general questions relating to the countries which i had seen in my travels  this however gave me an easy opportunity of leading him to the subject of the approaching war without expressly declaring the purpose of my coming which i apprehended might have made him still more reserved i therefore as occasionally desired to know his opinion of it as a direction to mine which probably for want of proper information i owned to be against it  at the first mention of the affair i saw his eyes sparkle with indignation which arose as i proceeded till it entirely dissipated the gloom which hung upon his brow and broke through his reserve  i am happy said he with a look of the warmest complacency to find your sentiments concur with mine on this important occasion for if you are not satisfied with the apparent much less will you be with the real motives of this war the former have at least something like a color however false of justice because it was necessary to deceive the people who can never be led into any thing which they know to be unjust how easily soever they may be deceived but the latter are a mystery of the grossest iniquity in every sense  good heaven i returned whence can this proceed the youth of our sovereign opened with the fairest hopes  nor has he ever fallen from those hopes interrupted he eagerly one vice has never stained his private life one act of injustice warped his public conduct yet still a character less pure might have proved more advantageous to his people to form a proper judgment of a man his station must be considered the virtues most sublime in a subject are often but amiable weaknesses in a sovereign  i see that your absence has made you a stranger to the secret springs upon which our government moves at this time the balance between its parts and their mutual check upon each other which gave it the preeminence over all the other governments upon earth exist now only in name  the superior council by dissipating the property appointed to support its independance is fallen absolutely under the influence of the crown as the inferior daily betrays to it the trust committed to them to acquire matter for a like dissipation the gratification of luxury being the only object attended to by every class of mankind  you may naturally conclude that the power of the sovereign must become absolute by this prostration of the fences instituted to restrain it but the contrary is the fact all the power which he seems to obtain in this manner is wasted in the very means made use of to obtain it and himself kept in a kind of slavery to the instruments of this corruption in which they have so entangled the whole system of government that it now appears to be one of its first principles and often compels him to give the sanction of his name and authority to measures the most contrary to his own sentiments of which there can not be a stronger instance than this war which is literally forced upon him by his servants though as contrary to their inclinations as to his their ambition and abilities being equally limited to the dark works of seduction  but the people have of late begun to look so narrowly into their conduct and to show such symptoms of discontent that apprehensive of the consequence they adopted this expedient to turn the attention of the public from themselves blazoning the war with such hopes of private advantage as have made the injustice of it easily pass unnoticed  nor is the power of this hope to be wondered at we have lived so far beforehand that it is terrifying to look forward not only private fortunes are wasted by the luxury which is expressly encouraged by the court for that purpose that people may become dependant on its favor for support but the very resources of the state are anticipated to such a depth in order to support this system of corruption that far from being able to stand any violent shock we must of necessity sink by our own weight if we are not saved by some means impossible for human reason to provide  the whole system of mens souls if i may use the expression must be changed and another adopted in every respect opposite to it an effect which can be produced only by some heavy misfortune if such can be surmounted which shall bring the government back to its first principles  for my own part i am so sick of a world in which i see nothing but folly and vice that if there is not a sudden change which i have no reason to expect i will anticipate the stroke of fate and quiet it  the horrid resolution with which he concluded this melancholy representation aggravated the pain it gave me ten thousand fold o beware i exclaimed of indulging so dangerous a thought of tempting the wrath of heaven by diffidence in its goodness and power a crime which reason and religion equally forbid and madness only can excuse  reason he answered prompts me to fly from evil   but not to a greater i interrupted eagerly not to evils from which there is no flying no hoping for relief  of those evils he replied with a contemptuous smile i know nothing the phantoms with which superstitious ignorance was so long terrified are at length seen through nature seeks happiness and if i can not find it in this life i must follow the pursuit into another if such there is it is better not to be than be unhappy  i attempted not to argue with him farther as i could plainly see by the manner in which he expressed himself that contradiction would only confirm him more strongly in his opinion and perhaps stimulate his vanity to hasten the execution of it  section xii i was diverted from the painful reflections which such a scene naturally suggested at my return by the entrance of a person who had been one of the most intimate acquaintances of my early youth  as i had been informed that he had wasted his fortune in every mode of idle dissipation and expense i was most agreeably surprised at his appearance every thing in which spoke affluence and a mind at ease he saluted me with the warmest professions of regard and we instantly continued our former intimacy as if it had never been interrupted  after some reciprocal inquiries of personal affection i informed him of the conversation which had passed at the visit from which i was just returned  he paused a few moments as struck by what i had said then with a look not well assured i shall not pretend he answered to vindicate in all things either the measures of the government or the manners of the age but the motives of this persons disapprobation greatly weaken the force of it he speaks from the rage of disappointment not from principle  that political corruption against which he inveighs with such acrimony did he himself carry to such lengths when in power that it was too gross to be supported and occasioned his deposal nor is there a moral vice which has not stained his character but as some of these vices have been retorted against himself and he is no longer permitted to practice that corruption he now declaims against it in this manner but you must not trust too implicitly to his representations because the world does not go as he likes he modestly says it is going to ruin  the human heart is so fond of happiness that we give easy credit to what we wish i looked upon the gloomy picture which had been drawn to me to have proceeded merely from the clouds which overcast the painters mind and did not doubt but my friend would set every thing in a very different light  i therefore desired him to acquaint me if there were any reasons for the approaching war beside those publicly given which i scrupled not to say were so flagrantly unjust that i had resolved to exert my utmost endeavors to prevent it  my dear friend he answered staring at me with surprise what you say may possibly be very true but these are matters about which i never give myself any trouble  how i returned astonished at what he said not give yourself trouble about matters of the greatest importance to a state in which you hold so high a rank in the government of which you have ever undertaken a part not to be executed without trouble you are not you can not be serious but this is a subject most improper for pleasantry  i speak my sentiments i assure you he replied i never did nor ever will give myself trouble about any thing if i would have taken trouble with matters of this nature i might probably have conducted them myself my purpose is to enjoy the pleasures of life while i can without troubling myself about consequences which all my trouble may not be able to prevent  but said i interrupting him shortly if you were determined not to take trouble why did you take an office which required it you know my plainness is it consistent with a just sense of honor or even with common honesty to take the wages without doing the work  you were always an enthusiast he answered with a forced smile and i find you will ever remain one i was in hope that seeing the world would have opened your mind and shown you the absurdity of such antiquated notions i took the office because i had occasion for the emoluments of it as the vizier gave it to attach me to his interest and on the same terms is every office given and accepted  if you imagine that any one under the vizier presumes in virtue of his office to do any thing you are utterly mistaken it is he who virtually does every thing and all the other officers of the state are no better than ciphers following him to add to his consequence  section xiii but let us wave a subject on which we only waste our time i have come to request a favor from you which i promise myself you will not refuse me  you must know that i am in one of the most whimsical situations possible to be conceived you remember our old friend mago the intimacy which begun with our lives has continued to this day though it was lately endangered by one of the oddest accidents which ever happened can you think it possible that he and i should fall in love with each others wife and succeed in our loves too  for some time matters went on as smoothly as we could wish neither of us suspecting the other till growing too secure he happened one day to surprise his wife and me in a situation of more familiarity than common forms allow you know his hasty temper he drew his sabre instantly and advanced to attack me  i am not a coward but i know not how it happened a qualm of conscience i suppose came upon me and i did not care to run the hazard of losing my own life in so foolish a cause or adding his death to the injury i had already done him  i therefore demanded a parley sword in hand and after some preliminaries in making which i believe i looked silly enough i frankly told him that in the way he sought satisfaction the odds were against him but that if he would take my advice i could direct him to a better which would bring us more upon a level this was to return me in kind the good office i had done him and then there would be nothing to complain of on either side  the look he gave me as i said this is not to be described he fixed his eyes upon me for a few moments to see if i was serious then bursting into a loud laugh give me your hand brother said he i applaud your prudence and to tell you a secret have not waited for your permission to do what you propose so let us even shake hands and make the best of our bargains  from that day all was harmony and goodfellowship between us to make which as we thought the stronger and as the affair had some way taken wind we repudiated our own wives respectively and wedded those of each other to satisfy their delicacy and repair their reputations   my indignation which had been rising still higher at every word he spoke could be restrained no longer how i exclaimed wed a woman of whose dishonor you were yourself a witness what though you were an accomplice in her guilt your participation lessened not the crime in her nor can you expect that she will be more faithful to you than she was to your friend in the first step is all the difficulty a woman who has once surmounted that seldom feels any reluctance to proceed in the same way beside your own honor   you are too squeamish quite too squeamish he interrupted not desiring to hear more the world is grown wiser than to view these matters in so serious a light as formerly how can a mans honor be injured by the levity of a woman that is another of those antiquated absurdities which are now only laughed at and you will soon be ashamed of  as to her future conduct that is her own affair if she should be caught tripping she knows the consequence what is past is nothing custom has sanctified these matters  but to return to my purpose the mischief now is that this second marriage has spoiled all whether it is the thought of restraint or that there is something disgusting in the name of matrimony i know not but so it has happened that we were all soon surfeited of our exchange and wished for our own back again  now as this is a new case which will create a good deal of impertinent noise and be attended with much trouble and delay what i propose is to have a law made which shall authorize an exchange of wives as often as all the parties are willing and then the numbers who i know will take advantage of it will keep us in countenance  the favor therefore which i have to request of you is to introduce the matter for me to the legislature as a thought of your own which occurred to you in your travels on observing the evils which universally attend indissoluble marriages  the sobriety of your character will give weight to the scheme and obviate the personal allusions which would be made if i were to take the lead in it myself you may also to make the thing still more popular add that no single man shall suffer for having an amor with a married woman provided he will take her off her husbands hands and marry her himself which will endear you to all ranks of people much more than opposing the war such marriages though allowed at present and sometimes practiced being attended with so much trouble and expense that very few can afford them whereby many a wife is obliged to baulk her inclinations and many an husband to wear his horns in silence for want of such a law to relieve them  section xiv i know not whether my indignation or contempt was most moved by this proposal such a law as you mention i replied seems to be the only thing wanted to complete that dissoluteness which marks the character of the byrsan nation with deeper disgrace than ever dishonored any other people  a legislature which had a just sense of honor instead of authorizing would use every possible means to prevent such infamous marriages marriages which defeat the very intention of marriage by providing a reward for that breach of faith which it was instituted to prevent  the law too evidently necessary is to brand public vice with public infamy and prevent a repetition of the breach of matrimonial fidelity by prohibiting the offender from ever marrying again indeed so sacred should the honor of the female sex be held that a woman who could so far forget her own dignity as to suffer seduction even in a state of freedom and without the additional guilt of conjugal infidelity should not be admitted to marry even with her seducer as the crime is indelible the punishment should be inevitable  such was the sense of that people whose superior virtue overturned the dissolute city of carthage and forced our ancestors to fly from their native country a fate which evidently threatens their degenerate offspring and this more dissolute city of byrsa  saying which i turned away in disdain waving my hand to him to depart  the horror with which i was struck by the conversation of these men is not to be expressed i held it as impossible that a state in which the only firm bond of human connection moral virtue is universally broken should not separate and fall to ruin as i know it to be for any other than religious principles to support man through the evils inevitably incident to his nature a truth confirmed by too many melancholy instances among the byrsans who ignorant of the illimitable extent of divine mercy or not daring to look up to it sunk into despair on the lightest disappointment and rashly threw away lives which a better sense might have rendered happy to themselves and useful to their country  discouraged as i was by these reflections i knew it to be my duty not to despair of the public welfare or relax my endeavors to promote it and therefore resolved to go without farther delay to the king and lay my sentiments of the war before him  as i was departing from my own habitation for this purpose i was stopped by a stranger who said with a mysterious look that he had an affair of importance to impart to me  on my retiring with him into an inner chamber he told me he was sorry to trouble me on a disagreeable occasion but that his friendship for the person who had just left me would not permit his refusing to come from him to demand satisfaction for my treatment of him in our last conversation  such a demand struck me with the strongest astonishment i answered that his friend must certainly be mistaken as i could not charge myself with having treated him or any other man ill in my life  i suppose he thought i was terrified and therefore that he might the more safely press upon me he replied with an haughty air that his friend had too high a sense of honor to be satisfied with so poor an evasion and that i must either instantly meet him or take the consequence of my cowardice  but he overacted his part such a menace instead of fear or resentment raised only my contempt i answered him with the coldest indifference that i was surprised to hear honor attributed to a man who by his own confession had forfeited every claim to it and that if he thought himself aggrieved by my treatment of him he must correct the conduct which had given occasion for it and then he need not fear meeting the like from me again  such a repulse showed him his error lowering the tone of his voice he said he hoped i would consider that it was a delicate point and wished some method could be found to adjust it without coming to extremities  but this moderation was affected too late i replied that i knew no method but that which i had proposed of his changing his conduct in life upon which i would certainly change mine to him and not till then and that as for the consequences which he had thought proper to threaten i gave myself no concern about them as i had too just a respect for true honor to pay any to the shadow which he affected to worship or submit my own principles to public opinion by descending to put myself on a level with a man who had given up every thing really respectable in the human character  this was an answer he seemed not to have been prepared for he paused for some minutes as if considering what to reply and then withdrew without even attempting to speak another word  section xv as soon as the agitation naturally raised by such a scene had subsided i went to the king and in the humility of loyal duty examined before him the cause and looked forward to the consequences of the war and having shown that these were as dangerous as that was unjust besought him to interpose his authority to prevent it  he heard me with attention and even seemed struck with what i said but without attempting to refute it answered in general terms that the war was already resolved upon and the minds of the people so intent upon it that it was impossible to resist them  severely as i was affected by this repulse it was not the only thing which gave me pain on the occasion no sooner was my disapprobation of the war known than i was appointed to a principal command in the army prepared to carry it on  to a person unacquainted with the principles which prevailed among the byrsans at that time this must appear a designed insult but no such thing was thought of it was intended as a mark of respect as a gratification of the purpose of my opposition this must be explained  there is no human institution however wise and salutary in its natural effects which the depravity of man can not pervert to the most pernicious purposes  the great council which narbal had appointed to assist the sovereign in the difficulties of government with their advice and watch over the interests of the people with which they as a part must necessarily be better acquainted than he could be often acted directly contrary to that intention losing all consequence under a spirited and politic prince and on the other hand when one of a different character offered opportunity rising upon his weakness and usurping the power while he had only the name of sovereignty  in the former instance honorary distinctions and the emoluments of government always afforded a prince who had abilities to apply them properly the means of influencing the members of the council and making them subservient to his purpose but those which they employed against him may not be so obvious to you though they were equally ready  as the council had a right to deliberate upon the measures of government it was easy for a designing member to carp at such as though necessary and strictly just might appear exceptionable to a superficial view in which he was sure of being followed by the unthinking populace as the tutelary assertor and guardian of their rights till they raised him to such a consequence as enabled him to enhance the price of his acquiescence with the will of the prince or perhaps wrest his authority out of his hands  nothing could be a stronger proof of the wisdom of narbal than that even so gross an abuse of his institution was not sufficient to counterbalance the advantages arising from this council and make the abolition of it necessary the very means by which this abuse was perpetrated preventing the obvious and worst consequences of it and preserving the great principles of the government from being lost  for in order to acquire this popularity it was necessary to explain those principles to the people who soon saw their interest and ability to preserve them and though they joined in their abuse would never have submitted to their being fundamentally overturned  on this system therefore the vizier judging of me by all those who had on other occasions opposed public measures concluded that the readiest way of gaining me to his interest was to give me this command the inconsistency of my accepting which with my opposition to the war was sufficiently countenanced by the general practice  but such an example had no weight with me and i refused his offer with indignation till my sovereign himself condescending to request my compliance personal respect to him and a sense of the sacred duty of subjection obliged me to accept it however contrary to my inclination  how blind interrupted temugin will attachment to a favorite system make the best informed mind this man who wanted not wisdom in other matters could see no imperfection in the principles of a government which teemed with the cause of its own dissolution from the first hour it was instituted a state in which the power of the sovereign can be counterbalanced by that of his subjects is like a body without an head and must necessarily fall to ruin  i will hear the conclusion of his story at some other time  end of the first volume
