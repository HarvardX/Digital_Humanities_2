macbeth reconsidered an essay  price one shilling  macbeth reconsidered an essay intended as an answer to part of the remarks on some of the characters of shakspeare  london printed for t and j egerton whitehall  mdcclxxxvi  to edmund malone this essay is inscribed by his obedient and obliged servant  the author  advertisement to the reader the passages printed in italics are quotations from mr wheatleys remarks and the references correspond with the edition of shakspeare given by johnson and stevens       macbeth reconsidered plays are designed by the joint powers of precept and example to have a good influence on the lives of men enquiries into the conduct of fable in the drama were useless to this end the regular or irregular disposition of parts in a play is an artificial praise or blame that can contribute nothing to the improvement or depravation of the mind for the cause of morality is promoted only when by a catastrophe resulting from principles natural to the agents who produce it we are taught to love virtue and abhorvice  neglect of unity is the obvious fault of shakspeares pieces truth of manners their unrivalled excellence  this essay does not profess to observe upon any inconsistency in the conduct of the tragedy of macbeth it concerns itself only with the sentiments of the hero of it presuming they will more effectually serve ethics if in analyzing his character it shows that there is no distinction between him and king richard in the quality of personal courage if macbeth be what mr wheatley describes him we must forego our virtuous satisfaction in his repugnance to guilt for it arises from mere cowardice and can gain no instruction from his remorse for it is only the effect of imbecility we despise him we cannot feel for him and shall never be amended by a wretch who is uniformly the object of our contempt  the writer of these pages does not consider that his position will never be established till mr wheatleys be overthrown without perceiving how difficult and apparently invidious a task he undertakes he relies however upon shakspeare to clear macbeth from the imputation laid on his nature and can truly say the argument is not taken up in a spirit of controversy but out of a love for what is believed to be just criticism  having given many judicious proofs of the difference there certainly is in the characters of macbeth and richard mr wheatley proceeds to the article of courage and says in richard it is intrepidity and in macbeth no more than resolution in him macbeth it proceeds from exertion not from nature in enterprise he betrays a degree of fear though he is able when occasion requires to stifle and subdue it  the attempt to controvert this doctrine naturally resolves itself into three heads namely a repetition of the simple character of macbeth as it stands before any change is effected in it by the supernatural soliciting of the weird sisters a consideration of his conduct toward banquo and macduff and a review of his deportment as opposed to richards in the remarks this order will involve an inquiry into mr wheatleys interpretation of the poets text into the appositeness of the facts adduced in support of hi opinion and into his philosophy of the pecliar passion of characters when facts not supplying testimony he can substantiate his hypothesis only on the evidence of appropriated sentiment  an appeal for judgment on the nature of macbeths courage lies to the tribunal of shakspeare himself the circumscribed nature of a drama renders it generally impracticable for the principal personages in it gradually to unfold themselves it is therefore an allowed artifice with dramatic authors and of which they commonly avail themselves by an impressive description of their heroes to bring us in a great measure acquainted with them before they are actually engaged in scenes where for want of such previous intelligence their proceedings might appear at best confused and generally perhaps inexplicable we are bound then to receive the introductory portrait our author has drawn of macbeth as a true resemblance for a creature of the poets arbitrary creation may be assimilated only to those features which he has thought fit to give him here is the picture   the merciless macdonel   from the western isles of kernes and gallowglasses is supplied and fortune on his damned quarrel smiling showed like a rebels whore but all is too weak for brave macbeth well he deserves that name disdaining fortune with his brandished steel which smoked with bloody execution like valors minion carved out his passage till he faced the slave and never shook hands nor bade farewell to him till he unseamd him from the nave to the chops p     v   could shakspeare call a man brave and insist upon his well deserving that appellation could he grace a man with the title of valors minion and deem him as he does in a subsequent passage worthy to be matched even with the goddess of war  could he do this and not design to impress a full idea of the dignity of his courage macbeths great heart pants to meet the merciless leader of the rebels his executing sword all dyed in reeking gore hews out a passage to him he maintains the combat till the death of his antagonist crowns his persistive valor with the victory he burned for  it is said macbeth has resolution not intrepidity what is the soldiers intrepidity but disdaining fortune  it is objected though with some qualification that macbeths courage proceeds from exertion not from nature and that in enterprise he betrays a deal of fear let us turn to the portrait once more  cap no sooner justice had with valor armed compelled these skipping kernes to trust their heels but the norweyan lord surveying vantage with furbishd arms and new supplies of men began a fresh assault  king dismayed not this our captains macbeth and banquo  cap yes as sparrows eagles or the hare the lion  p     v   the thane of rosse takes up the narrative  norway himself with terrible numbers   began a dismal conflict till that bellonas bridegroom lapt in proof confronted him with selfcomparisons point against point rebellious arm against arm curbing his lavish spirit and to conclude the victory fell on us  p     v    is it to betray fear in enterprise already worn with the fatigues of a hardfought field to rush at disadvantage on fresh supplies and terrible numbers unconcerned as eagles when they swoop on sparrows and lions when they strike a hare it cannot be the labored effect of exertion it is the spontaneous impulse of a dauntless nature that again hurries bellonas bridegroom through all the horrors of a dismal conflict to single out and hold the royal invader point against point till his resistless arm has curbed his lavish spirit and raised on his discomfiture the trophies of a second conquest  macbeth now enters in the scene and a deputation from the sovereign meets him with these gracious acknowledgements to his triumphant valor  the king has happily received macbeth the news of thy success and when he reads thy personal venture in the rebels ight his wonder and his praises do contend which should be thine or his silenced with that in viewing over the rest of the selfsame day he finds thee in the stout norweyan ranks nothing afraid of what thyself did make strange images of death as thick as tale came post with post and every one did bear thy praises in his kingdoms great defense   for an earnest of a greater honor he bade me from him call thee thane of cawdor p     v   the king congratulates macbeth on his success and professes that the praise due to his personal venture in the first battle is lost in silent wonder at the sublimity of his daring how inexpressible then are duncans feelings when he finds him once more engaged the selfsame day in the stout norweyan ranks careless of meeting that death which he was so terribly dealing on the squadrons that surrounded him the king confers the forfeited honors of the disloyal cawdor upon his general only as a token of those higher dignities which all conspire to think his achievements in the kingdoms great defense have justly merited  such is the character shakspeare attributes to macbeth while yet the pureness of his conscience is uncontaminated by guilt the impetuosity of glamis is the decision of intrepidity the feats of his own hand assure to him the renown of gallantry and the whole tenor of his conduct throughout this perilous adventure unequivocally displays a soul that with othellos may  agnize a natural and prompt alacrity it finds in hardness  p     v  0  we come now to the second part of this question the remarks affirm that macbeth is personally afraid of banquo and that his fear is founded on the superior courage of the other  the evidence which is given in of banquos superior courage may perhaps on examination seem but of little weight whence are the proofs of macbeths cowardice to be brought not from his behavior in battle it does not appear that upon the first meeting of the witches macbeth is agitated much more than banquo banquos description of their figures and his several pertinent questions to them amounting though to no more than two are not expressive of mere curiosity but of the surprise with which himself and his partner are equally affected on their unexpectedly encountering three objects of so grotesque an appearance  what are these so withered and so wild in their attire that look not like the inhabitants of the earth and yet are on it  live you or are you ought that man may question  p  0  v   if macbeth only repeats the same inquiry it is not from timidity but from a wish for the same information and when he does it shortly he indicates his impatience for an answer  why should the speeches of macbeth and banquo in this scene appear to be injudiciously distributed and how will the difference in their characters account for such a distribution banquo addresses the witches first banquo is made to see them first not in token of superiority but merely perhaps that their ceremonious silence to him  each at once her choppy finger laying upon her skinny lips  p  0  v   may heighten the solemnity of the prophetic greeting with which they are about to hail macbeth yet the distribution of the parts is of so little moment that it might have happened fortuitously to have done however with conjecture the context evinces that it is not produced for the purpose of showing banquos superiority in being perfectly calm under an occurrence that has ruffled macbeth  if macbeth is amazed when he sees the witches are vanished and likens their disappearance to the melting of breath into the wind banquo is struck too and compares them in their sudden evanescence to the bursting bubbles of the water  p     v   banquo cannot be said to treat the witches with contempt he adjures them  in the name of truth  p     v   and with macbeth gives them in some sort credit for more than mortal knowledge if you can look into the seeds of time and say which grain will grow and which will not speak then to me who neither beg nor fear your favors nor your hate  p     v    this is the language of manly firmness not of contempt he does not mean to ridicule their prophecy by answering to macbeths question went it not so to the selfsame tune and words  p     v  this is a grave and precise reply to a particular and interesting demand it has been observed from the highest critical authority that malcolm confirms the serious import of the speech in question when he calls the effusions of macduffs grief and rage a manly tune  p     v   it is plain that banquos exclamation  what can the devil speak true  p     v   on hearing part of the prophecy fulfilled is dictated by wonder not disregard for when macbeth takes occasion from that very event to question him on the hope he now might reasonably entertain of his familys advancement he solemnly replies  it is strange and oftentimes to win us to our harm the instruments of darkness tell us truths win us with honest trifles to betray us in deepest consequence  p     v   now let us advert to the subsequent effect which the declarations of the sisters have upon banquos mind he prays to be delivered from their temptations  merciful powers restrain in me the cursed thoughts that nature gives way to in repose  p    v    mr stevens to whom every admirer of shakspeare must feel himself under high obligations observes upon this passage it is apparent from what banquo says afterward  to macbeth i dreamt last night of the three weird sisters  that he had been solicited in a dream to attempt something in consequence of the prophecy of the witches that his waking senses were shocked at  p     v    these horrible emotions could never have been caused in him by declarations which he had contemned ridiculed or disregarded the adventure on the heath therefore does not prove banquos spirit greater than macbeths  the remarks proceed thus in proof of macbeths personal fear of banquo his principal object is the death of the father and the securing of his crown against banquos issue who alone were pointed out to his jealousy by the witches is no more than a secondary consideration  macbeth when he confesses to lady macbeth that his mind is full of scorpions shows banquo not to be the sole cause of his uneasiness by adding thou know that banquo and his fleance lives moreover directing the assassins he tells them the sons absence is no less material to him than the fathers he urges the death of fleance on a motive distinct from cowardice for allowing one moment that he personally feared banquo it is impossible to conceive he could have felt the same dread of a boy again had his fears been personal they must have ended with the removal of the object of them but finding the son has not fallen with the father he is again involved in all his former apprehensions fleance is scapd then comes my fit again  p     v   the witches it is true only point out banquos issue to macbeths jealousy but acual is not possible progeny and the loss of one child does not prevent a man from begetting others thus the securing of his crown against banquos issue is so far from being a secondary that it is the tyrants only instigation to this double murder  the original idea of macbeths personally fearing banquo seems founded on these words  our fears in banquo stick deep  and  there is none but he whose being i do fear  p     v    it will be essentially necessary toward explaining the sense of these strong lines to follow the train of reasoning through the context of the speech from which they are taken  to be thus is nothing but to be safely thus  our fears in banquo stick deep and in his royalty of nature reigns that which would be feared it is much he dares and to that dauntless temper of his mind he has a wisdom that does guide his valor to act in safety there is none but he whose being i do fear and under him my genius is rebuked as it is said mark anthonys was by caesar he chid the sisters when first they put the name of king upon me and bade them speak to him then prophetlike they hailed him father to a line of kings upon my head they placed a fruitless crown and put a barren scepter in my gripe thence to be wrenchd with an unlineal hand no son of mine succeeding if it be so for banquos issue have i filled my mind for them the gracious duncan have i murdered put rancours in the vessel of my peace only for them and mine eternal jewel given to the common enemy of man to make them kings the seed of banquo kings rather than so come fate into the list and champion me to the utterance  ibid in this soliloquy the usurper reflects that after all he has done to obtain the crown he is in great danger of losing it weighs the causes of that danger and resolves by removing them to take effectual measures for the firmly establishing of his supremacy in other words   i have possessed myself of the sovereignty but to what avail when in a moment it may be wrested from me banquos eye is fixed upon it and there reigns in his very nature a royalty that seems to realize his expectations he is not only a soldier of uncommon bravery but so consummate a politician that should he revolt against my government he would infallibly carry his designs successfully into execution he is the only man alive whose attempts i dread and he holds as high an ascendant over my good genius as it is said caesar did over mark antonys his hopes are not only strengthened by his natural endowments but emboldened too by the assurances of prophecy hearing me saluted king by the sisters he bade them speak to him they obeyed and hailed him father to a line of kings they placed a crown upon my head and put a scepter in my hand not to be transmitted to my own but to be wrenchd away by the unlineal inheritance of his children if so i shall have perpetrated such crimes as must embitter every moment of my life in this world and forbid every hope of happiness in the world to come only to make the seed of banquo kings it must not be  i here oppose myself to the prediction and resolve by extirpating his family to elude the decrees of fate itself  the usurper then does not plunge into fresh crimes to get rid of personal fear  ambition impels him to the murder of duncan and the same ambition urges him on the destruction of banquo and fleance who seem destined to degrade him and his house from the splendors of monarchy to the obscurity of vassalage  the remarks find additional proofs of macbeths cowardice in his conduct toward macduff   the same motives of personal fear and those unmixed with any other impel him to seek the destruction of macduff  macbeth is not wrought by personal fear to destroy macduff but by the knowledge of his disaffection how say thou that macduff denies his person at our great bidding  p     v    the discontented thane of fife is a man whose parts and popularity are not to be despised he is described  noble wise judicious  p     v   and rosse speaking of the misfortune that had befallen him in the loss of his wife and children says no mind that is honest but in it shares some woe  p     v    if macbeth thanks the apparition that had harped his fears aright  it is because its caution justifying his suspicions he shall now provide more strenuously against the machinations of his enemy  if when told that  none of women born shall harm him  he says then live macduff  yet repressing the feelings of confidence instantly adds  thou shall not live that i may tell palehearted fear it lies  the quality of that fear is decided when being assured that he  shall never vanquished be until great birnam wood to high dunsinane hill shall come against him  he exclaims  our highplacd macbeth shall live the lease of nature  p     v    when the thane of fife encounters macbeth in battle the tyrant does not use the power upon his life which he believes himself possessed of as instantly he would had he feared him but yielding to compunction for the inhuman wrongs he had done him wishes to avoid the necessity of adding macduffs blood to that already spilt in the slaughter of his dearest connections  get thee back my soul is too much charged with blood of thine already  macd i have no words my voice is in my sword thou bloodier villain than terms can give thee out   fight  match thou losest labor as easy may thou the intrenchant air with thy keen sword impress as make me bleed let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests i bear a charmed life which must not yield to one of woman born   p  0  v   unmoved by macduffs taunts and furious attack macbeth advises him to employ his valor where success may follow it and generously warns him against persisting to urge an unequal combat with one whom destiny had pronounced invincible   the remarks would now condemn macbeth from his own confession of the truth of the accusations brought against him  that apprehension was his reason for these murders he intimates himself when meditating on that of banquo he observes that things bad begun make strong themselves by ill  p     a   s   and when that of macduff is in contemplation he says  i am in blood stepped in so far that should i wade no more returning were as tedious as go over  p     v    the comment on these passages which cibber puts into the mouth of king richard is remarkable and justly explains their meaning  crowns got with blood must be with blood maintained act   and when i look back it is terrible retreating i cannot bear the thought nor dare repent  act    in a word macbeth does not meditate the deaths of banquo and macduff through personal fear of them but because his ambition renders the former obnoxious to his envy and the latter to his hatred  it must now be shown that the proofs of richards superior courage are not conclusive against macbeth equal firmness in equal trials will invalidate some of them some are to be refuted by showing that what is objected to macbeth as timidity will as strongly affect richard himself and some may perhaps be founded on misappreheasion of fact or sentiment  if it is a mark of resolution in richard that when tyrrel informs him the princes are dispatched though certain of the event he is solicitous to hear at leisure in what manner it was conducted  come to me tyrrel soon at after supper when thou shall tell the process of their death  p     v    macbeth must be allowed to display precisely the same quality when he says to the murderer who has related to him the process of banquos death  get thee gone tomorrow well hear ourselves again p     v    the remarks proceed  macbeths suspicions extend to all his great lords  there is not a one of them but in his house i keep a servant feed  p     v   and  he tells the physician  the thanes fly from me  p     v   does not richard betray as much suspicion when he dares not trust stanley till he has taken the young lord strange as a surety for his fidelity  and is he not as anxious from a mere doubt of his followers as macbeth is on finding himself really deserted k rich o ratcliff i have dreamed a fearful dream  what think thou  will our friends prove all true   rat no doubt my lord  k rich i fear i fear    come go with me under our tents i will play the eavesdropper to hear if any mean to shrink from me  p     v    mr w says his going round the camp just before the battle to listen if any meant to shrink from him is proper on that particular occasion  agreed  but why think the same action proper conduct in richard and cowardice in macbeth   the remarks bent upon exalting richard at macbeths expense say the same determined spirit carries him through the bloody business of murdering his nephews and when buckingham shows a reluctance to be concerned in it he immediately looks out for another  had macbeth been thus disappointed in the person to whom he had opened himself it would have disconcerted any design he had formed  it appears however that the persons macbeth opened himself to were not wrought to his purpose on their first interview yet it does not disconcert his designs he sends for them again repeats his former conversation and prevails with them by strong arguments and large promises to undertake a murder the execution whereof he steadily persists in p     v    again all the crimes richard commits are for his advancement not for his security  richard removes clarence and hastings as macbeth does duncan for his advancement but he murders his nephews and his wife as macbeth does banquo to secure himself in that advancement  why should it be supposed macbeth catches the terrors he sees expressed in the countenance of the messenger who informs him of numbers of the enemy ser there is ten thousand   match geese villain  ser soldiers sir  match go prick thy face and overred thy fear thou lilyliverd boy what soldiers patch death of thy soul those linen cheeks of thine are counselors to fear   p     v    from the contemptuous manner in which he treats the intelligence he seems rather to imagine what effect such looks might have upon the garrison than to acknowledge any they have produced upon himself  what is richards composure in a similar situation the information he receives of insurrections in devonshire and kent being followed by news of buckinghams army striking the messenger he exclaims out on ye owls  nothing but songs of death there take thou that  p     v   macbeths courage is impeached because he calls for his armor notwithstanding seytons remonstrance that it is not needed yet  persists in putting it on calls for it again eagerly afterward bids the person who is assisting him dispatch  then the moment it is on pulls it off again and directs his attendants to bring it after  p     v    is there more confusion and inconsistency in this than in the following scene rat most mighty sovereign on the western coast rides a puissant navy to the shore throng many doubtful hollowhearted friends unarmed and unresolved to beat them back it is thought that richmond is their admiral and there they hull expecting but the aid of buckingham to welcome them ashore  k rich some lightfoot friend post to the duke of norfolk  ratcliff thyself  or catesby  where is he  cates here my good lord  k rich catesby fly to the duke   cates i will my lord with all convenient haste  k rich ratcliffe come hither post to salisbury when thou come thither  dull unmindful villain to catesby why stayst thou here and go not to the duke  cates first mighty liege tell me your highness pleasure what from your grace i shall deliver to him  k rich o true good catesby  bid him levy straight the greatest strength and power he can make and meet me suddenly at salisbury  cates i go  rat what may it please you shall i do at salisbury  k rich why what would thou do there before i go  rat your highness told me i should post before  k rich my mind is changed    p     v    arguing principally from the recited instances of it the remarks say these are all symptoms of timidity which he confesses to have been natural to him when he owns that the time has been my senses would have cooled to hear a nightshriek and my fell of hair would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir as life were in it  i have supt full of horrors direness familiar to my slaughtrous thoughts cannot once start me  p     v    here mr w refutes his own position for if his interpretation of these lines be admitted he must allow that macbeth whatever his former feelings were has no timidity in his disposition now but the passage refers neither to fear or courage  it is a pathetic reflection on the dreadful change produced in his humane habits during a seventeen years usurpation the records whereof are crowded with practices so oppressive and bloody as have hardened his once easily yielding temper against all impressions of sensibility and the charities of nature  p    when richard  asks my lord of surry why look you so sad  p     v   and afterward  enquires saw thou the melancholy lord northumberland p     v   he is not satisfied upon being told that he and surry were busied in chearing up the foldiers  he would indeed fain persuade himself to be satisfied but in reality he is far from being at ease i am satisfied  give me a bowl of wine i have not the alacrity of spirit nor cheer of mind that i was will not to have  p     v   the nature of richards question on surrys sadness and observation of northumberlands melancholy may be exemplified from mr ws judicious reflection on macbeths interrogatories to the physician  can thou not minister to a mind diseased pluck from the memory etc etc  p     v   though it is the disorder of lady macbeth that gives occasion to these questions yet  in his own mind he is all the while making application to himself richard represents the enemy as a troop of banditti a sort of vagabonds rascals and runaways a scum of britains and base lackey peasants etc p     v    this harangue to his army should not have been quoted as an instance of richards intrepidity for it does not contain his real sentiments of richmonds friends the inferiority of the foe is a topic which generals to encourage their own troops have commonly affected and richard never could have seriously held in contempt such enemies as sir walter herbert a renowned soldier sir gilbert talbot and sir william stanley oxford redoubted pembroke sir james blunt and rice ap thomas with a valiant crew and many others of great name and worth  p     v    when lady macbeth finding her husband will proceed no further in the bloody business of his sovereigns death reproaches him thus  would thou have that which thou esteemst the ornament of life and live a coward in thine own esteem letting i dare not wait upon i would   p     v   his reply i dare do all that may become a man  is so far being an assertion of mere manliness of character in mr ws sense that it sublimely expresses an entire contempt of danger and reverence for virtue  to compare macbeth and richard under the influence of visions  macbeth addresses banquo thus why what care i if thou can nod speak too if charnelhouses and our graves must send those that we bury back our monuments shall be the maws of kites  p     v    again what man dare i dare approach thou like the rugged russian bear the armed rhinoceros or the hyrcan tiger take any shape but that and my firm nerves shall never tremble or be alive again and dare me to the desert with thy sword if trembling i inhabit then protest me the baby of a girl hence horrible shadow unreal mockery hence  p     v   notwithstanding the firmness of this defiance it cannot be supposed but macbeth is as much terrified while he utters it as richard is when starting out of a dream in which the souls of those he had murdered had appeared to him he cries have mercy jesu  soft i did but dream  o coward conscience how do thou afflict me the lights burn blue  is it not dead midnight cold fearful drops stand on my trembling flesh etc p     v    superstition may be a sign of timidity  macbeths superstition is founded on the strong assurances of preternatural agents whose first promises to him had been made good  richard condescends to be affected by omens richmond  when i was last at exeter the mayor in courtsy showed me the castle and called it rougemnt at which name i started because a bard of ireland told me once i should not live long after i saw richmond  p     v   again the sun will not be seen today the sky does frown and lour upon our army i would these dewy tears were from the ground  p     v   it will be said and it will be granted that richard presently stifles these emotions it is only asserted that he feels them like macbeth and that macbeth like him can overcome them  the wood of birnam moves toward dunsinane  the tyrant doubts the equivocation of the fiend  and believing the laws of nature invented to his ruin pulls in resolution  instantly however he shakes off this momentary dismay  blow wind come wrack at least well die with our harness on our back  p  0  v   he rushes upon the enemy  encounters macduff  the sisters have palterd with him he has done with belief in the juggling fiends and can rely upon himself  though birnam wood be come to dunfinane and thou opposed being of no woman born yet i will try thy last before my body i throw my warlike shield lay on macduff and damned be him that first cries hold enough p  0  v   this conduct in macbeth is stigmatized with the name of despair  it certainly is of the same nature with richards determination  i have set my life upon a cast and i will stand the hazard of the die  p     v   the resolution of both tyrants in the battles that decided their fate is that mixed effusion of grief shame and pride which cannot be denominated less than the despair of innate bravery  if macbeths behavior is to be called cowardly when overpowered by the completion of the prophecies he for a moment declines the combat with macduff so must richards when he flies with hastings before warwick and somerset leaving edward to the mercy of the lancastrians  p    v    from the review of the characters of the usurpers it appears not to be true of richard that upon no occasion however tremendous end at no moment of his life however unguarded does he betray the least symptom of fear  or of macbeth that he is always shaken upon great and frequently upon trivial occasions  macbeth and richard are each of them as intrepid as man can be yet it may be said of each without any derogation from that character that he is at times agitated with apprehensions the earl of peterborough has left it upon record that intrepidity and sense of danger are by no means incompatible  having endeavored to prove that macbeth has a just right to the reputation of intrepidity that he feels no personal dread of banquo and macduff and that he meets equal not to say superior trials as boldly as richard it may be expected this essay should attempt to show in what the essential difference between these great bad men consists  ambition is the impulse that governs every action of richards life he attains the crown by dissimulation that owns no respect for virtue and by cruelty which entails no remorse on the vaour that would maintain his illacquird dignity ambition is the predominant vice of macbeths nature but he gratifies it by hypocrisy that reveres virtue too highly to be perfectly itself and by murders the recollection whereof at times renders his valor useless by depriving him of all fense but that of his enormous wickedness richards character is simple macbeths mixed richard is only intrepid macbeth intrepid and feeling richards mind not being diverted by reflection from the exigencies of his situation he is always at full leisure to display his valor macbeth distracted by remorse loses all apprehension of danger in the contemplation of his guilt and never recurs to his valor for support till the enemys approach rouzes his whole soul and conscience is repelled by the necessity for exertion  the writer of the above pages cannot conclude without saying he read the remarks on some of shakspeares characters with so much general pleasure and conviction that he wishes his approbation were considerable enough to increase the celebrity which mr wheatleys memory has acquired from a work so usefully intended and so elegantly performed
