the black art detected and exposed or a demonstration of the hellish impiety of being or desiring to be a wizzard conjurer or witch  and of the horrid wickedness of them that have recourse to those who are such or are supposed to be so to seek relief from them in any case whatever  together with remarks upon the causes of this impiety  in a letter to a country gentleman  let conjurers

green dragon in st pauls churchyard   0   the black art detected and exposed or the hellish impiety of it in a letter etc i dear cousin your candor will pardon a bigger fault in me than any i hope i shall be ever willing to commit against the rules and laws of friendship and honor  it is my giving you the trouble of reading a long letter that i now beg your excuse for  the necessity of sending it to you meeting with your generous civility your christian temper and endearing sweetness of disposition will be a full delery of all the guilt i can be supposed to have contracted by its length  my house having been lately broken at midnight my being bound hand and foot and my servants too and robbed has raised variety of reports in the country  some basely reporting that i would easily get my plate money and goods again meaning by intimations which they give by conjuration or by exercising that black and accursed art of dealing with them that have familiar spirits  and to confirm the probability of their supposition they do not stick to say that that was the reason why i was so cheerful and easy during the robbery and talked so freely with the robbers and the reason too why i have been so ever since  nay some have not sailed to endeavor to put about a report that my money goods and plate were brought back to me again  others perhaps innocently having that notion of learning that they thought it might be done by that  all that i have hitherto said in my defense is this that i would not do it to save my life to gain the universe or ten thousand worlds  my dear cousin the care that i ought to have of your soul as my parishioner as well as my relation and my friend makes me willing to speak to you a little more affectionately and tenderly and closely upon this point and to set you right in it  consider with me a little that place levit xx  the soul that turns after such as have familiar spirits and after wizzards to go a whoring after them i will even set my face against that soul and will cut him off from among this people  now though i can by divine aid meekly sweetly and temperately bear the defamation and reproach as far as concerns my self rejoicing in the mark and character of my master relying on his cross having it in my view to sweeten my affliction to calm my passions to break my own will to beat down selflove and to draw from that fountain such grace as is necessary to lead a christian that is a crucified life yet because the honor of god the honor of the church the safety of many souls who may be misled by the supposed example are concerned i shall not only demonstrate to you the detestation and abhorrence i have of this matter but endeavor upon this occasion to rectify a great mistake in the world  ii and i shall plead the cause of god labor to destroy the works of the devil which was the great business of the holy jesus into the world   st john iii  to discover this great delusion and cheat of souls that endangers often their everlasting interest that draws them off from their allegiance to god deserves a forfeiture of his favor and protection and puts them into a correspondence and commerce with the devil i mean the being or desiring to be a wizzard or the seeking to them that are and that in any case whatever  against this the place mentioned levit xx  and many more as you shall presently see is one would think a dreadful dissuasive the soul that etc  by wizzards are meant those that use any conjurations or witchcrafts by compact correspondence commerce confederacy or familiarity with the devil or any evil spirit of his kingdom  a thing which those that expect a heavenly kingdom from their father which is in heaven should tremble to think of or so much as once desire to put in practice  we that belong to another world we that call christ our lord we that pray his kingdom may come we that renounced the devil and his accursed spirits in our baptism we that have been sanctified by the holy spirit of god we that have been sealed by it to the day of redemption ephesians iv 0 we whose conversation or citizenship or freedom is in heaven that we should act contrary or consent to a desire to act contrary to all this by applying our selves to the accursed spirits of darkness or their agents this is dismal this is deplorable and deserves to be lamented with tears of blood  i shall therefore once for all set this in a true light before you by the assistance of that holy spirit of god which is contrary to the kingdom and the spirits of darkness  and when you once see the horrible impiety of being or desiring to be a wizzard conjurer or witch or of being engaged in any confederacy league familiarity or compact with the devil and withal have a clear and tender view of and in a close and piercing thought consider the great wickedness too of seeking to them whom you suppose to be such in any case whatever i know you will start back and with a pious trembling not only desire to say with our lord get thee behind me satan but with st peter too presently turn the stream of your thoughts and passions another way and as a proper cure of all such tendencies say quickly with him lord thou know that i love thee  iii that you may do this the more effectually and tenderly i must recommend to your deepest thoughts these five or six things    i shall desire you to consider with a trembling spirit the threatenings and consequently the hatred of the holy god against it i mean not only of being or desiring to be a wizzard but of seeking and applying to them that are supposed to be such    how severely he has punished it    consider it is in some measure to desert and disown the sovereignty of god and advance the dominion of the kingdom of darkness    it is a going contrary to our baptismal vow and covenant    it is in a great degree the casting off the protection and doubting of the care and providence of the holy god and of a tender father in hopes to find a better friend in the devil    it is to choose iniquity rather than affliction these are things that strike horror in the very mentioning of them and certainly an impiety that has all these dismal aggravations and dangers in it should be abhorred shunned and trembled at beyond the standing on the brink of a rock or before the mouth of a cannon ready to be discharged  iv consider first the threatenings and consequently the hatred of the holy god against it this appears not only in the place before quoted levit xx  but in the last verse of this chapter  lev xx   a man or woman that has a familiar spirit or that is a wizzard shall surely be put to death they shall stone them with stones their blood shall be upon them  thus levit xix   regard not them that have familiar spirits neither seek after wizzards to be defiled by them i am the lord your god  neither seek after them it seems the very seeking after them is to be defiled by them  and shall the holy and eternal god look down from the mansions of glory and see his sovereignty protection and care of you cast off slighted and disregarded by you or not humbly and with resignation depended on in the use of lawful just and prudent means  shall he from whom you expect so much as you do see you seeking to wizzards and defiled by them  shall he see you casting off his dominion and providence who like a tender father has so long taken care for you and promised to do it all along and to bear your charges home to the end of your journey yet because of some affliction which he designs for wise and good and merciful ends to you you will now consent to the deserting him and turn away and seek to the accursed spirits of darkness and to wizzards who are correspondents with them and consent to be defiled by them  would you have this said of you charged upon you remembered of you at the resurrection with a depart from me i know you not  yet how justly may he say this to you who thus departed first from him  nor should you ever cease tenderly to consider that the consulting wizzards and them that have familiar spirits is called an abomination to the lord deuteronomy xviii       and how unlikely is it that the come  blessed children of my father should be said to those who are an abomination to him  v consider with me next how severely he has punished this  it cost saul his life though a king   chronicles x   so saul died for his transgression which he committed against the lord and also for asking counsel of one that had a familiar spirit to enquire of it and enquired not of the lord therefore he slew him  and if he slew him though a king so consulting wizzards them that had familiar spirits i need not stay to ask how justly the same actions may draw down the same vengeance  and if not the same vengeance in this lower world then without a deep and tender repentance and an unfeigned return to god that vengeance which st jude speaks of which is infinitely more to be feared than a present temporal death i mean the vengeance of eternal life jude    to this instance i might add the dismal case of manass another king who so provoked the lord to anger by the same abomination   kings xxi  by dealing with familiar spirits and wizzards that he drew down judgments on himself and his kingdom  kings themselves having been thus severely punished for seeking and applying to those who had familiar spirits the same impiety in you would not only deserve the same but severer and worse judgments  for with a grateful soft and affectionate heart consider you have had a clearer revelation and have had life and immortality brought to light by the coming of the holy jesus   timothy i 0  and shall we who more pretend to be led by the spirit of god turn away from him to be led by them that consult with familiar spirits and the accursed spirits of darkness  and to make it a heap and conjugation of many impieties together not only cast off the divine protection disrespect the good providence of your god tacitly blame his conduct refuse submission to his wisdom and his will in afflictions not only turning away from the spirit to the spirits of darkness not cheerfully acquiescing in his aids directions and consolations not only departing from him whom we would not have to say to us depart from me in the day of judgment but also to complete the wickedness all this to proceed from pride  vainglory or malice or envy impatience or immortification of spirit covetousness or discontent and want of dependence on and resignation to god in the use of just and lawful means  what a heap and knot of impieties are here bound up in the prosecution of one enough to sink a disconsolate soul to the sorrows of eternity  vi that it is in some measure to desert and disown the sovereignty of god and advance the kingdom of darkness i have before hinted  but then if we will thus cast off and despise and grow weary of the providential care and protection of god weary of our dependence on him and resignation to him and will run for help and aid relief and cure and satisfaction and knowledge to the devil and his accursed spirits if instead of submitting to his will and to his wisdom in afflictions in the sole use of lawful rational natural and prudent means we run to thse what is this but to suppose that his enemy and ours will be kinder to us than our god  whereas we never enough consider never with a thought deep and close and piercing enough that our god has kind and wise and good ends in afflictions and merciful designs and the devil nothing but evil ends and damning designs upon us if he do remove them nor can he do that without the permission and leave of our god and father  and then what a phrenzy and height of folly as well as wickedness and impiety is it either to hope or but to consent to try whether the devil will be a better friend to us than our god  it is true indeed in losses diseases and other afflictions we may and ought as i have hinted to use rational and prudent pious and diligent just and discreet means and care for our satisfaction  ease of them  and sometimes god thinks fit to direct us to the right and sometimes he does  sometimes he thinks fit to bless the leans and sometimes he does not  but whether he does or does not direct  to and bless and succeed the means  our relief or ease satisfaction or ure still he has wise and good and fatherly and tender and compassionate  and ends in it  but in recourse and going to wizzards and accursed spirits the devil has none but ill ends and horrid designs in the relief and successes that he gives if he gives any and if possible for each kindness he does would have a soul to damnation  so that the very afflictions of our god are ten thousand times more choosable than any relief we can have of them from wizzards or those accursed people that treat or are in league with the spirits of darkness  nor can the devil or his agents afflict us without gods permission or without that relieve or ease or direct any to any part of assistance knowledge or information  and if god in judgment permit this permit i mean some to be seduced and to confide in and rely upon the devil and his agents and to cast off his sovereignty providence and protection such are within an ace of his clutches and everlasting damnation  so infinitely are afflictions and chastisements from a tender father to be preferred before any relief or satisfaction or ease from the devil or his  our god having nothing but wise and good ends when he assists and the devil nothing but dreadful and accursed designs when he relieves or informs or aids or eases if he do it at all nor can he do it at all without the divine permission  which alone were enough to make you ashamed and start and tremble at the phrenzy the danger the imprudence of having any recourse to wizzards and their accursed agents in any case whatever  vii there is another dreadful impiety in it never sufficiently considered or laid to heart by the world which no person that has been concerned in it can reflect on with an unbroken heart and an unrelenting spirit that it is a going contrary to our baptismal vow and covenant that sacred vow we all made when we were mercifully received into the family of our savior received into his church kindly admitted into his kingdom of grace in order to his kingdom of glory that sacred covenant we entered into with god when we took our first step for heaven  then we renounced the devil and all works of his all correspondence with and recourse to all dealing and commerce with him or his imps and agents  and if we solemnly renounced him then shall we make a covenant or correspond or deal with him now or treacherously side or join with them that do  we that promised to fight manfully under the banner of our god and savior shall we desert him now now when we can consider how much he tenders us or how little and how shameless a thing it would be to expect heaven at a cheaper rate than one poor short life of loyalty obedience and love to him  we that then promised to continue his faithful soldiers and servants to our lives end shall we now throw down hi easy yoke and light burden when it does begin to pinch a little shall we cast down his cross when our faith and love is a little tried and take part with his and our grand and implacable enemy so implacable as never to be content and satisfied without our eternal ruin and everlasting damnation  and if you will thus desert your god consider what harm has he done you that you should leave him it may be he has afflicted you and you hope the devil will relieve you but i have answered this already he afflicts for loving ends the devil when he can relieve does it only for damning ends nor can he relieve or help without gods permission  the afflictions of a wise and good father are mercifully intended and in due time with our rational and prudent means and prayers to him he will remove them  or if he do not remove them it is only because it is best for us not to have them removed and then i would only ask this question if god think fit to take any thing from us is it fit we should desire to keep it  viii and now give me leave to ask again you that renounced the devil and all works and agents of his when you were kindly and mercifully and most endearingly admitted into the family of your savior before you knew it or could beg it and before so many thousands of the world who never had that happiness will you now close with him whom you then renounced will you treat with him will you covenant with him will you consent with him will you join  any way take part with him or with them that do all this only because you would remove an affliction which a tender father kindly sent and can remove and which the devil cannot remove without his leave and if he do give leave it is to your infinite and eternal danger  and after all it is but what your god will remove himself when the time comes that he sees it is best for you and he will then direct you to the proper and the best means and will hear your prayers and bless your endeavors and applications  nay when that time comes in which he sees it best for you he will answer your desires and relieve and ease you without means or make it up some other way  come good sir turn all this inward and with a soft and melting a tender and relenting spirit enquire  why o why my soul shall we desert such a father what injury has he done us  the least kindness the devil does us or seems to do for us he would have our damnation for it the least affliction our father gives us he means the promoting our salvation by it  the least aid or ease the devil gives he gives it in expectation of a soul down to the howlings of the damned the least affliction our god gives us or permits to be given us he does it in expectation and desire of fitting us for heaven by it  the least kindness the devil or his agents does for any it gives him a better title to a soul the least affliction a tender father gives it is either to awaken a soul or rouse it or hedge in its way to him or to make it cry after him as a child does when a father hides his face a little or for other wise and good and holy ends  and would you apply your self to the accursed spirits or their agents and desert such a father  i ask again what unkindness has he done you what injury has he done you for when all is done his kindnesses and mercies are a thousand times more than his afflictions and his afflictions nothing but kindness  ix another dreadful aggravation of the being or desiring to be a wizzard conjurer or witch or seeking to them that are is this it is in a great degree a casting off the protection and the providence of god  and would you do an action by which you should tacitly deny or despise his providence  do you think he has forgot or neglects to govern the world because some things do not go as you would have them or because he permits some uneasy things to befall you  do you imagine that he that takes care of sparrows so that not one of them shall fall to the ground without him that numbers the very hairs of your head that he takes no care of the world or has cast off the government of it or that he has wholly left it to the devil  or are you willing he should leave it to the devil and his agents because you are willing to go to them for help and remedy for relief or ease who as i have said can do nothing without gods leave and for every thing they do would damn a soul  or if you do own his protection and providence and wisdom yet are you willing to cast it off and think the devils would be better  or are you willing to trust him farther than your god  these are questions and inquiries that should be enough to melt and break the most hard and stoniest heart in the world  what has the devil done for you and what has your god left undone who sent his son to die for that soul that the devil would cheat you of and who sends an affliction to make you still the more careful of that soul and the devil would remove it only to be able to torment it for ever  x and now if you please even trust your implacable enemy farther than a compassionate father put your self under his care and protection seek to him for direction assistance and aid join and covenant with him or with them that do if you can think him your better friend or if he have done more for your soul and body or if you think he means so well by removing an affliction as your god does by giving it when what is still to be remembered he cannot remove it without gods leave and god will remove it himself when he sees it best for you and till he sees it best it is best it should be as it is  god as i before said has not given up or left the government of the world he neither slumbers nor sleeps his eyes are in every place beholding the evil and the good prove xv   nay more than that shall there be evil in a city and the lord has not done it amos iii   you are to consider there is the evil of sin and the evil of suffering  the evil of sin he is of purer eyes than to behold he abominates it the evil of sin is done not by his positive will but by his permissive will he often permits it otherwise there could be no such things as virtue and vice rewards and punishments  but the evil of suffering or the evil of affliction directly comes from him that is he either directly sends it or permits it to befall us by the hands or tongues of others and in this he has always infinitely wise and merciful and good and kind ends to us which he clearly sees though we see them not  he has tender and compassionate designs in them while we murmur at them and while we impatiently complain and would fain go to the devil and his accursed agents to cross those wise and good and compassionate designs and ends of god in them  but can you tell what these wise and good ends are  yes i can i can tell you many of them and he has a thousand more and yet even but one of these i shall mention is sufficient so far to recommend them to us as to make us kiss the rod and to look up to him with love and resignation and to be thankful for them  xi it is in mercy and with infinitely kind designs he permits us to be sometimes afflicted whether it be by men or in other cases and seldom without one or all of these gracious ends    it may be and often is to wean us from the world   to try our patience and resignation to his will   to reform something he sees amiss in us or to bring us to repentance   to hedge in our way to him though it be with thorns   to try whether we will love him as well when his hand lies hard upon us as when it does not   to smite here that he may spare hereafter   to try whether by our stedfastness we can be content that heaven and his love or his obedience should cost us something these are some and he sees more  let us give each of these a short and tender view and then besides the horrid impiety of seeking to the devil or his agents to remove an affliction so well so kindly meant to us by god we should see reason to adore and thank him for it and much rather cross the impatience of our spirit by a thankful resignation than cross his merciful designs in it and that by the most dreadful wickedness too    he sometimes bestows an affliction on us to wean us from the world  it may be he sees us set our hearts too much on something of this lower world though we see it not and he does not think it safe for us to do so  when he sees us thus to stick too close to it he sends a disappointment to raise our affections there where enemies and disappointments shall never enter    he sometimes does it for a kind trial of our patience and resignation  you would fain choose what part you shall act here not considering enough that your god can choose better for you than you can for your self let him therefore dispense as he pleases who is the great master of the world and perhaps he would this way try to bring you to say with humble love if this please god let it be as it is    at other times he lets an affliction fall gently on us to bring us to repentance and to reform something he sees amiss in us though we see it not our selves  and would we have a tender father let us run on to the sorrows of eternity without restraint or check or care or notice it may be he sees us about to turn out of the road to a lovely immortality and he would kindly strike us in again this was the case of david psalm cxix   before i was afflicted i went astray but now have kept thy word    he sometimes sends it to hedge in our way to him though with thorns less than this or other suchlike methods would not perhaps serve the turn and he sees it necessary to chide us into resignation or some other duty    or it may be he lets down an affliction upon us to try whether we will love him as well when his hand lies hard upon us as when it does not  and when job in this respect was tried he was found faithful he could as easily bless and thank and adore and love him when he took away as when he gave job i    and you your self never sufficiently considered how unreasonable it is to be troubled that you have not one thing that you need not when your love and thankfulness to god should be greater for having received all you need    or if he please to send an affliction to smite here that he may spare hereafter this is the greatest kindness in the world it is to bring thee to judge thy self that thou may not be judged and you will fly in the face of the physician because his physic is unpleasant to the taste  and if he has a mind to choose thee from the furnace of affliction isai xlviii 0 do not choose the sorrows of eternity by crossing his merciful designs in going to a wizzard to seek thus to remove the kind affliction    and then seventhly and lastly if he sometimes sends us an affliction to exercise our passive graces and to try whether we can be content that his obedience and his love should cost us something this puts an opportunity into our hands to thank him that he has given us any thing that we can lose for him and above all to consider that whatever we may lose for him we shall never lose by him and therefore we can never lose too much for god  xii these are some and your god has a thousand more good ends in sending thee an affliction  o that instead of crossing these merciful ends of god and that by horridly unlawful means we would humbly answer the compassionate designs and bless and thank him for the means  but alas instead of this you will have recourse to the devil and his accursed spirits and agents to remove that affliction which you should thankfully receive and piously improve  if the devil or his agents do or can relieve you as he expects the damnation of your soul for the kindness so your god would in due time when it comes to be best do it for you and before that time does come knows it best for you it should be as it is but by that time he will direct thee to the means and bless them or if that time should never come in this lower world and we should never see the means for removing an affliction best it is then certain he designs a better time for it and till that comes it is best not to have them blessed as yet  and now desert such a father if you can when he only sends afflictions for your good have recourse to the devil or his agents if you can who only would remove them to  and ascertain your damnation nor can he do that without your fathers leave  and are you willing god should give him leave to ease you at the expense of your soul are you content god should give him leave to be your physician at the hazard of your eternal damnation or to be your assistant director and your informer in any thing here that you may be guided and directed by him home to the sorrows of eternity  rather start back and tremble at but the thoughts of this and whatever the loss or the temptation or the affliction be do but trust your god a little while longer and it is but a little while you will be able to trust him it is but a little while you will be able to show that you can trust him and you will shortly see a satisfying and unexpected issue in one or in both worlds  xiii it is another aggravation of this dreadful impiety of having recourse to wizzards conjurers and witches and treating and dealing with them for direction help or ease in any calamity that it is to choose iniquity rather than affliction  against this we are cautioned in holy job him who could bless god as well when he took away as when he gave job xxxvi   take heed regard not iniquity for this thou have chosen rather than affliction  and would you have this remembered of you when the archangels trump shall sound and that sound shall mingle with the crack and the noise of the dissolving world  would you have this remembered of you now and recounted among the wisest and best beings of the upper lovely world where there is joy over one sinner that repents that you would choose the iniquity of deserting your god rather than an affliction though kindly meant to you and mercifully designed and intended that you would rather choose the horrible iniquity of having recourse to the accursed spirits of darkness to be eased of an affliction which if they can or do ease you of expect the damnation of your soul in return when all the while as i must again say your god would have eased it in the use of prayer diligence and lawful means in a little time or if not sees it best for you not to have it eased as yet and till his time comes it is not fit you should desire it should be in yours  would you really accept of a deliverance from the devil or his accursed agents upon these terms ah no you know your fathers in christianity and the patriarchs would not accept of a deliverance from the afflictions cast on them by men or devils that they might obtain a better resurrection heb xi    they would not accept of a deliverance though a lawful one and would you accept of an unlawful and accursed one would you accept of a deliverance from the wretched spirits of darkness who can give you none without gods permission and who for this deliverance expect and desire no less than your soul down to those torments from whence there is no deliverance  xiv and now let us look back again a little to that place of levit xx  and let us there observe one thing more  they that are or desire to be wizzards or seek to them i will even set my face against that soul says the holy god  and very justly when you first set your face against him fly in his face for mercifully and kindly correcting you fly in his face for giving you a thousand good things and a thousand better promises and gives you but one affliction or two and that too in tenderness love and mercy  no wonder therefore he has been pleased to say i will set my face against that soul you first setting yours against him deserting him running from him to his enemies disowning his sovereignty protection care and providence going contrary to your baptismal vow and promise to him advancing the kingdom of darkness which his son the holy jesus came to destroy acting directly contrary to one great end and design of his coming into the world and all this but to repair a loss regain an ease or remove an affliction which without gods leave he has no power to do and which god sent to a good and merciful end and when that end is answered will remove it which till he sees best to do it is not best for you to desire  and now if you will fly in his face for this go consider and see who first set his face against the other your god against you or you against your god  and then the only question i have to ask upon this head is when is it that you could be content to have him set his face against you  i will mention but four sorts of times and days which will come upon you and would you have it set against you in either of these    would you have him set his face against you in the day of affliction   or in the days of prosperity   or in the hour of death   or in the day of judgment xv would you be content to have your god set his face against you in the day of affliction  this day and hour awakes every one of us and nothing will sweeten or alleviate an affliction so truly and so much as the secret inward joyous apprehensions that they come from a tender father whose wisdom and goodness has merciful designs and ends in them though we see them not the sweet illapses of the divine love with them will make them supportable and easy  but how intolerable must an affliction be how heavy the load and how insupportable the pressure when it comes with the face of the lord set against us too with just apprehensions of his wrath and anger  this must be a little image of hell on earth a little kind of foretaste of the sorrows of eternity an image and little resemblance of that state where their worm dies not and their fire is not quenched  if in this day and hour of affliction it be thus insupportable to have his face set against thee consider now how just it is it should be so when you first desert him set your face against him reject or cast off his protection and his providence will not stay for his wisdom and his time and his goodness to relieve and ease you in his blessing of prudent just and lawful means but will look upon the devil and his accursed spirits as your better friends and give your self up to be assisted or relieved eased or directed by them or their wretched agents  xvi and as little certainly would you have him set his face against you or lie under the just apprehension of his displeasure and his wrath in the days of prosperity  without the sweet illapses of the divine love and the rational wellgrounded hopes of the care protection and favor of our god and of the living in a state acceptable to him there can be no such thing as prosperity in this life  the stings and gnawings the dissatisfactions and uneasiness of a guilty breast will sour and imbitter all enjoyments of the world mix gall and wormwood with them  the true sedateness serenity and tranquillity of mind is only the result of those consolations which the holy spirit of god gives upon an undissembled purity probity and sanctity of life  the sweet emotions the delicious relishes and the holy joy which these raise in and leave upon the soul are such as no enemy can reach or meddle with which men or devils cannot take from us  and will you part with these emotions relishes and joys and give them up to him and his accursed spirits only to be eased of an affliction sent you by a tender father to wise and good and kind ends  would you think it a greater kindness from the devil to remove it than twas in god to send it when he cannot remove it neither as i have often said without the leave of your god  will you trust him farther than you will trust your god and think that he will do more for you than your god that god who has given you a thousand mercies for one affliction and yet for that one affliction you will desert and leave him and forget all his other mercies  let not this be said or remembered of you at the resurrection when the crowns and palms of eternity come to be disposed of  xvii nor would you have the face of god set against you sure when the cold sweat shall sit upon your brows and your mourning relations shall stand round your bedside and come and take their last leave of you when nothing shall be so welcome to you as a prayer book no company like a guide of souls no employment but devotion and you shall stand upon the threshold of a newworld by that time you would not surely have the face of him set against you from whom you will infinitely desire the approbation of welldone good etc and from whom you would desire the character of moses beyond all the treasures of the indies joshua i  moses my servant is dead  and if you would not then have the face of him set against you from whose mouth you would in that day and hour pant and sigh and languish for this approbation o why will you set your face against him now trust his enemies farther than him now have recourse to them and desert him now join with them against him and expect relief or ease direction or assistance from them rather than from him  and i doubt not but you will say you would least of all have him set his face against you in the day of judgment  when the archangels trump shall summon the trembling world to appear before the throne of god and to come and take their last sentence and consignation to their eternal state the devil whom you have recourse to now will be then your grand accuser  he whom you trust so far now for relief or direction will lie hard and bitterly against you then and be your implacable witness and that even for this too  he to whom you go for help now will then very bitterly plead this against you that you did so then you will need an advocate to answer his objections and this advocate you will desert and provoke now and draw him to set his face against you hoping by seeking to the devil in need that he would be kinder to you than your god  how should but the bare mention of such things as these set the guilty soul a trembling and make it appear evil and bitter to him thus to have forsaken the lord in any degrees or measures jer ii    come rather accuse your self and prevent the grand accuser and humbly and with resignation of soul trust him now on whom alone you are to trust in the hour of death and the day of judgment  but tremble ever at the thoughts of trusting him for any the least relief direction or ease who for one affliction removed if he can and do remove it expects and desires you should bear the afflictions of eternity  xviii the causes of this impiety if in the last place you would consider deeply and tenderly with a close and piercing thought the reasons of mens giving way to this impiety of being or desiring to be a wizzard or conjurer or seeking to them that are this will make it appear more tremendous and shameful yet  and usually it is one or all of these seven    pride or vainglory   discontent   malice revenge and envy   covetousness or an eager love of the world   impatience and immortification of spirit   distrust of the divine providence   want of love to god in submission his will and to his wisdom and no wonder if such dismal causes produce so bad effects    pride or vainglory  a desire of being thought something in learning or knowledge above others no doubt has given the devil very often a  occasion  he himself is a proud spirit and he is willing to cherish that assimilating vice in any it threw him out of heaven and he would willingly have it throw others thence too whereas the first virtue of our lords sermon to countermine him was humility blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven  but what a dreadfully mistaken excellency is this to be proud of to have the favor correspondence assistance and guidance of the accursed spirits of darkness at the expense of his favor in which there is life psalm  0 and who has said learn of me for i am meek and lowly in heart    a second cause of this impiety is discontent  an uneasy and unreasonable sin  a tender father for a thousand mercies gives us and sees it necessary to give us one affltion and we will fly in his face because he does and run to the devil for help in hopes he will be kinder to us whereas for the removal of one affliction he would bring upon us a thousand miseries for a thousand ages  while our god gives us a thousand blessings and sends us an affliction to bring us the safer home to ten thousand more  xix another cause of this horrid impiety is malice or revenge and envy spite and a bitter spirit  this pleases the grand enemy of mankind extremely likens our spirit to his own and predisposes us and gives him advantage  it is indeed a temper so agreeable to his haughty implacable and malicious disposition as brings some pretty near to him before they have recourse to wizzards and seek to them and it pleases him the more because it is a disposition so contrary to the prince of peace and the god of love  and if he can boil up the bitter spirit high enough to fit it to be deserted by the spirit of god he will soon show it ways if he be thus permitted to revenge an enemy  and then he has a double ty upon them not only by the vices of malice envy and revenge which are so contrary to heaven and the temper that reigns in the element of love but he gains by them a dependence upon him to assist them in doing mischief and to oblige that malice  it is true blessed be god he does not permit this often yet he sometimes does as he did in the case of job  but then if he do permit this a little permit i mean the devil or his agents to afflict men he always gives those that look up to him and depend on him and desert him not either a way to escape or something better than that would have been  and while i am speaking of revenge and malice and of the eager sowerness of an impotent restless and bitter spirit as one great motive and fitness and predisposition to be or to desire to be a wizzard or to be seeking to them that are let me observe one thing the difference between the spirit of these wretches and the spirit of a christian  the malicious agents of the devil sleep not prove iv   except they have done mischief and their sleep is taken away unless they cause some to fall  but the spirit of a christian not only sleeps sweetly but gains ground for heaven by his enemys bitterness his enemys putting himself back in his accounts for eternity gives him an occasion of adding some jewels more to his crown of glory and he the good man lays up a little more treasure in heaven by such opportunities of exercising his piety charity and mercy and while the bitter spirit goes for the aid of the devil to mischief and revenge his enemy the christian spirit with sweetness ease and temper looks up to him who said father forgive them they know not what they do  and when he does thus look up to him and to the new strange lovely world of beatified spirits that he may smile upon each other in the element of love can say blessed jesu grant i may carry my enemies in my heart to intercede for them though they deserve it not and have banished me from theirs a thou carriest me in thine without regarding my unworthiness and that in all circumstances whether good or evil i may have thy cross before my eyes to sweeten my affliction to calm my passions to break my own will to beat down selflove and to draw from this fountain such grace as is necessary to lead a christian that is a crucified life  xx a fourth cause of this impiety of seeking to and consulting wizzards these agents of the devil is covetousness and an eager love of the world  as if when the holy god has permitted any thing to be taken from us we would have it again from the devil rather than be without it  i shall not stay to lay all the dismal load upon this that it would fairly bear but only stay to ask one humble question when god thinks fit to take any thing from us is it fit we should eagerly desire to keep it  much less is it fit we should use the unlawful means of having recourse to the agents of the spirits of darkness as if we would send the devil if we could to wrest a restitution out of gods hands  another cause of this horrid wickedness is impatience and immortification of spirit  we can easily say with job the lord gave blessed be the name of the lord but we have not resignation enough to say the lord has taken away blessed be his name  when indeed this would be the true and proper time of the trial of our allegiance fidelity and love to love him then when his hand lies a little hard upon us  for let him please but to permit your health or goodname or possessions to be taken away you will run to the accursed spirits of darkness in hopes they will find a way to relieve you and be kinder to you than your god who all the while by an affliction only designs to turn your eyes a little more closely to his kingdom or to hedge in your way to it or to lead and conduct you the safer thither or some other kindness or mercy  the next cause of this impiety is distrust of the divine providence  as if god had given up the care and government and conduct of the world to the devil and you would thankfully receive from him and his accursed agents what your god in love and mercy has permitted to be taken from you and will himself give again to you or something better for it if with humble love you depend on him  or as if an affliction should be thankfully received from god you would rather thankfully receive a removal of it from the devil who of himself too has no power to grant it and if it be permitted by god to be granted by the hands and power of the devil or his agents is a dreadful judgment and not a mercy  the last of the most common causes of this impiety is want of love to god that would sweetly incline you to submit to his will and to his wisdom  we sometimes say we are willing his wisdom and goodness and love and care should choose for us in all things but yet we are apt to think we could choose better for our selves nay what is infinitely worse than that such as i am now speaking of think the devil and his wizzards and agents can choose better for them  and would you have this said or remembered of you and charged upon you when the archangels voice shall mingle with the crack and the noise of the dissolving world  to conclude  instead of ever giving the least way to the least correspondence with these agents of the spirits of darkness i mean instead of seeking to any wizzard conjurer or witch in any case whatever start back and tremble at the thought  and thank your god that he has given you any thing that you can lose for him be it health possessions or any thing else rather than receive the least part of them from the hands of the devil  and in the use only of rational natural prudent pious and lawful means look up to a tender father who looks down and sees your needs and dangers and cheerfully  on him he will assuredly direct to the best means and bless them too but then it must not be in your time but in his  and if he do not presently direct you to them it is because he yet sees it best you should not be directed to them  or if he do not think fit either to direct you to them or to bless them it is if you thus affectionately and humbly rely on him because he designs something better for you in lieu of it  and on this you may securely rest  so that dear cousin if you or any friend of yours should by any loss or pain hardship or reproach hope or desire fear or other passion incline ever to a thought of seeking to a conjurer witch or wizzard do not in the least consent or yield to the temptation till you have read a few leaves of this book and have kneeled down and have offered up to god these three short prayers following which your dearest mother the church piously recommends to your use  i fourth sunday after trinity o god the
