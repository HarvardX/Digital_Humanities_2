thy tender flocks with wanton pleasure feed where does my dear my lovely wanderer stray tell me and guide my weary steps that way in vain i trace the plains each winding grove no swain directs me to my absent love close in the covert of some shade he lies some envious shade conceals him from my eyes bear then my soft complainings to his ear ye whispring winds let him my accents hear the wellknown sounds will wake the lingering swain and bring him panting to my arms again alas not yet my cruel love returns i rave my breast with jealous fury burns cold tremblings seize on every vital part the blood runs freezing to my panting heart dim shadows swim before my closing sight and my grieved soul prepares to take its flight hark what sweet accents breaks the ambient air sure it is my loves melodious voice i hear now to my arms my charming shepherd flies heaven to my arms and transport to my eyes oh on thy panting breast let me recline and let thy folding arms around me twine with vows of love my anxious fears control and whisper ease to my distracted soul arise my love the dear enslaver cries my beauteous maid my lovely fair arise for lo the rain is over the winters past and balmy sweets perfume the southern blast like thee all nature smiles the fields around are with a new returning verdure crowned hark what sweet music fills the vocal grove each feathered songster tunes its notes to love what odours do these opening buds exhale yet cannot over thy greater sweets prevail or their enchanting beauties thine excel that lilly shines but with a borrowed grace and roses blush to emulate thy face nor can the violets admired dye match the bright azure of thy shining eye see where you tread fresh blooming flowers arise new charms appear wherever you turn your eyes for thee the streams in softer murmurs flow for thee sweet airs the whispering zephirs blow for thee the cedars form a grateful shade and brighter colors paint the enameled mead oh come then through these sweet meanders stray arise my love my fair one come away yes dearest object of my soft desire thou sweet inspirer of my endless fire with thee i will trace the groves each winding mead and follow where thy charming footsteps lead yet let me view thee on that lovely face let me with fond extatic rapture gaze let thy voice charm me with its magic sound and my fond soul with thrilling pleasure wound for sweets thy beauties to my ravished sight and thy dear voice my listening ears delight see on that couch with natures bounties spread at ease reclined my lovely shepherds laid what beauties in that smiling form appear how soft how mild how more than heavenly fair ye tender virgins awful silence keep ye sighing gales prolong his balmy sleep thou sleepst my love but still thy waking heart bears in my soft inquietudes a part my image ever present with thee seems haunts all thy slumbers and informs thy dreams in every wish in every thought i am thine and oh be thou for ever ever mine behold he wakes and here with transport flies what streaming glories sparkle from his eyes oh turn them from me hide their beauteous beams the sun with less refulgent brightness gleams do not such sweet such magic rays dispense like powerful sweets they overcome my sense oh set me as a seal upon thy heart marked for my own i claim the smallest part should thou but sure the wounding thought is vain for any other lovely maid complain take from me heaven the fleeting breath you gave for loves as strong as death and powerful as the grave the rival nymphs a tale clarissa blessed with every grace a shape divine and charming face had triumphed long over many a swain and often been wooed but wooed in vain not so amanda blooming youth soft innocence and artless truth were all the beauties she could boast not formed by nature for a toast yet some there were who in her mind a thousand nameless charms could find she loved not visits park or play but mopd and read her time away insensible to a degree her heart was all her own and free yet often of loves soft pleasing pains the nymph would write in melting strains the lambent flame that warmed her breast each tender flowing line confessed moneses whose enchanting form was one continued endless charm to whom indulgent heaven had joined all that could beautify a mind had often owned bright beautys power had sighed and loved  for half an hour but yet the lovely youth confessed whoever could wound his destined breast her charms must over time prevail her wit must please when beauty failed yet since he could not hope to find one blessed with all those charms of mind he thought clarissa worth his care and all the hours he had to spare soft vows and tender speaking eyes pleading looks and melting sighs make the believing maid approve his false but well dissembled love but while clarissas charms he owned he with a secret passion burned amanda found the way to win his heart and let her image in his pain the lovely youth conceals all but what his eyes reveals his eyes that all his passion tell and speak the love he felt so well amanda heard the youth complain she heard and felt an equal flame but still with native shyness armed she shuns the lovely swain she charmed his looks his sighs his actions move and in soft language plead for love clarissa still exults and cries he is yet a victim to my eyes he neither will nor can be free me he still loves and only me ah cease to claim my charming prize amanda to the fair replies could i clarissa could i boast the hearts that to thy charms are lost with joy i would them all resign to keep my loved moneses mine in vain the nymph declares her flame clarissa still asserts her claim and till the loved moneses owns the conquering maid for whom he burns till he will the happy fair unfold the sequel must remain untold to a lady singing still sing bright maid nor cease the pleasing charm each soul subdue each tender bosom warm such magic sweetness to thy voice is

listening beasts confessed the magic sound less sweet the harmony amphion made when dancing stones moved to the notes he played or him who bore by dolphins to the shore made winds and waves confess

delia a pastoral aminta thee gentle maid may every muse inspire and phoebus bless thee with poetic fire may thy soft numbers every bosom warm melt into love and into softness charm around our peaceful plains thy praise is spread and wreaths of laurel crown thy youthful head  delia may every grace and blooming charm be thine and the dear joys of peace and friendship mine aminta still my grateful heart shall share though loved philanders image triumphs there  aminta me gentle damon loves nor loves in vain with joy i hear the charming youth complain he only he to tenderness can move melt my soft soul and charm me into love in vain i would my secret pain disguise he reads my passion in my artless eyes  delia from fair to fair the gay philander roved sighed without cause and for a moment loved the charming wanderer no more i fear for me he feels the tender flame sincere  aminta soft as the breeze which fans the silent grove are damons accents when he talk of love too well my fond consenting looks reveal the tender passion i would fain conceal whenever i hear the lovely youth complain my sighs and blushes speak an equal flame  delia with skilful hand when my philander plays and sings alternately in melting lays the woods to the soft harmony resound and my soul dwells on the enchanting sound  aminta when my loved damon sings how sweet the strains echoes repeat them to the distant plains not philomela through the whispering trees like that dear shepherds tuneful voice can please  delia no arts i use to vex my faithful swain nor feign a passion nor affect disdain when the dear youth in plaintive sounds would move my yielding soul to tenderness and love he sees too well the struggling passions rise glow in my cheeks and languish in my eyes knows the soft meaning of each look and steals the tender thoughts which art in vain conceals  aminta when damons absent from my longing eyes a thousand anxious fears and sorrows rise while to the murmurs of you falling stream i sing and damon is the charming theme  delia the lovely object of my soft desire philander only can my songs inspire for him my numbers flow my shepherds praise adorns each line and smooths my artless lays  envy a satire in y  ks detested isle that foe to fame that bane of glory and a virtuous name pale envy dwells and every breast inspires with mortal hatred and destructive fires enthroned she sits with snaky honors crowned and deals her impious power all around deceit on one hand stands with cruel smiles dissembled truths and soft successful wiles but in her hand though half concealed is viewed the pointed dagger deep in rage imbrued scandal on the other hand like fame appears alike her number both of tongues and ears by these the fairest reputation dies and swift and sure the spreading ruin flies round the fell power her anxious votaries throng vain age contemned and unreguarded young these who to virtue wit and beauty lost here strive to blast the fame they cannot boast goddess they cry if ever thy suppliants please when crowds they sacrifice to give thee ease to sooth thy pains when some distinguished name rises to blast thee with an honest fame if by the happy force of fraudful lies sunk in oblivion the bright merit dies if spotless chastity to shame betrayed if charms when blasted in the blooming maid deserve thy smile  the pleasing mischief aid still goddess in our souls thy power increase and to each pointed scandal give success pleased she assents and now each laboring breast is with the baneful furys rage possessed armed with deep malice each reproachful tongue murders the fair the innocent and young with doubtful hints a horrid sense convey and smile a faultless character away but now artelia comes with stealing pace gentle her air but anguish clouds her face merit uninjurd now demands her grief but future scandal gives her soul relief swift through the supplicating crowd she pressed and her bad prayer in whispers is addressed goddess who all my anxious bosom fires who every word and every thought inspires still while thy potent influence i feel let friendships soft disguise my aims conceal and while i spread destructive scandal round beneath that masque let me securely wound it is done  it is granted fly ye virtuous few fly ever her cruel arts your fame pursue see justice from the foul infection flies and frighted hence reseeks her native skies far from the guilty scene averts her sight her own philander cannot retard her flight though her bright image in his breast he bears and all her beauties in his form appears though in his soul she lights her heavenly flame and finds even here a votary in him to moneses singing be hushed as death moneses sings moneses strikes the sounding strings let sacred silence dwell around and naught disturb the magic sound let not the softly whispering breeze sob amidst the rustling trees murmur ye plaintive streams no more but glide in silence to the shore even philomel thy note suspend and to a sweeter song attend ah soft ah dangerous powerful charm an angels voice an angels form attentive to the heavenly lay i hear and gaze my soul away now tender wishes melting fires infant pains and young desires steal into my softened soul and bend it to the sweet control yet let me fly ever it is too late the sweet disease and shun my fate but ah that softly dying strain arrests my steps i strive in vain again i to the siren turn again with gentle fires i burn cease lovely youth the enchanting sound too deep already is the wound through all my veins the poison steals my heart the dear infection feels i faint i die by love oppressed the sigh scarce heaves my panting breast before my view dim shadows rise and hides thee from my ravished eyes thy voice like distant sounds i hear it dies in murmurs on my ear in the too powerful transport tossed even thought and every sense is lost the language of the eyes to lady j  f  i if forced by tyrant custom we the anguish of our souls conceal our eyes yet boast their liberty let them the tender truths reveal in soft persuasive glances speak our grief and from that silent language find relief ii those sweet betrayers of the mind can always lend their welcome aid the thoughts by harsh restraint confined by them are all to view betrayed the doubtful war which hope and fear maintained are by those charming orators explained iii see anger in that sparkling eye this in soft shades of sorrow dressed love smiling hope and tender joy in those enchanting looks expressed the conquering eyes correct the lovers heart and as they smile or frown their hopes and fears impart iv ye fair who strive with darts to arm the languid beauties of your eyes of isabellas learn to charm like hers the ravished soul surprise her mind does all their glorious beams dispense bright as they are they owe their rays to sense to aurelia on her attempting to write verses long had aurelia vainly strove to write in melting strains of love ambitious of a poets name she wept she sighed she longed for fame while of the great design possessed she thus the delian god addressed brightest of heavenly powers above immortal son of thundering jove oh glorious deity impart to me the soft poetic art vouchsafe to me thy sacred fire and with thyself my soul inspire she spoke  the god indulgent hears the beauteous maid and grants her prayers on clio turns his radiant eyes and to the tuneful goddess cries fly hence to fair aurelias aid in heavenly strains instruct the maid the muse obeys the gods commands with joy and swift as thought descends and at aurelias side attends conscious of her new power the maid with thanks the glorious gift repaid now wallers sweetness granvilles fire at once her tuneful breast inspire no more she vainly strives to please the ready numbers flow with ease all soft harmonious and divine apollo shines in every line the delian god with rapture filled upon his lovely pupil smiled daphne his oncelovd charming care appeared to him not half so fair for the lost nymph he mourns no more nor in his songs her loss deplore but from the slighted tree he tears it is leaves to deck aurelias hairs a poet now by all she is owned and with immortal honor crowned on a ladys singing how was i charmed when fair harmonia sung what heavenly sweetness dwelt upon her tongue what melting joys did her soft song impart oh power of music on a tender heart while she repeats the lovers ardent pains my sympathising soul with her complains soft flow the tears the gentle sorrows rise and my full bosom heaves with strugling sighs but when a faithful generous pairs her theme when in soft sounds she sings their mutual flame it is then i feel the lovers soft excess share in their joy and triumph in their bliss wish i may thus to tenderness be moved and love like them like them to be beloved oh say bright virgin by what powerful art thy song gives real raptures to the heart and makes the struggling soul alternate prove the joys of true and pangs of perjured love a voice less fine than yours the bard possessed whose magic sweetness moving trees confessed on mortals thy superior skill is shown and hearts subdued thy greater power own to flavia an ode i if flavia in thy faultless form all that is heavenlyfair we find if every grace conspires to charm and speaks the beauties of thy mind ii why should thou wonder lovely maid at the soft passions you inspire why those to hopeless love betrayed or these feel friendships sacred fire iii heedless thy charming eyes enslave nor know the smiling deaths they dart naught can the wretched gazer save or rescue his devoted heart iv but ah to win the soul is more and friendships nobler fires impart the work of some diviner power and reason wings the unerring dart v let thy adorers justly praise the wondrous beauties of thy face extol thy charms a thousand ways and with thy name their numbers grace vi friendship a nobler theme shall find and to the admiring world display the graces that adorn thy mind a subject that will never decay vii when thy bright eyes shall cease to wound and age thy fading charms embrace when in thy looks no trace is found of what the lovely flavia was viii the lasting beauties of thy mind the muse in gentle strains shall sing in thy fair soul new charms shall find to raise her voice and prune her wing a song i what torments must the virgin prove that feels the pangs of hopeless love what endless cares must rack the breast that is by sure despair possessed ii when love in tender bosoms reigns with all its soft its pleasing pains why should it be a crime to own the fatal flame we cannot shun iii the soul by nature formed sincere a slavish forced disguise must wear left the unthinking world reprove the heart that glows with generous love iv but oh in vain the sighs represt that gently heaves the pensive breast the glowing blush the falling tear the conscious wish and silent fear v ye soft betrayers aid my flame and give my new desires a name some power my gentle griefs redress reveal or make my passion less on reading hutchison on the passions thou who through natures various faults can rove and show what springs the eager passions move teach us to combat anger grief and fear recall the sigh and stop the falling tear oh be thy soft philosophy addressed to the untroubled ear and tranquil breast to these be all thy peaceful notions taught who idly rove amidst a calm of thought whose soul by love or hate were never possessed who never were wretched and who never were blessed whose fainter wishes pleasures fears remain dreams but of bliss and shadows of a pain serenely stupid so some shallow stream flows through the winding valleys still the same whom no rude wind can ever discompose who fears no winter rain or falling snows but slowly down its flowery borders creeps and the soft zephyr on its bosom sleeps oh could thou teach the tortured soul to know with patience each extreme of human woe to bear with ills and unrepining prove the frowns of fortune and the racks of love still should my breast some quiet moments share still rise superior to each threatening care nor fear approaching ills or distant woes but in philanders absence find repose the question since freed from loves enchanting pains your heart no longer wears my chains since the gay folly charms no more and all the dear delusions over yet tell me damon do you prove in freedom joys so pure as love alike unfelt its pains or sweets your heart an equal measure beats no longer hope and fear maintain within your breast a doubtful reign unpleasd nor caring if you please lost in a dull inactive ease since then for this you could forego the lovers sweetlypleasing woe forsake those bright enlivening fires gay hopes and elegant desires the mutual wish the equal flame the sorrows fears and hopes the same oh say what joys can freedom boast like those sweet torments you have lost the advice an ode i beneath a myrtles spreading shade the sadly weeping delia lay soft zephyrs fanned the pensive maid and wasted every sigh away ii dear conscious stream she softly cried whose plaintive murmurs sooth my pain how often on thy flowery side did damon at my feet complain iii reclined in yonder silent grove how did the lovely youth protest the softest truest fondest love that ever warmed a faithful breast iv but ah those vows no longer bind no more my gentle sway he owns for some coy nymph less fair and kind the dear betrayer sighs and burns v thus mourned the fair neglected maid when sprightly cloe thither came and is it thus she laughing said that delia cures a slighted flame vi no more indulge this fruitless grief if damons false to you and love the god that wounds can bring relief another may the first remove vii believe me friend the cruel flame which tortures now thy gentle breast the object changed will burn the same and you in mutual love be blessed viii strephon who all this time concealed the virgins soft complaints had heard his beauteous form at length revealed and thus his tender vows preferred ix if love like mine that can endure though the dear object be its foe if absence nor disdain can cure a hopeless flame that burns in woe x if such a pure a constant fire may hope for pity in thy breast strephon shall still the heart inspire that once received him for a guest xi delia no more my love shall fly but with returning fondness own that damon merits less than i who never loved but her alone xii amazed confused the blushing maid found her wronged lover still the same in vain she called her pride to aid against the sweet returning flame xiii that melting voice that heavenly form those eyes that shone with soft desire each grace inspires her soul to charm and kindle up the latent fire xiv fain she would her tender thoughts impart her bashful tongue the task denies impatient to be known her heart gives all its softness to her eyes xv in them soft wishes stood confessed sweet remorse and conscious love every fear her soul possessed and all that could those fears remove xvi convinced oerjoyd the lovely youth saw the reluctant pleasing pain vows at her feet eternal truth blesses her sway and hugs his chain ardelia to flavia an epistle thou dearest object of my fondest love what words can speak the misery i prove doomed as i am by my relentless fate to bear the worst of dreaded ills your hate loved though thou were in every action just have i not wronged thee by unkind distrust believed thee false when love and truth were thine and all the tender joys of friendship mine wretch that i am my fatal crime i know and merit all the anger you can show do hate me loath me drive me from your breast that seat of softness innocence and rest bid me my fatal rashness ever mourn fly my loathed sight and curse me with your scorn but oh though anger should each grace transform and change to roughness every smiling charm though those bright eyes where love and sweetness shine should with the coldest glances look on mine though that harmonious that enchanting tongue where all the force of soft persuasion hung chide me in cruel sounds with fury warmed and wound the ears it has so often charmed still would i bear it all with patience bear and whisper to my soul your triumph there but sure in pity to my tender pains some spark of friendship in thy breast remains to that i will sue the languid flame to raise and wake the sleeping passion to a blaze try every art thy anger to control and watch each yielding moment in thy soul some tender fit of softness in thy breast when loves awake and anger charmed to rest for sure my flavia cannot always prove deaf to the tender prayers and tears of love oh teach me thou fair softness to atone for all the wrongs i have to thy friendship done with thy own sweetness thy just rage disarm and learn me all thy wellknown power to charm direct me how to make my vows believed to move thy pity and thy love retrieve oh with returning ardour ever bless the heart which you and only you possess an ode to sleep i come gentle god of soft repose and charm my soul to rest in thy embraces let me lose the cares that rack my breast ii arise ye dear deceits arise and dressed in damons form my longexpecting wishing eyes with his resemblance charm iii those melting sounds still let me hear which did his flame impart which blessed with love my listening ear and pierced my yielding heart iv why rove my thoughts on fancied bliss which only dreams bestow for oh whenever the morn appears i wake to real woe v the envious light from my sad eyes drives all my bliss away with night the lovely phantom flies and leaves me lost in day vi since waking then i am distressed and pleasures fled with him if sleeping i can still be blessed let life be all a dream an ode in imitation of sapho i me the loveliest truest swain often woos but woos in vain tender soft beseeching eyes pleading tears and melting sighs such soft pains as lovers feel such his dying looks reveal ii yet by pride by shame withheld every yielding thoughts repelled scarce the sigh that heaves my breast scarce the falling tears represt yet may artful tongue denies my love and contradicts my eyes iii if then charming youth you would know all my love and all my woe all my heart without disguise read it in my artless eyes they will in tender language tell what i would in vain conceal iv there each yielding thought betrayed all my hopes add fears displayed the soft flame which warms my breast in each melting looks confessed while unstudied glances prove all is truth and all is love a song i damon in vain you strive to move it is true my heart was formed for love and own its native flame but such a flame so pure a fire philander only can inspire and all its softness claim ii no more of cruel scorn complain too late alas you owned your pain too late to find a cure if friendship to your views be due taste all the ease that can bestow but damon ask no more a parody on an ode of horace as translated by mr farquhar in love where cares distract the mind where fear to smiling hope is joined where grief the longsought joy precedes and late remorse that joy invades show me among the happiest there who would not wish for freedom here in freedom friend the wise delights for this the curtaintutord nights for this she storms the peaceful man and curses nuptial ties in vain since love then is too weak to cure that female vice the thirst of power happy the maid who guards her heart against the sweetlypainful dart who charmed by liberty alone will no intruding passion own in love what can we hope to find but pleasures that leave stings behind delusive hopes of happiness airy dreams of fancied bliss which shadowlike will disappear when the approaching form comes near cease then to court a certain ill if free at present keep so still forbear that meaning glance to throw the dart which meditates the foe may back upon thyself recoil and catch thee in the artful toil love over the abject breast may reign with all its light fantastic train of wishes cares and fond desires fears and hopes and jealous fires be mine from the soft folly free freedom alone has charms for me the dream ah stay fair fleeting form i charge thee stay whither ah whither would thou glide away ardelia calls thee lovely cruel shade ardelia bids thee stay thy once loved maid alas in vain i call for see he flies flies my fond clasping arms and ardent eyes not all my prayers can the loved form detain my sighs my tears my wishes are in vain in gentle slumbers morpheus close my eyes and bid once more the lovely phantom rise bid him in all those heavenly charms appear that melting softness that engaging air in that too powerful sorrow let him shine when first he gave his heart and conquered mine hence then ye sorrows from the fancied scene despairs eternal sighs and secret pain shall wound no more no thought my bliss destroy no happy rival interrupt my joy for oh whatever my cruel fates design in sleep philander can be only mine a song i in vain i strive with female art to hide the motions of my heart my eyes my secret flame declare and damon reads his triumph there ii when from his fond his ardent gaze with frowns i turn aside my face my cheeks with conscious blushes glow and all my souls disorder show iii or when with seeming scorn i hear the youth his tender vows prefer from my fond breast reluctant steals a sigh and all the truth reveals iv oh love allpowerful over the mind art thou to rigid rules confined and must the heart that owns thy sway that tyrant customs laws obey v oh let me break the cruel chain and freely own my tender pain by harsh restraint no longer swayed confirm whatever my eyes have said the art of coquettry ye lovely maids whose yet unpracticed hearts never felt the force of loves resistless darts who justly set a value on your charms power all your wish but beauty all your arms who over mankind would fain exert your sway and teach the lordly tyrant to obey attend my rules to you alone addressed deep let them sink in every female breast the queen of love herself my bosom fires assists my numbers and my thoughts inspires me she instructed in each secret art how to enslave and keep the vanquished heart when the stolen sigh to heave or drop the tear the melting languish the obliging fear halfstifled wishes broken kind replies and all the various motions of the eyes to teach the fair by different ways to move the softened soul and bend the heart to love proud of her charms and conscious of her face the haughty beauty calls forth every grace with fierce defiance throws the killing dart by force she wins by force she keeps the heart the witty fair on nobler game pursues aims at the head but the rapt soul subdues the languid nymph enslaves with softer art with sweet neglect she steals into the heart slowly she moves her swimming eyes around conceals her shaft but meditates the wound her gentle languishments the gazers move her voice is music and her looks are love though not to all heaven does these gifts impart what is theirs by nature may be yours by art but let your airs be suited to your face nor to a languish tack a sprightly grace the short round face brisk eyes and auburn hair must smiling joy in every motion wear her quick unsettled glances deal around hide her design and seem by chance to wound dark rolling eyes a languish may assume and tender looks and melting airs become the pensive head upon the hand reclined as if some sweet disorder filled the mind let the heaved breast a struggling sigh restrain and seem to stop the falling tear with pain the youth who all the soft distress believes soon wants the kind compassion which he gives but beauty wit and youth may sometimes fail nor always over the stubborn soul prevail then let the fair one have recourse to art and if not vanquish undermine the heart first from your artful looks with studious care from mild to grave from tender to severe often on the careless youth your glances dart a tender meaning let each look impart whenever he meets your looks with modest pride and soft confusion turn your eyes aside let a soft sigh steal out as if by chance then cautious turn and steal another glance caught by these arts with pride and hope elate the destined victim rushes on his fate pleased his imagined victory pursues and the kind maid with softened glances views contemplates now her shape her air her face and thinks each feature wears an added grace till gratitude which first his bosom proves by slow degrees is ripened into love it is harder still to fix than gain a heart what is won by beauty must be kept by art too kind a treatment the blessed lover cloys and often despair the growing flame destroys sometimes with smiles receive him sometimes tears and wisely balance both his hopes and fears perhaps he mourns his illrequited pains condemns your sway and strives to break his chains behaves as if he now your scorn defied and thinks at least he shall alarm your pride but with indifference view the seeming change and let your eyes after new conquests range while his torn breast with jealous fury burns he hopes despairs hates and adores by turns with anguish now repents the weak deceit and powerful passion bears him to your feet strive not the jealous lover to perplex ill suits suspension with that haughty sex rashly they judge and always think the worst and love is often banished by distrust to these an open free behavior wear avoid disguise and seem at least sincere whenever you meet affect a glad surprise and give unmelting softness to your eyes by some unguarded word your love reveal and anxiously the rising blush conceal by arts like these the jealous you deceive then most deluded when they most believe but while in all you seek to raise desire beware the fatal passion you inspire each soft intruding wish in time reprove and guard against the sweet envader love not for the tender were these rules designed who in their faces show their yielding mind eyes that a native languishment can wear whose smiles are artless and whose blush sincere but the gay nymph who liberty can prize and vindicate the triumph of her eyes who over mankind a haughty rule maintains whose wit can manage what her beauty gains such by these arts their empire may improve and what they lost by nature gain by love to mira inviting her to a retreat in the country now spring returning decks the year with all that is lovely all that is fair the fields in lively green arrayed with deeper glooms the silent shade soft descends the gentle showers and wakes to life the springing flowers hence ambrosial sweets exhale and various colors paint the vale refreshing airs the zephyrs blow the streams with pleasing murmurs flow while nightly midst the silent plain thy favorite bird renews her strain come then my mira come and share my joys and breath a purer air together let us range the plains amongst the rustic nmyphs and swains in rural dress devoid of cure give to the winds our flowing hair and round the meadows gayly roam for youth does sober mirth become now straining up you airy height well entertain the wandering sight with flowery fields and waving woods hills and dales and falling floods or to relieve the searching eyes see distant spires and temples rise come now my mira let us rove together through the mazy grove here while with gentle pace we walk beguile the time with pleasing talk here show thy melting eloquence thy sprightly wit thy manly sense thy virtuous notions void of art and while you charm correct the heart or now together careless laid beneath a cypress spreading shade our thoughts to heavenly numbers raise repeating popes harmonious lays now homers awful leaves turn over or graver history explore or study platos sacred page uncommon to our sex and age now wandering by the moons pale light amidst the silent shades of night where on the late deserted plains a pleasing melancholy reigns softly through the rustling trees sobs the sweetly dying breeze the echos catch the plaintive sound and gentle murmurs breathe around now sing my friend and let thy strain recount the arts of faithless man thy notes sweet philomel shall join and mix her soft complaints with thine but raise my mira raise thy song to friendship nobler strains belong oh sing its tender chaste desires its equal pure and lasting fires such as in thy bosom burns such as my fond soul returns friendship is but love refined not weakens but exalts the mind and when its sacred power we prove we guess how heavenly spirits love verses wrote extempore on a gentlemans playing on the flute i oh cease thy too harmonious strain nor thus my ravished soul surprise what new ideas pleasing pains does by the sweet enchantment rise ii lulled by the dear bewitching sound each jarring passions charmed to rest yet my soul feels a pleasing wound and sweet disorders fill my breast iii forbear to show thy heavenly art nor aim a conquest over my mind by music softened to the dart love may an easy entrance find an epistle to moneses in imitation of ovid when urged by honor from thy sight i flew and scarce would breath one tender soft adieu from thy dear face i turned my gazing eyes suppressed the tears and checked the rising sighs selfbanishd all despairs worst pangs i prove i fled from you but could not fly from love oh do not then my lovely swain accuse my want of truth nor charge on me thy woes for every pain which racks thy faithful breast a thousand more my anxious soul oppressed sorrows for which descriptions all too faint and equal misery alone can paint dearer than light to these fond eyes you are my first my last and still my only care my hapless flame nor time nor absence cures still constant to the vows which made me yours ah why then in that sadlypleasing strain why does moneses of his wrongs complain forbear to send me what thy muse inspired by illrequited love and absence fired deep in my soul thy soft reproaches steal and all thy griefs redoubled there i feel still round my heart plays the same lambient flame each wish and every fond desire the same nor can thy pen one piercing woe reveal which thy ardelia does not equal feel ah dear idea of my lovely swain ah soft remembrance of my former pain why to my anxious breast do you return why wake a flame which must for ever burn still shall that lovely image charm my view and those dear accents all my grief renew still must i love though honor love deny and bids me from the dangerous charmer fly ah then how vain how fruitless all my care this welcome absence this confirmed despair this cruel contest between love and fame these endless pangs for which i want a name why does moneses still love on why share in all those sorrows i alone should bear all tender as thou were all soft and kind i flew and with thee left my soul behind i left thee fancied honor to pursue just to myself but more unjust to you why then my image do thou still retain why for a wretch unworthy thee complain o rather hate me drive me from your breast by scorn and hate be all thy soul possessed let thy fond heart thy oncelovd chains resign complete thy cure and o assist in mine why did i love why did my easy heart admit the dear but ah too dangerous dart why did i not the pleasing torment shun why fondly listen to the pleasing tongue quick to my heart the subtle poison stole charmed all my senses and enslaved my soul and less the beauty of thy matchless form then thy prevailing eloquence could charm oh come once more moneses and renew those tender vows and i will believe them true let me once more behold those melting eyes where love a thousand nameless charms supplies the soft enchantment shall my fears control and love claim all his empire in my soul ah whether would my boundless wishes rove still still am i enslaved by guilty love still shall its lawless fires my soul profane and is my boasted virtue but a name no i will forget thee drive thee from my breast thou dear undoer of my peace and rest yet how forget when every thought is thine even life itself were easier to resign to lonely shades in vain i fly for ease there secret sigh and feed the sweet disease on thy dear name i call and all around the whispering winds repeat the charming sound it is thus i wear the anxious hours away till night restores the sorrows of the day then does thy image to my eyes appear but ah with looks averse and frowns severe still as you seem to chide me with your eyes my own in streaming tears to yours replies oh stay i cry thou charming phantom stay or with thee take my fleeting soul away in vain i call my clasping arms you shun and waking find the dear delusion gone thus does ardelia hunt thy boding dream does she like thee all cold and cruel seem or does the pensive shade soft sorrows wear heave the faint sigh and shed the mimick tear on thy loved breast her painful head recline and tell thee that her torments equal thine why can i not this fatal flame remove or why o why is it a crime to love by turns my reason and my passion sway as honor triumphs and as love betray my tortured breast conflicting passions tear and love and virtue wage unequal war now all its sacred precepts i pursue lost for a while is every thought of you but oh again the guilty lover burns and all the woman in my soul returns again my bosom glows with soft desire and hope returning fans the fatal fire seas rolls between us but the active mind still springs to thee and leaves its load behind oh should some happy chance to us unknown without a crime confirm me all thy own blessed be these tender griefs these anxious fears these neverceasing sighs and flowing tears oh let my soul the pleasing hope retain one hour of joy repays whole years of pain to suffering martyrs thus such hopes are given such views of promised joys and future heaven for this resigned they calmly meet their fate conscious of blessings in a happier state an ode i ah cease to grieve fond fluttering heart thy charming conqueror returns hence every doubt each fear depart the youth with equal passion burns ii haste gentle winds and waft him here nor long my loved philander keep grant queen of love a lovers prayer sooth into smiles thy native deep iii while i thy gentle power address view the dear object of my care view him bright goddess and confess a lovelier adonis there iv then can my vows be fruitless paid when in that loveinspiring form those melting graces are displayed which your celestial breast could warm v come then my souls enslaver come to these fond eyes their bliss restore be these encircling arms thy home and fate shall never part us more song in vain i strive to fly this soul consuming care my sorrows always nigh and present every where in vain i trace the grove there no repose i find what place can banish love from the subjected mind that pensivefalling stream those gales that whisper round increase the fatal flame and deeper fix the wound the silent shades of night adds horror to my grief the gay return of light to me brings no relief in answer to consolatory verses wrote by a friend with ease advice to virtuous woe we give but ah how few by stoic rules can live virtue distressed in melting verse appears beauteous in misery and adorned in tears but in the world it is viewed with other eyes virtue in rags is beauty in disguise and can no more contempt and scorn disarm then a fair face behind a masque can charm whatever gifts we may to nature owe success is all our merit here below by fortune favored fools may rise to fame without it virtue is an empty name shallum to hilpah an epistle from the spectator what thought can figure all my vast distress what words the anguish of my soul express when to my rival you resigned your charms and filled his richer but less faithful arms loathing the suns bright rays to shades i fly and your dear name to whispering zephyrs sigh the whispering zephyrs your dear name reply these threescore years and ten thy loss i have mourned while tirzahs hills my loud complaint returned dark gloomy groves to raise have been my care fit scenes of hopeless love and black despair but now oh  hilpah paradise appears and a new eden rises midst my tears here opening flowers the ravished sense invade there spreading cedars form a grateful shade soft gliding streams which murmur as they flow and gales that all arabias odours blow come up then my beloved oh come and grace this spot of earth with a young lovely race let a fair numerous offspring fill each shade and anewpeopled world by thee be made remember fair one that the age of man is but a thousand years and quickly gone beauty though much admired yet soon is past its transient glories but some centuries last like a tall oak which long on tirzahs height displayed its growing branches to the sight now worn with age it falls nor thought of more unless some root its memory restore which with increasing verdure still may rise and like its parenttree invade the skies think well on this then haste to make me blessed be happy now and leave to fate the rest finis
