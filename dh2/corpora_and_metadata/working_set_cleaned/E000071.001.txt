the expedition of humphry clinker  by tobias smollett     to mr henry davis bookseller in london  abergavenny aug    respected sir  i have received your esteemed favour of the   th ultimo whereby it appeareth that you have perused those same letters the which were delivered unto you by my friend the reverend mr hugo behn and i am pleased to find you think they may be printed with a good prospect of success in as much as the objections you mention i humbly conceive are such as may be redargued if not entirely removedand first in the first place as touching what prosecutions may arise from printing the private correspondence of persons still living give me leave with all due submission to observe that the letters in question were not written and sent under the seal of secrecy that they have no tendency to the mala fama or prejudice of any person whatsoever but rather to the information and edification of mankind so that it becometh a sort of duty to promulgate them in usum publicum besides i have consulted mr davy higgins an eminent attorney of this place who after due inspection and consideration declareth that he doth not think the said letters contain any matter which will be held actionable in the eye of the law finally if you and i should come to a right understanding i do declare in verbo sacerdotis that in case of any such prosecution i will take the whole upon my own shoulders even quoad fine and imprisonment though i must confess i should not care to undergo flagellation tam ad turpitudinem quam ad amaritudinem poenoe spectanssecondly concerning the personal resentment of mr justice lismahago i may say non flocci facioi would not willingly vilipend any christian if peradventure he deserveth that epithet albeit i am much surprised that more care is not taken to exclude from the commission all such vagrant foreigners as may be justly suspected of disaffection to our happy constitution in church and stategod forbid that i should be so uncharitable as to affirm positively that the said lismahago is no better than a jesuit in disguise but this i will assert and maintain totis viribus that from the day he qualified he has never been once seen intra templi parietes that is to say within the parish church  thirdly with respect to what passed at mr kendals table when the said lismahago was so brutal in his reprehensions i must inform you my good sir that i was obliged to retire not by fear arising from his minatory reproaches which as i said above i value not of a rush but from the sudden effect produced by a barbels row which i had eaten at dinner not knowing that the said row is at certain seasons violently cathartic as galen observeth in his chapter peri ichtos  fourthly and lastly with reference to the manner in which i got possession of these letters it is a circumstance that concerns my own conscience only sufficeth it to say i have fully satisfied the parties in whose custody they were and by this time i hope i have also satisfied you in such ways that the last hand may be put to our agreement and the work proceed with all convenient expedition in which i hope i rest  respected sir your very humble servant  jonathan dustwich  ps i propose deo volente to have the pleasure of seeing you in the great city towards allhallowtide when i shall be glad to treat with you concerning a parcel of ms sermons of a certain clergyman deceased a cake of the right leaven for the present taste of the public verbum sapienti c  jd     to the revd mr jonathan dustwich at  sir  i received yours in course of post and shall be glad to treat with you for the ms which i have delivered to your friend mr behn but can by no means comply with the terms proposed those things are so uncertainwriting is all a lotteryi have been a loser by the works of the greatest men of the agei could mention particulars and name names but dont choose itthe taste of the town is so changeable then there have been so many letters upon travels lately publishedwhat between smolletts sharps derricks thicknesses baltimores and barettis together with shandys sentimental travels the public seems to be cloyed with that kind of entertainmentnevertheless i will if you please run the risque of printing and publishing and you shall have half the profits of the impressionyou need not take the trouble to bring up your sermons on my accountno body reads sermons but methodists and dissentersbesides for my own part i am quite a stranger to that sort of reading and the two persons whose judgment i depended upon in those matters are out of the way one is gone abroad carpenter of a man of war and the other has been silly enough to abscond in order to avoid a prosecution for blasphemyim a great loser by his going offhe has left a manual of devotion half finished on my hands after having received money for the whole copyhe was the soundest divine and had the most orthodox pen of all my people and i never knew his judgment fail but in flying from his bread and butter on this occasion  by owning you was not put in bodily fear by lismahago you preclude yourself from the benefit of a good plea over and above the advantage of binding him over in the late war i inserted in my evening paper a paragraph that came by the post reflecting upon the behaviour of a certain regiment in battle an officer of said regiment came to my shop and in the presence of my wife and journeyman threatened to cut off my earsas i exhibited marks of bodily fear more ways than one to the conviction of the byestanders i bound him over my action lay and i recovered as for flagellation you have nothing to fear and nothing to hope on that headthere has been but one printer flogged at the carts tail these thirty years that was charles watson and he assured me it was no more than a fleabite c s has been threatened several times by the house of l but it came to nothing if an information should be moved for and granted against you as the editor of those letters i hope you will have honesty and wit enough to appear and take your trialif you should be sentenced to the pillory your fortune is madeas times go thats a sure step to honour and preferment i shall think myself happy if i can lend you a lift and am very sincerely  yours  henry davis london aug  0th  please my kind service to your neighbour my cousin madoci have sent

april  nd     to sir watkin phillips bart of jesus college oxon  dear phillips  as i have nothing more at heart than to convince you i am incapable of forgetting or neglecting the friendship i made at college now begin that correspondence by letters which you and i agreed at parting to cultivate i begin it sooner than i intended that you may have it in your power to refute any idle reports which may be circulated to my prejudice at oxford touching a foolish quarrel in which i have been involved on account of my sister who had been some time settled here in a boardingschool when i came hither with my uncle and aunt who are our guardians to fetch her away i found her a fine tall girl of seventeen with an agreeable person but remarkably simple and quite ignorant of the world this disposition and want of experience had exposed her to the addresses of a personi know not what to call him who had seen her at a play and with a confidence and dexterity peculiar to himself found means to be recommended to her acquaintance it was by the greatest accident i intercepted one of his letters as it was my duty to stifle this correspondence in its birth i made it my business to find him out and tell him very freely my sentiments of the matter the spark did not like the stile i used and behaved with abundance of mettle though his rank in life which by the bye i am ashamed to declare did not entitle him to much deference yet as his behaviour was remarkably spirited i admitted him to the privilege of a gentleman and something might have happened had not we been preventedin short the business took air i know not how and made abundance of noiserecourse was had to justicei was obliged to give my word and honour c and tomorrow morning we set out for bristol wells where i expect to hear from you by the return of the posti have got into a family of originals whom i may one day attempt to describe for your amusement my aunt mrs tabitha bramble is a maiden of fortyfive exceedingly starched vain and ridiculousmy uncle is an odd kind of humorist always on the fret and so unpleasant in his manner that rather than be obliged to keep him company id resign all claim to the inheritance of his estate indeed his being tortured by the gout may have soured his temper and perhaps i may like him better on further acquaintance certain it is all his servants and neighbours in the country are fond of him even to a degree of enthusiasm the reason of which i cannot as yet comprehend remember me to griffy price gwyn mansel basset and all the rest of my old cambrian companionssalute the bedmaker in my namegive my service to the cook and pray take care of poor ponto for the sake of his old master who is and ever will be  dear phillips your affectionate friend and humble servant jer melford gloucester april       to mrs jermyn at her house in gloucester  dear madam  having no mother of my own i hope you will give me leave to disburden my poor heart to you who have always acted the part of a kind parent to me ever since i was put under your care indeed and indeed my worthy governess may believe me when i assure her that i never harboured a thought that was otherwise than virtuous and if god will give me grace i shall never behave so as to cast a reflection on the care you have taken in my education i confess i have given just cause of offence by my want of prudence and experience i ought not to have listened to what the young man said and it was my duty to have told you all that passed but i was ashamed to mention it and then he behaved so modest and respectful and seemed to be so melancholy and timorous that i could not find in my heart to do any thing that should make him miserable and desperate as for familiarities i do declare i never once allowed him the favour of a salute and as to the few letters that passed between us they are all in my uncles hands and i hope they contain nothing contrary to innocence and honouri am still persuaded that he is not what he appears to be but time will discovermean while i will endeavour to forget a connexion which is so displeasing to my family i have cried without ceasing and have not tasted any thing but tea since i was hurried away from you nor did i once close my eyes for three nights runningmy aunt continues to chide me severely when we are by ourselves but i hope to soften her in time by humility and submissionmy uncle who was so dreadfully passionate in the beginning has been moved by my tears and distress and is now all tenderness and compassion and my brother is reconciled to me on my promise to break off all correspondence with that unfortunate youth but notwithstanding all their indulgence i shall have no peace of mind till i know my dear and ever honoured governess has forgiven her poor disconsolate forlorn  affectionate humble servant till death lydia melford clifton april       to miss laetitia willis at gloucester  my dearest letty  i am in such a fright lest this should not come safe to hand by the conveyance of jarvis the carrier that i beg you will write me on the receipt of it directing to me under cover to mrs winifred jenkins my aunts maid who is a good girl and has been so kind to me in my affliction that i have made her my confidant as for jarvis he was very shy of taking charge of my letter and the little parcel because his sister sally had like to have lost her place on my account indeed i cannot blame the man for his caution but i have made it worth his whilemy dear companion and bedfellow it is a grievous addition to my other misfortunes that i am deprived of your agreeable company and conversation at a time when i need so much the comfort of your good humour and good sense but i hope the friendship we contracted at boardingschool will last for lifei doubt not but on my side it will daily increase and improve as i gain experience and learn to know the value of a true friend o my dear letty what shall i say about poor mr wilson i have promised to break off all correspondence and if possible to forget him but alas i begin to perceive that will not be in my power as it is by no means proper that the picture should remain in my hands lest it should be the occasion of more mischief i have sent it to you by this opportunity begging you will either keep it safe till better times or return it to mr wilson himself who i suppose will make it his business to see you at the usual place if he should be lowspirited at my sending back his picture you may tell him i have no occasion for a picture while the original continues engraved on mybut no i would not have you tell him that neither because there must be an end of our correspondencei wish he may forget me for the sake of his own peace and yet if he should he must be a barbarousbut it is impossiblepoor wilson cannot be false and inconstant i beseech him not to write to me nor attempt to see me for some time for considering the resentment and passionate temper of my brother jery such an attempt might be attended with consequences which would make us all miserable for lifelet us trust to time and the chapter of accidents or rather to that providence which will not fail sooner or later to reward those that walk in the paths of honour and virtue i would offer my love to the young ladies but it is not fit that any of them should know you have received this letterif we go to bath i shall send you my simple remarks upon that famous center of polite amusement and every other place we may chance to visit and i flatter myself that my dear miss willis will be punctual in answering the letters of her affectionate  lydia melford clifton april       to dr lewis  dear lewis  i have followed your directions with some success and might have been upon my legs by this time had the weather permitted me to use my saddlehorse i rode out upon the downs last tuesday in the forenoon when the sky as far as the visible horizon was without a cloud but before i had gone a full mile i was overtaken instantaneously by a storm of rain that wet me to the skin in three minuteswhence it came the devil knows but it has laid me up i suppose for one fortnight it makes me sick to hear people talk of the fine air upon cliftondowns how can the air be either agreeable or salutary where the demon of vapours descends in a perpetual drizzle my confinement is the more intolerable as i am surrounded with domestic vexations my niece has had a dangerous fit of illness occasioned by that cursed incident at gloucester which i mentioned in my lastshe is a poor goodnatured simpleton as soft as butter and as easily meltednot that shes a foolthe girls parts are not despicable and her education has not been neglected that is to say she can write and spell and speak french and play upon the harpsichord then she dances finely has a good figure and is very well inclined but shes deficient in spirit and so susceptibleand so tender forsoothtruly she has got a languishing eye and reads romancesthen theres her brother squire jery a pert jackanapes full of collegepetulance and selfconceit proud as a german count and as hot and hasty as a welch mountaineer as for that fantastical animal my sister tabby you are no stranger to her qualificationsi vow to god she is sometimes so intolerable that i almost think shes the devil incarnate come to torment me for my sins and yet i am conscious of no sins that ought to entail such familyplagues upon mewhy the devil should not i shake off these torments at once i ant married to tabby thank heaven nor did i beget the other two let them choose another guardian for my part i ant in a condition to take care of myself much less to superintend the conduct of giddyheaded boys and girls you earnestly desire to know the particulars of our adventure at gloucester which are briefly these and i hope they will go no furtherliddy had been so long copped up in a boardingschool which next to a nunnery is the worst kind of seminary that ever was contrived for young women that she became as inflammable as touchwood and going to a play in holidaytimesdeath im ashamed to tell you she fell in love with one of the actorsa handsome young fellow that goes by the name of wilson the rascal soon perceived the impression he had made and managed matters so as to see her at a house where she went to drink tea with her governessthis was the beginning of a correspondence which they kept up by means of a jade of a milliner who made and dressed caps for the girls at the boardingschool when we arrived at gloucester liddy came to stay at lodgings with her aunt and wilson bribed the maid to deliver a letter into her own hands but it seems jery had already acquired so much credit with the maid by what means he best knows that she carried the letter to him and so the whole plot was discovered the rash boy without saying a word of the matter to me went immediately in search of wilson and i suppose treated him with insolence enough the theatrical hero was too far gone in romance to brook such usage he replied in blank verse and a formal challenge ensued they agreed to meet early next morning and decide the dispute with sword and pistol i heard nothing at all of the affair till mr morley came to my bedside in the morning and told me he was afraid my nephew was going to fight as he had been overheard talking very loud and vehement with wilson at the young mans lodgings the night before and afterwards went and bought powder and ball at a shop in the neighbourhood i got up immediately and upon inquiry found he was just going out i begged morley to knock up the mayor that he might interpose as a magistrate and in the mean time i hobbled after the squire whom i saw at a distance walking at a great pace towards the city gatein spite of all my efforts i could not come up till our two combatants had taken their ground and were priming their pistols an old house luckily screened me from their view so that i rushed upon them at once before i was perceived they were both confounded and attempted to make their escape different ways but morley coming up with constables at that instant took wilson into custody and jery followed him quietly to the mayors house all this time i was ignorant of what had passed the preceding day and neither of the parties would discover a tittle of the matter the mayor observed that it was great presumption in wilson who was a stroller to proceed to such extremities with a gentleman of family and fortune and threatened to commit him on the vagrant actthe young fellow bustled up with great spirit declaring he was a gentleman and would be treated as such but he refused to explain himself further the master of the company being sent for and examined touching the said wilson said the young man had engaged with him at birmingham about six months ago but never would take his salary that he had behaved so well in his private character as to acquire the respect and goodwill of all his acquaintance and that the public owned his merit as an actor was altogether extraordinaryafter all i fancy he will turn out to be a runaway prentice from londonthe manager offered to bail him for any sum provided he would give his word and honour that he would keep the peace but the young gentleman was on his high ropes and would by no means lay himself under any restrictions on the other hand hopeful was equally obstinate till at length the mayor declared that if they both refused to be bound over he would immediately commit wilson as a vagrant to hard labour i own i was much pleased with jerys behaviour on this occasion he said that rather than mr wilson should be treated in such an ignominious manner he would give his word and honour to prosecute the affair no further while they remained at gloucesterwilson thanked him for his generous manner of proceeding and was discharged on our return to our lodgings my nephew explained the whole mystery and i own i was exceedingly incensedliddy being questioned on the subject and very severely reproached by that wildcat my sister tabby first swooned away then dissolving in a flood of tears confessed all the particulars of the correspondence at the same time giving up three letters which was all she had received from her admirer the last which jery intercepted i send you inclosed and when you have read it i dare say you wont wonder at the progress the writer had made in the heart of a simple girl utterly unacquainted with the characters of mankind thinking it was high time to remove her from such a dangerous connexion i carried her off the very next day to bristol but the poor creature was so frightened and fluttered by our threats and expostulations that she fell sick the fourth day after our arrival at clifton and continued so ill for a whole week that her life was despaired of it was not till yesterday that dr rigge declared her out of danger you cannot imagine what i have suffered partly from the indiscretion of this poor child but much more from the fear of losing her entirely this air is intolerably cold and the place quite solitaryi never go down to the well without returning lowspirited for there i meet with half a dozen poor emaciated creatures with ghostly looks in the last stage of a consumption who have made shift to linger through the winter like so many exotic plants languishing in a hothouse but in all appearance will drop into their graves before the sun has warmth enough to mitigate the rigour of this ungenial springif you think the bathwater will be of any service to me i will go thither so soon as my niece can bear the motion of the coach tell barns i am obliged to him for his advice but dont choose to follow it if davis voluntarily offers to give up the farm the other shall have it but i will not begin at this time of day to distress my tenants because they are unfortunate and cannot make regular payments i wonder that barns should think me capable of such oppressionas for higgins the fellow is a notorious poacher to be sure and an impudent rascal to set his snares in my own paddock but i suppose he thought he had some right especially in my absence to partake of what nature seems to have intended for common useyou may threaten him in my name as much as you please and if he repeats the offence let me know it before you have recourse to justicei know you are a great sportsman and oblige many of your friends i need not tell you to make use of my grounds but it may be necessary to hint that i am more afraid of my fowlingpiece than of my game when you can spare two or three brace of partridges send them over by the stagecoach and tell gwyllim that she forgot to pack up my flannel and wide shoes in the trunkmaili shall trouble you as usual from time to time till at last i suppose you will be tired of corresponding with  your assured friend m bramble clifton april        to miss lydia melford  miss willis has pronounced my doomyou are going away dear miss melfordyou are going to be removed i know not whither what shall i do which way shall i turn for consolation i know not what i sayall night long have i been tossed in a sea of doubts and fears uncertainty and distraction without being able to connect my thoughts much less to form any consistent plan of conducti was even tempted to wish that i had never seen you or that you had been less amiable or less compassionate to your poor wilson and yet it would be detestable ingratitude in me to form such a wish considering how much i am indebted to your goodness and the ineffable pleasure i have derived from your indulgence and approbationgood god i never heard your name mentioned without emotion the most distant prospect of being admitted to your company filled my whole soul with a kind of pleasing alarm as the time approached my heart beat with redoubled force and every nerve thrilled with a transport of expectation but when i found myself actually in your presencewhen i heard you speakwhen i saw you smile when i beheld your charming eyes turned favourably upon me my breast was filled with such tumults of delight as wholly deprived me of the power of utterance and wrapt me in a delirium of joyencouraged by your sweetness of temper and affability i ventured to describe the feelings of my hearteven then you did not check my presumptionyou pitied my sufferings and gave me leave to hope you put a favourableperhaps too favourable a construction on my appearancecertain it is i am no player

miss liddy for heavens sake contrive if possible some means of letting me speak to you before you leave gloucester otherwise i know not what willbut i begin to rave againi will endeavour to bear this trial with fortitudewhile i am capable of reflecting upon your tenderness and truth i surely have no cause to despaira cloud hangs over me and there is a dreadful weight upon my spirits while you stay in this place i shall continually hover about your lodgings as the parted soul is said to linger about the grave where its mortal comfort liesi know if it is in your power you will task your

jesus college oxon  hot well april     dear phillips  i give mansel credit for his invention in propagating the report that i had a quarrel with a mountebanks merry andrew at gloucester but i have too much respect for every appendage of wit to quarrel even with the lowest buffoonery and therefore i hope mansel and i shall always be good friends i cannot however approve of his drowning my poor dog ponto on purpose to convert ovids pleonasm into a punning epitaphdeerant quoque littora ponto for that he threw him into the isis when it was so high and impetuous with no other view than to kill the fleas is an excuse that will not hold waterbut i leave poor ponto to his fate and hope providence will take care to accommodate mansel with a drier death  as there is nothing that can be called company at the well i am here in a state of absolute rustication this however gives me leisure to observe the singularities in my uncles character which seems to have interested your curiosity the truth is his disposition and mine which like oil and vinegar repelled one another at first have now begun to mix by dint of being beat up together i was once apt to believe him a complete cynic and that nothing but the necessity of his occasions could compel him to get within the pale of societyi am now of another opinion i think his peevishness arises partly from bodily pain and partly from a natural excess of mental sensibility for i suppose the mind as well as the body is in some cases endued with a morbid excess of sensation  i was tother day much diverted with a conversation that passed in the pumproom betwixt him and the famous dr ln who is come to ply at the well for patients my uncle was complaining of the stink occasioned by the vast quantity of mud and slime which the river leaves at low ebb under the windows of the pumproom he observed that the exhalations arising from such a nuisance could not but be prejudicial to the weak lungs of many consumptive patients who came to drink the water the doctor overhearing this remark made up to him and assured him he was mistaken he said people in general were so misled by vulgar prejudices that philosophy was hardly sufficient to undeceive them then humming thrice he assumed a most ridiculous solemnity of aspect and entered into a learned investigation of the nature of stink he observed that stink or stench meant no more than a strong impression on the olfactory nerves and might be applied to substances of the most opposite qualities that in the dutch language stinken signifies the most agreeable perfume as well as the most fetid odour as appears in van vloudels translation of horace in that beautiful ode quis multa gracilis cthe words fiquidis perfusus odoribus he translates van civet  moschata gestinken that individuals differed toto coelo in their opinion of smells which indeed was altogether as arbitrary as the opinion of beauty that the french were pleased with the putrid effluvia of animal food and so were the hottentots in africa and the savages in greenland and that the negroes on the coast of senegal would not touch fish till it was rotten strong presumptions in favour of what is generally called stink as those nations are in a state of nature undebauched by luxury unseduced by whim and caprice that he had reason to believe the stercoraceous flavour condemned by prejudice as a stink was in fact most agreeable to the organs of smelling for that every person who pretended to nauseate the smell of anothers excretions snuffed up his own with particular complacency for the truth of which he appealed to all the ladies and gentlemen then present he said the inhabitants of madrid and edinburgh found particular satisfaction in breathing their own atmosphere which was always impregnated with stercoraceous effluvia that the learned dr b in his treatise on the four digestions explains in what manner the volatile effluvia from the intestines stimulate and promote the operations of the animal economy he affirmed the last grand duke of tuscany of the medicis family who refined upon sensuality with the spirit of a philosopher was so delighted with that odour that he caused the essence of ordure to be extracted and used it as the most delicious perfume that he himself the doctor when he happened to be lowspirited or fatigued with business found immediate relief and uncommon satisfaction from hanging over the stale contents of a closestool while his servant stirred it about under his nose nor was this effect to be wondered at when we consider that this substance abounds with the selfsame volatile salts that are so greedily smelled to by the most delicate invalids after they have been extracted and sublimed by the chemistsby this time the company began to hold their noses but the doctor without taking the least notice of this signal proceeded to shew that many fetid substances were not only agreeable but salutary such as assa foetida and other medicinal gums resins roots and vegetables over and above burnt feathers tanpits candlesnuffs c in short he used many learned arguments to persuade his audience out of their senses and from stench made a transition to filth which he affirmed was also a mistaken idea in as much as objects so called were no other than certain modifications of matter consisting of the same principles that enter into the composition of all created essences whatever they may be that in the filthiest production of nature a philosopher considered nothing but the earth water salt and air of which it was compounded that for his own part he had no more objections to drinking the dirtiest ditchwater than he had to a glass of water from the hot well provided he was assured there was nothing poisonous in the concrete then addressing himself to my uncle sir said he you seem to be of a dropsical habit and probably will soon have a confirmed ascites if i should be present when you are tapped i will give you a convincing proof of what i assert by drinking without hesitation the water that comes out of your abdomenthe ladies made wry faces at this declaration and my uncle changing colour told him he did not desire any such proof of his philosophy but i should be glad to know said he what makes you think i am of a dropsical habit sir i beg pardon replied the doctor i perceive your ancles are swelled and you seem to have the facies leucophlegmatica perhaps indeed your disorder may be oedematous or gouty or it may be the lues venerea if you have any reason to flatter yourself it is this last sir i will undertake to cure you with three small pills even if the disease should have attained its utmost inveteracy sir it is an arcanum which i have discovered and prepared with infinite laboursir i have lately cured a woman in bristola common prostitute sir who had got all the worst symptoms of the disorder such as nodi tophi and gummata verruca cristoe galli and a serpiginous eruption or rather a pocky itch all over her body by the time she had taken the second pill sir by heaven she was as smooth as my hand and the third made her sound and as fresh as a new born infant sir cried my uncle peevishly i have no reason to flatter myself that my disorder comes within the efficacy of your nostrum but this patient you talk of may not be so sound at bottom as you imagine i cant possibly be mistaken rejoined the philosopher for i have had communication with her three timesi always ascertain my cures in that manner at this remark all the ladies retired to another corner of the room and some of them began to spitas to my uncle though he was ruffled at first by the doctors saying he was dropsical he could not help smiling at this ridiculous confession and i suppose with a view to punish this original told him there was a wart upon his nose that looked a little suspicious i dont pretend to be a judge of those matters said he but i understand that warts are often produced by the distemper and that one upon your nose seems to have taken possession of the very keystone of the bridge which i hope is in no danger of falling ln seemed a little confounded at this remark and assured him it was nothing but a common excrescence of the cuticula but that the bones were all sound below for the truth of this assertion he appealed to the touch desiring he would feel the part my uncle said it was a matter of such delicacy to meddle with a gentlemans nose that he declined the officeupon which the doctor turning to me intreated me to do him that favour i complied with his request and handled it so roughly that he sneezed and the tears ran down his cheeks to the no small entertainment of the company and particularly of my uncle who burst out alaughing for the first time since i have been with him and took notice that the part seemed to be very tender sir cried the doctor it is naturally a tender part but to remove all possibility of doubt i will take off the wart this very night  so saying he bowed with great solemnity all round and retired to his own lodgings where he applied a caustic to the wart but it spread in such a manner as to produce a considerable inflammation attended with an enormous swelling so that when he next appeared his whole face was overshadowed by this tremendous nozzle and the rueful eagerness with which he explained this unlucky accident was ludicrous beyond all descriptioni was much pleased with meeting the original of a character which you and i have often laughed at in description and what surprises me very much i find the features in the picture which has been drawn for him rather softened than overcharged  as i have something else to say and this letter has run to an unconscionable length i shall now give you a little respite and trouble you again by the very first post i wish you would take it in your head to retaliate these double strokes upon  yours always j melford     to sir watkin phillips of jesus college oxon  hot well april  0  dear knight  i now sit down to execute the threat in the tail of my last the truth is i am big with the secret and long to be delivered it relates to my guardian who you know is at present our principal object in view  tother day i thought i had detected him in such a state of frailty as would but ill become his years and character there is a decent sort of woman not disagreeable in her person that comes to the well with a poor emaciated child far gone in a consumption i had caught my uncles eyes several times directed to this person with a very suspicious expression in them and every time he saw himself observed he hastily withdrew them with evident marks of confusioni resolved to watch him more narrowly and saw him speaking to her privately in a corner of the walk at length going down to the well one day i met her half way up the hill to clifton and could not help suspecting she was going to our lodgings by appointment as it was about one oclock the hour when my sister and i are generally at the pumproomthis notion exciting my curiosity i returned by a backway and got unperceived into my own chamber which is contiguous to my uncles apartment sure enough the woman was introduced but not into his bedchamber he gave her audience in a parlour so that i was obliged to shift my station to another room where however there was a small chink in the partition through which i could perceive what passed my uncle though a little lame rose up when she came in and setting a chair for her desired she would sit down then he asked if she would take a dish of chocolate which she declined with much acknowledgment after a short pause he said in a croaking tone of voice which confounded me not a little madam i am truly concerned for your misfortunes and if this trifle can be of any service to you i beg you will accept it without ceremony so saying he put a bit of paper into her hand which she opening with great trepidation exclaimed in an extacy twenty pounds oh sir and sinking down upon a settee fainted awayfrightened at this fit and i suppose afraid of calling for assistance lest her situation should give rise to unfavourable conjectures he ran about the room in distraction making frightful grimaces and at length had recollection enough to throw a little water in her face by which application she was brought to herself but then her feeling took another turn she shed a flood of tears and cried aloud i know not who you are but sureworthy sirgenerous sirthe distress of me and my poor dying childoh if the widows prayersif the orphans tears of gratitude can ought availgracious providenceblessingsshower down eternal blessingshere she was interrupted by my uncle who muttered in a voice still more and more discordant for heavens sake be quiet madamconsiderthe people of the housesdeath cant youall this time she was struggling to throw herself on her knees while he seizing her by the wrists endeavoured to seat her upon the settee saying pritheegood nowhold your tongueat that instant who should burst intothe room but our aunt tabby of all antiquated maidens the most diabolically capriciousever prying into other peoples affairs she had seen the woman enter and followed her to the door where she stood listening but probably could hear nothing distinctly except my uncles last exclamation at which she bounded into the parlour in a violent rage that dyed the tip of her nose of a purple huefy upon you matt cried she what doings are these to disgrace your own character and disparage your familythen snatching the bank note out of the strangers hand she went onhow now twenty poundshere is temptation with a witnessgoodwoman go about your businessbrother brother i know not which most to admire your concupissins or your extravagancegood god exclaimed the poor woman shall a worthy gentlemans character suffer for an action that does honour to humanity by this time uncles indignation was effectually roused his face grew pale his teeth chattered and his eyes flashedsister cried he in a voice like thunder i vow to god your impertinence is exceedingly provoking with these words he took her by the hand and opening the door of communication thrust her into the chamber where i stood so affected by the scene that the tears ran down my cheeks observing these marks of emotion i dont wonder said she to see you concerned at the backslidings of so near a relation a man of his years and infirmities these are fine doings trulythis is a rare example set by a guardian for the benefit of his pupilsmonstrous incongruous sophisticali thought it was but an act of justice to set her to rights and therefore explained the mystery but she would not be undeceived what said she would you go for to offer for to arguefy me out of my senses didnt i hear him whispering to her to hold her tongue didnt i see her in tears didnt i see him struggling to throw her upon the couch 0 filthy hideous abominable child child talk not to me of charitywho gives twenty pounds in charitybut you are a striplingyou know nothing of the world besides charity begins at hometwenty pounds would buy me a complete suit of flowered silk trimmings and all in short i quitted the room my contempt for her and my respect for her brother being increased in the same proportion i have since been informed that the person whom my uncle so generously relieved is the widow of an ensign who has nothing to depend upon but the pension of fifteen pounds a year the people of the wellhouse give her an excellent character she lodges in a garret and works very hard at plain work to support her daughter who is dying of a consumption i must own to my shame i feel a strong inclination to follow my uncles example in relieving this poor widow but betwixt friends i am afraid of being detected in a weakness that might entail the ridicule of the company upon  dear phillips yours always j melford  direct your next to me at bath and remember me to all our fellowjesuits     to dr lewis  hot well april  0  i understand your hint there are mysteries in physic as well as in religion which we of the profane have no right to investigatea man must not presume to use his reason unless he has studied the categories and can chop logic by mode and figurebetween friends i think every man of tolerable parts ought at my time of day to be both physician and lawyer as far as his own constitution and property are concerned for my own part i have had an hospital these fourteen years within myself and studied my own case with the most painful attention consequently may be supposed to know something of the matter although i have not taken regular courses of physiology et cetera et cetera in short i have for some time been of opinion no offence dear doctor that the sum of all your medical discoveries amounts to this that the more you study the less you knowi have read all that has been written on the hot wells and what i can collect from the whole is that the water contains nothing but a little salt and calcarious earth mixed in such inconsiderable proportion as can have very little if any effect on the animal economy this being the case i think the man deserves to be fitted with a cap and bells who for such a paultry advantage as this spring affords sacrifices his precious time which might be employed in taking more effectual remedies and exposes himself to the dirt the stench the chilling blasts and perpetual rains that render this place to me intolerable if these waters from a small degree of astringency are of some service in the diabetes diarrhoea and night sweats when the secretions are too much increased must not they do harm in the same proportion where the humours are obstructed as in the asthma scurvy gout and dropsynow we talk of the dropsy here is a strange fantastical oddity one of your brethren who harangues every day in the pumproom as if he was hired to give lectures on all subjects whatsoeveri know not what to make of himsometimes he makes shrewd remarks at other times he talks like the greatest simpleton in naturehe has read a great deal but without method or judgment and digested nothing he believes every thing he has read especially if it has any thing of the marvellous in it and his conversation is a surprizing hotchpotch of erudition and extravagance he told me tother day with great confidence that my case was dropsical or as he called it leucophlegmatic a sure sign that his want of experience is equal to his presumptionfor you know there is nothing analogous to the dropsy in my disorderi wish those impertinent fellows with their ricketty understandings would keep their advice for those that ask it dropsy indeed sure i have not lived to the age of fiftyfive and had such experience of my own disorder and consulted you and other eminent physicians so often and so long to be undeceived by such abut without all doubt the man is mad and therefore what he says is of no consequence i had yesterday a visit from higgins who came hither under the terror of your threats and brought me in a present a brace of hares which he owned he took in my ground and i could not persuade the fellow that he did wrong or that i would ever prosecute him for poachingi must desire you will wink hard at the practices of this rascallion otherwise i shall be plagued with his presents which cost me more than they are worthif i could wonder at any thing fitzowen does i should be surprized at his assurance in desiring you to solicit my vote for him at the next election for the county for him who opposed me on the like occasion with the most illiberal competition you may tell him civilly that i beg to be excused direct your next for me at bath whither i propose to remove tomorrow not only on my own account but for the sake of my niece liddy who is like to relapse the poor creature fell into a fit yesterday while i was cheapening a pair of spectacles with a jewpedlar i am afraid there is something still lurking in that little heart of hers which i hope a change of objects will remove let me know what you think of this halfwitted doctors impertinent ridiculous and absurd notion of my disorderso far from being dropsical i am as lank in the belly as a greyhound and by measuring my ancle with a packthread i find the swelling subsides every day from such doctors good lord deliver usi have not yet taken any lodgings in bath because there we can be accommodated at a minutes warning and i shall choose for myselfi need not say your directions for drinking and bathing will be agreeable to  dear lewis yours ever mat bramble  ps i forgot to tell you that my right ancle pits a symptom as i take it of its being oedematous not leucophlegmatic     to miss letty willis at gloucester  hot well april     my dear letty  i did not intend to trouble you again till we should be settled at bath but having the occasion of jarvis i could not let it slip especially as i have something extraordinary to communicate o my dear companion what shall i tell you for several days past there was a jewlooking man that plied at the wells with a box of spectacles and he always eyed me so earnestly that i began to be very uneasy at last he came to our lodgings at clifton and lingered about the door as if he wanted to speak to somebodyi was seized with an odd kind of fluttering and begged win to throw herself in his way but the poor girl has weak nerves and was afraid of his beard my uncle having occasion for new glasses called him up stairs and was trying a pair of spectacles when the man advancing to me said in a whispero gracious what dye think he saidi am wilson his features struck me that very moment it was wilson sure enough but so disguised that it would have been impossible to know him if my heart had not assisted in the discovery i was so surprised and so frightened that i fainted away but soon recovered and found myself supported by him on the chair while my uncle was running about the room with the spectacles on his nose calling for help i had no opportunity to speak to him but looks were sufficiently expressive he was payed for his glasses and went away then i told win who he was and sent her after him to the pumproom where she spoke to him and begged him in my name to withdraw from the place that he might not incur the suspicion of my uncle or my brother if he did not want to see me die of terror and vexation the poor youth declared with tears in his eyes that he had something extraordinary to communicate and asked if she would deliver a letter to me but this she absolutely refused by my orderfinding her obstinate in her refusal he desired she would tell me that he was no longer a player but a gentleman in which character he would very soon avow his passion for me without fear of censure or reproachnay he even discovered his name and family which to my great grief the simple girl forgot in the confusion occasioned by her being seen talking to him by my brother who stopt her on the road and asked what business she had with that rascally jew she pretended she was cheapening a stayhook but was thrown into such a quandary that she forgot the most material part of the information and when she came home went into an hysteric fit of laughing this transaction happened three days ago during which he has not appeared so that i suppose he has gone dear letty you see how fortune takes pleasure in persecuting your poor friend if you should see him at gloucesteror if you have seen him and know his real name and family pray keep me no longer in suspenceand yet if he is under no obligation to keep himself longer concealed and has a real affection for me i should hope he will in a little time declare himself to my relations sure if there is nothing unsuitable in the match they wont be so cruel as to thwart my inclinationso what happiness would then be my portion i cant help indulging the thought and pleasing my fancy with such agreeable ideas which after all perhaps will never be realizedbut why should i despair who knows what will happenwe set out for bath tomorrow and i am almost sorry for it as i begin to be in love with solitude and this is a charming romantic place the air is so pure the downs are so agreeable the furz in full blossom the ground enamelled with daisies and primroses and cowslips all the trees bursting into leaves and the hedges already clothed with their vernal livery the mountains covered with flocks of sheep and tender bleating wanton lambkins playing frisking and skipping from side to side the groves resound with the notes of blackbird thrush and linnet and all night long sweet philomel pours forth her ravishingly delightful song then for variety we go down to the nymph of bristol spring where the company is assembled before dinner so good natured so free so easy and there we drink the water so clear so pure so mild so charmingly maukish there the fun is so chearful and reviving the weather so soft the walk so agreeable the prospect so amusing and the ships and boats going up and down the river close under the windows of the pumproom afford such an enchanting variety of moving pictures as require a much abler pen than mine to describe to make this place a perfect paradise to me nothing is wanting but an agreeable companion and sincere friend such as my dear miss willis hath been and i hope still will be to her ever faithful  lydia melford  direct for me still under cover to win and jarvis will take care to convey it safe adieu     to sir watkin phillips of jesus college oxon  bath april     dear phillips  you have indeed reason to be surprised that i should have concealed my correspondence with miss blackerby from you to whom i disclosed all my other connexions of that nature but the truth is i never dreamed of any such commerce till your last informed me that it had produced something which could not be much longer concealed it is a lucky circumstance however that her reputation will not suffer any detriment but rather derive advantage from the discovery which will prove at least that it is not quite so rotten as most people imaginedfor my own part i declare to you in all the sincerity of friendship that far from having any amorous intercourse with the object in question i never had the least acquaintance with her person but if she is really in the condition you describe i suspect mansel to be at the bottom of the whole his visits to that shrine were no secret and this attachment added to some good offices which you know he has done me since i left almamater give me a right to believe him capable of saddling me with this scandal when my back was turnednevertheless if my name can be of any service to him he is welcome to make use of it and if the woman should be abandoned enough to swear his banding to me i must beg the favour of you to compound with the parish i shall pay the penalty without repining and you will be so good as to draw upon me immediately for the sum requiredon this occasion i act by the advice of my uncle who says i shall have goodluck if i pass through life without being obliged to make many more compositions of the same kind the old gentleman told me last night with great goodhumour that betwixt the age of twenty and forty he had been obliged to provide for nine bastards sworn to him by women whom he never sawmr brambles character which seems to interest you greatly opens and improves upon me every day his singularities afford a rich mine of entertainment his understanding so far as i can judge is well cultivated his observations on life are equally just pertinent and uncommon he affects misanthropy in order to conceal the sensibility of a heart which is tender even to a degree of weakness this delicacy of feeling or soreness of the mind makes him timorous and fearful but then he is afraid of nothing so much as of dishonour and although he is exceedingly cautious of giving offence he will fire at the least hint of insolence or illbreedingrespectable as he is upon the whole i cant help being sometimes diverted by his little distresses which provoke him to let fly the shafts of his satire keen and penetrating as the arrows of teucerour aunt tabitha acts upon him as a perpetual grindstoneshe is in all respects a striking contrast to her brotherbut i reserve her portrait for another occasion  three days ago we came hither from the hot well and took possession of the first floor of a lodginghouse on the south parade a situation which my uncle chose for its being near the bath and remote from the noise of carriages he was scarce warm in the lodgings when he called for his nightcap his wide shoes and flannel and declared himself invested with the gout in his right foot though i believe it had as yet reached no farther than his imagination it was not long before he had reason to repent his premature declaration for our aunt tabitha found means to make such a clamour and confusion before the flannels could be produced from the trunk that one would have imagined the house was on fire all this time uncle sat boiling with impatience biting his fingers throwing up his eyes and muttering ejaculations at length he burst into a kind of convulsive laugh after which he hummed a song and when the hurricane was over exclaimed blessed be god for all things this however was but the beginning of his troubles mrs tabithas favourite dog chowder having paid his compliments to a female turnspit of his own species in the kitchen involved himself in a quarrel with no fewer than five rivals who set upon him at once and drove him up stairs to the dining room door with hideous noise there our aunt and her woman taking arms in his defence joined the concert which became truly diabolical this fray being with difficulty suppressed by the intervention of our own footman and the cookmaid of the house the squire had just opened his mouth to expostulate with tabby when the townwaits in the passage below struck up their music if music it may be called with such a sudden burst of sound as made him start and stare with marks of indignation and disquiet he had recollection enough to send his servant with some money to silence those noisy intruders and they were immediately dismissed though not without some opposition on the part of tabitha who thought it but reasonable that he should have more music for his money scarce had he settled this knotty point when a strange kind of thumping and bouncing was heard right overhead in the second story so loud and violent as to shake the whole building i own i was exceedingly provoked at this new alarm and before my uncle had time to express himself on the subject i ran up stairs to see what was the matter finding the roomdoor open i entered without ceremony and perceived an object which i can not now recollect without laughing to excessit was a dancing master with his scholar in the act of teaching the master was blind of one eye and lame of one foot and led about the room his pupil who seemed to be about the age of threescore stooped mortally was tall rawboned hardfavoured with a woollen nightcap on his head and he had stript off his coat that he might be more nimble in his motionsfinding himself intruded upon by a person he did not know he forthwith girded himself with a long iron sword and advancing to me with a peremptory air pronounced in a true hibernian accent mister what dye callum by my saoul and conscience i am very glad to sea you if you are after coming in the way of friendship and indeed and indeed now i believe you are my friend sure enough gra though i never had the honour to sea your face before my dear for becaase you come like a friend without any ceremony at all at alli told him the nature of my visit would not admit of ceremony that i was come to desire he would make less noise as there was a sick gentleman below whom he had no right to disturb with such preposterous doings why lookye now young gentleman replied this original perhaps upon another occasion i might shivilly request you to explain the maining of that hard word prepasterous but theres a time for all things honeyso saying he passed me with great agility and running down stairs found our footman at the diningroom door of whom he demanded admittance to pay his respects to the stranger as the fellow did not think proper to refuse the request of such a formidable figure he was immediately introduced and addressed himself to my uncle in these words your humble servant good sirim not so prepasterous as your son calls it but i know the rules of shivilityim a poor knight of ireland my name is sir ulic mackilligut of the county of galway being your fellowlodger im come to pay my respects and to welcome you to the south parade and to offer my best services to you and your good lady and your pretty daughter and even to the young gentleman your son though he thinks me a prepasterous fellowyou must know i am to have the honour to open a ball next door tomorrow with lady mac manus and being rusted in my dancing i was refreshing my memory with a little exercise but if i had known there was a sick person below by christ i would have sooner danced a hornpipe upon my own head than walk the softest minuet over yoursmy uncle who was not a little startled at his first appearance received his compliment with great complacency insisted upon his being seated thanked him for the honour of his visit and reprimanded me for my abrupt expostulation with a gentleman of his rank and character thus tutored i asked pardon of the knight who forthwith starting up embraced me so close that i could hardly breathe and assured me he loved me as his own soul at length recollecting his nightcap he pulled it off in some confusion and with his baldpate uncovered made a thousand apologies to the ladies as he retiredat that instant the abbey bells began to ring so loud that we could not hear one another speak and this peal as we afterwards learned was for the honour of mr bullock an eminent cowkeeper of tottenham who had just arrived at bath to drink the waters for indigestion mr bramble had not time to make his remarks upon the agreeable nature of this serenade before his ears were saluted with another concert that interested him more nearly two negroes belonging to a creole gentleman who lodged in the same house taking their station at a window in the staircase about ten feet from our diningroom door began to practise upon the frenchhorn and being in the very first rudiments of execution produced such discordant sounds as might have discomposed the organs of an ass you may guess what effect they had upon the irritable nerves of uncle who with the most admirable expression of splenetic surprize in his countenance sent his man to silence these dreadful blasts and desire the musicians to practise in some other place as they had no right to stand there and disturb all the lodgers in the house those sable performers far from taking the hint and withdrawing treated the messenger with great insolence bidding him carry his compliments to their master colonel rigworm who would give him a proper answer and a good drubbing into the bargain in the mean time they continued their noise and even endeavoured to make it more disagreeable laughing between whiles at the thoughts of being able to torment their betters with impunity our squire incensed at the additional insult immediately dispatched the servant with his compliments to colonel rigworm requesting that he would order his blacks to be quiet as the noise they made was altogether intolerableto this message the creole colonel replied that his horns had a right to sound on a common staircase that there they should play for his diversion and that those who did not like the noise might look for lodgings elsewhere mr bramble no sooner received this reply than his eyes began to glisten his face grew pale and his teeth chattered after a moments pause he slipt on his shoes without speaking a word or seeming to feel any further disturbance from the gout in his toes then snatching his cane he opened the door and proceeded to the place where the black trumpeters were posted there without further hesitation he began to belabour them both and exerted himself with such astonishing vigour and agility that both their heads and horns were broken in a twinkling and they ran howling down stairs to their masters parlourdoor the squire following them half way called aloud that the colonel might hear him go rascals and tell your master what i have done if he thinks himself injured he knows where to come for satisfaction as for you this is but an earnest of what you shall receive if ever you presume to blow a horn again here while i stay in the house so saying he retired to his apartment in expectation of hearing from the west indian but the colonel prudently declined any farther prosecution of the dispute my sister liddy was frighted into a fit from which she was no sooner recovered than mrs tabitha began a lecture upon patience which her brother interrupted with a most significant grin true sister god increase my patience and your discretion i wonder added he what sort of sonata we are to expect from this overture in which the devil that presides over horrid sounds hath given us such variations of discordthe trampling of porters the creaking and crashing of trunks the snarling of curs the scolding of women the squeaking and squalling of fiddles and hautboys out of tune the bouncing of the irish baronet overhead and the bursting belching and brattling of the frenchhorns in the passage not to mention the harmonious peal that still thunders from the abbey steeple succeeding one another without interruption like the different parts of the same concert have given me such an idea of what a poor invalid has to expect in this temple dedicated to silence and repose that i shall certainly shift my quarters tomorrow and endeavour to effectuate my retreat before sir ulic opens the ball with my lady mac manus a conjunction that bodes me no good this intimation was by no means agreeable to mrs tabitha whose ears were not quite so delicate as those of her brothershe said it would be great folly to move from such agreeable lodgings the moment they were comfortably settled she wondered he should be such an enemy to music and mirth she heard no noise but of his own making it was impossible to manage a family in dumbshew he might harp as long as he pleased upon her scolding but she never scolded except for his advantage but he would never be satisfied even thof she should sweat blood and water in his servicei have a great notion that our aunt who is now declining into the most desperate state of celibacy had formed some design upon the heart of sir ulic mackilligut which she feared might be frustrated by our abrupt departure from these lodgings her brother eyeing her askance pardon me sister said he i should be a savage indeed were i insensible of my own felicity in having such a mild complaisant goodhumoured and considerate companion and housekeeper but as i have got a weak head and my sense of hearing is painfully acute before i have recourse to plugs of wool and cotton ill try whether i cant find another lodging where i shall have more quiet and less music he accordingly dispatched his man upon this service and next day he found a small house in milshamstreet which he hires by the week here at least we enjoy convenience and quiet within doors as much as tabbys temper will allow but the squire still complains of flying pains in the stomach and head for which he bathes and drinks the waters he is not so bad however but that he goes in person to the pump the rooms and the coffeehouses where he picks up continual food for ridicule and satire if i can glean any thing for your amusement either from his observation or my own you shall have it freely though i am afraid it will poorly compensate the trouble of reading these tedious insipid letters of  dear phillips yours always j melford     to dr lewis bath april    dear doctor  if i did not know that the exercise of your profession has habituated you to the hearing of complaints i should make a conscience of troubling you with my correspondence which may be truly called the lamentations of matthew bramble yet i cannot help thinking i have some right to discharge the overflowings of my spleen upon you whose province it is to remove those disorders that occasioned it and let me tell you it is no small alleviation of my grievances that i have a sensible friend to whom i can communicate my crusty humours which by retention would grow intolerably acrimonious  you must know i find nothing but disappointment at bath which is so altered that i can scarce believe it is the same place that i frequented about thirty years ago methinks i hear you say altered it is without all doubt but then it is altered for the better a truth which perhaps you would own without hesitation if you yourself was not altered for the worse the reflection may for aught i know be just the inconveniences which i overlooked in the highday of health will naturally strike with exaggerated impression on the irritable nerves of an invalid surprised by premature old age and shattered with longsufferingbut i believe you will not deny that this place which nature and providence seem to have intended as a resource from distemper and disquiet is become the very centre of racket and dissipation instead of that peace tranquillity and case so necessary to those who labour under bad health weak nerves and irregular spirits here we have nothing but noise tumult and hurry with the fatigue and slavery of maintaining a ceremonial more stiff formal and oppressive than the etiquette of a german elector a national hospital it may be but one would imagine that none but lunatics are admitted and truly i will give you leave to call me so if i stay much longer at bathbut i shall take another opportunity to explain my sentiments at greater length on this subjecti was impatient to see the boasted improvements in architecture for which the upper parts of the town have been so much celebrated and tother day i made a circuit of all the new buildings the square though irregular is on the whole pretty well laid out spacious open and airy and in my opinion by far the most wholesome and agreeable situation in bath especially the upper side of it but the avenues to it are mean dirty dangerous and indirect its communication with the baths is through the yard of an inn where the poor trembling valetudinarian is carried in a chair betwixt the heels of a double row of horses wincing under the currycombs of grooms and postilions over and above the hazard of being obstructed or overturned by the carriages which are continually making their exit or their entrancei suppose after some chairmen shall have been maimed and a few lives lost by those accidents the corporation will think in earnest about providing a more safe and commodious passage the circus is a pretty bauble contrived for shew and looks like vespasians amphitheatre turned outside in if we consider it in point of magnificence the great number of small doors belonging to the separate houses the inconsiderable height of the different orders the affected ornaments of the architrave which are both childish and misplaced and the areas projecting into the street surrounded with iron rails destroy a good part of its effect upon the eye and perhaps we shall find it still more defective if we view it in the light of convenience the figure of each separate dwellinghouse being the segment of a circle must spoil the symmetry of the rooms by contracting them towards the street windows and leaving a larger sweep in the space behind if instead of the areas and iron rails which seem to be of very little use there had been a corridore with arcades all round as in coventgarden the appearance of the whole would have been more magnificent and striking those arcades would have afforded an agreeable covered walk and sheltered the poor chairmen and their carriages from the rain which is here almost perpetual at present the chairs stand soaking in the open street from morning to night till they become so many boxes of wet leather for the benefit of the gouty and rheumatic who are transported in them from place to place indeed this is a shocking inconvenience that extends over the whole city and i am persuaded it produces infinite mischief to the delicate and infirm even the close chairs contrived for the sick by standing in the open air have their frize linings impregnated like so many spunges with the moisture of the atmosphere and those cases of cold vapour must give a charming check to the perspiration of a patient piping hot from the bath with all his pores wide open  but to return to the circus it is inconvenient from its situation at so great a distance from all the markets baths and places of public entertainment the only entrance to it through gaystreet is so difficult steep and slippery that in wet weather it must be exceedingly dangerous both for those that ride in carriages and those that walk afoot and when the street is covered with snow as it was for fifteen days successively this very winter i dont see how any individual could go either up or down without the most imminent hazard of broken bones in blowing weather i am told most of the houses in this hill are smothered with smoke forced down the chimneys by the gusts of wind reverberated from the hill behind which i apprehend likewise must render the atmosphere here more humid and unwholesome than it is in the square below for the clouds formed by the constant evaporation from the baths and rivers in the bottom will in their ascent this way be first attracted and detained by the hill that rises close behind the circus and load the air with a perpetual succession of vapours this point however may be easily ascertained by means of an hygrometer or a paper of salt of tartar exposed to the action of the atmosphere the same artist who planned the circus has likewise projected a crescent when that is finished we shall probably have a star and those who are living thirty years hence may perhaps see all the signs of the zodiac exhibited in architecture at bath these however fantastical are still designs that denote some ingenuity and knowledge in the architect but the rage of building has laid hold on such a number of adventurers that one sees new houses starting up in every outlet and every corner of bath contrived without judgment executed without solidity and stuck together with so little regard to plan and propriety that the different lines of the new rows and buildings interfere with and intersect one another in every different angle of conjunction they look like the wreck of streets and squares disjointed by an earthquake which hath broken the ground into a variety of holes and hillocks or as if some gothic devil had stuffed them altogether in a bag and left them to stand higgledy piggledy just as chance directed what sort of a monster bath will become in a few years with those growing excrescences may be easily conceived but the want of beauty and proportion is not the worst effect of these new mansions they are built so slight with the soft crumbling stone found in this neighbourhood that i shall never sleep quietly in one of them when it blowed as the sailors say a capfull of wind and i am persuaded that my hind roger williams or any man of equal strength would be able to push his foot through the strongest part of their walls without any great exertion of his muscles all these absurdities arise from the general tide of luxury which hath overspread the nation and swept away all even the very dregs of the people every upstart of fortune harnessed in the trappings of the mode presents himself at bath as in the very focus of observationclerks and factors from the east indies loaded with the spoil of plundered provinces planters negrodrivers and hucksters from our american plantations enriched they know not how agents commissaries and contractors who have fattened in two successive wars on the blood of the nation usurers brokers and jobbers of every kind men of low birth and no breeding have found themselves suddenly translated into a state of affluence unknown to former ages and no wonder that their brains should be intoxicated with pride vanity and presumption knowing no other criterion of greatness but the ostentation of wealth they discharge their affluence without taste or conduct through every channel of the most absurd extravagance and all of them hurry to bath because here without any further qualification they can mingle with the princes and nobles of the land even the wives and daughters of low tradesmen who like shovelnosed sharks prey upon the blubber of those uncouth whales of fortune are infected with the same rage of displaying their importance and the slightest indisposition serves them for a pretext to insist upon being conveyed to bath where they may hobble countrydances and cotillons among lordlings squires counsellors and clergy these delicate creatures from bedfordbury butcherrow crutchedfriers and botolphlane cannot breathe in the gross air of the lower town or conform to the vulgar rules of a common lodginghouse the husband therefore must provide an entire house or elegant apartments in the new buildings such is the composition of what is called the fashionable company at bath where a very inconsiderable proportion of genteel people are lost in a mob of impudent plebeians who have neither understanding nor judgment nor the least idea of propriety and decorum and seem to enjoy nothing so much as an opportunity of insulting their betters  thus the number of people and the number of houses continue to increase and this will ever be the case till the streams that swell this irresistible torrent of folly and extravagance shall either be exhausted or turned into other channels by incidents and events which i do not pretend to foresee this i own is a subject on which i cannot write with any degree of patience for the mob is a monster i never could abide either in its head tail midriff or members i detest the whole of it as a mass of ignorance presumption malice and brutality and in this term of reprobation i include without respect of rank station or quality all those of both sexes who affect its manners and court its society  but i have written till my fingers are crampt and my nausea begins to returnby your advice i sent to london a few days ago for half a pound of gengzeng though i doubt much whether that which comes from america is equally efficacious with what is brought from the east indies some years ago a friend of mine paid sixteen guineas for two ounces of it and in six months after it was sold in the same shop for five shillings the pound in short we live in a vile world of fraud and sophistication so that i know nothing of equal value with the genuine friendship of a sensible man a rare jewel which i cannot help thinking myself in possession of while i repeat the old declaration that i am as usual  dear lewis your affectionate m bramble  after having been agitated in a short hurricane on my first arrival i have taken a small house in milshamstreet where i am tolerably well lodged for five guineas a week i was yesterday at the pumproom and drank about a pint of water which seems to agree with my stomach and tomorrow morning i shall bathe for the first time so that in a few posts you may expect farther trouble mean while i am glad to find that the inoculation has succeeded so well with poor joyce and that her face will be but little marked if my friend sir thomas was a single man i would not trust such a handsome wench in his family but as i have recommended her in a particular manner to the protection of lady g who is one of the best women in the world she may go thither without hesitation as soon as she is quite recovered and fit for servicelet her mother have money to provide her with necessaries and she may ride behind her brother on bucks but you must lay strong injunctions on jack to take particular care of the trusty old veteran who has faithfully earned his present ease by his past services     to miss willis at gloucester bath april    my dearest companion  the pleasure i received from yours which came to hand yesterday is not to be expressed love and friendship are without doubt charming passions which absence serves only to heighten and improve your kind present of the garnet bracelets i shall keep as carefully as i preserve my own life and i beg you will accept in return my hearthousewife with the tortoiseshell memorandumbook as a trifling pledge of my unalterable affection  bath is to me a new worldall is gayety goodhumour and diversion the eye is continually entertained with the splendour of dress and equipage and the ear with the sound of coaches chairs and other carriages the merry bells ring round from morn till night then we are welcomed by the citywaits in our own lodgings we have music in the pumproom every morning cotillons every forenoon in the rooms balls twice a week and concerts every other night besides private assemblies and parties without numberas soon as we were settled in lodgings we were visited by the master of the ceremonies a pretty little gentleman so sweet so fine so civil and polite that in our country he might pass for the prince of wales then he talks so charmingly both in verse and prose that you would be delighted to hear him discourse for you must know he is a great writer and has got five tragedies ready for the stage he did us the favour to dine with us by my uncles invitation and next day squired my aunt and me to every part of bath which to be sure is an earthly paradise the square the circus and the parades put you in mind of the sumptuous palaces represented in prints and pictures and the new buildings such as princesrow harlequinsrow bladudsrow and twenty other rows look like so many enchanted castles raised on hanging terraces  at eight in the morning we go in dishabille to the pumproom which is crowded like a welsh fair and there you see the highest quality and the lowest trades folks jostling each other without ceremony hailfellow wellmet the noise of the music playing in the gallery the heat and flavour of such a crowd and the hum and buz of their conversation gave me the headach and vertigo the first day but afterwards all these things became familiar and even agreeableright under the pumproom windows is the kings bath a huge cistern where you see the patients up to their necks in hot water the ladies wear jackets and petticoats of brown linen with chip hats in which they fix their handkerchiefs to wipe the sweat from their faces but truly whether it is owing to the steam that surrounds them or the heat of the water or the nature of the dress or to all these causes together they look so flushed and so frightful that i always turn my eyes another waymy aunt who says every person of fashion should make her appearance in the bath as well as in the abbey church contrived a cap with cherrycoloured ribbons to suit her complexion and obliged win to attend her yesterday morning in the water but really her eyes were so red that they made mine water as i viewed her from the pumproom and as for poor win who wore a hat trimmed with blue what betwixt her wan complexion and her fear she looked like the ghost of some pale maiden who had drowned herself for love when she came out of the bath she took assafoetida drops and was fluttered all day so that we could hardly keep her from going into hysterics but her mistress says it will do her good and poor win curtsies with the tears in her eyes for my part i content myself with drinking about half a pint of the water every morning  the pumper with his wife and servant attend within a bar and the glasses of different sizes stand ranged in order before them so you have nothing to do but to point at that which you choose and it is filled immediately hot and sparkling from the pump it is the only hot water i could ever drink without being sickfar from having that effect it is rather agreeable to the taste grateful to the stomach and reviving to the spirits you cannot imagine what wonderful cures it performsmy uncle began with it the other day but he made wry faces in drinking and im afraid he will leave it offthe first day we came to bath he fell into a violent passion beat two blackamoors and i was afraid he would have fought with their master but the stranger proved a peaceable man to be sure the gout had got into his head as my aunt observed but i believe his passion drove it away for he has been remarkably well ever since it is a thousand pities he should ever be troubled with that ugly distemper for when he is free from pain he is the best tempered man upon earth so gentle so generous so charitable that every body loves him and so good to me in particular that i shall never be able to shew the deep sense i have of his tenderness and affection  hard by the pumproom is a coffeehouse for the ladies but my aunt says young girls are not admitted insomuch as the conversation turns upon politics scandal philosophy and other subjects above our capacity but we are allowed to accompany them to the booksellers shops which are charming places of resort where we read novels plays pamphlets and newspapers for so small a subscription as a crown a quarter and in these offices of intelligence as my brother calls them all the reports of the day and all the private transactions of the bath are first entered and discussed from the booksellers shop we make a tour through the milliners and toymen and commonly stop at mr gills the pastrycook to take a jelly a tart or a small bason of vermicelli there is moreover another place of entertainment on the other side of the water opposite to the grove to which the company cross over in a boatit is called springgarden a sweet retreat laid out in walks and ponds and parterres of flowers and there is a longroom for breakfasting and dancing as the situation is low and damp and the season has been remarkably wet my uncle wont suffer me to go thither lest i should catch cold but my aunt says it is all a vulgar prejudice and to be sure a great many gentlemen and ladies of ireland frequent the place without seeming to be the worse for it they say dancing at springgardens when the air is moist is recommended to them as an excellent cure for the rheumatism i have been twice at the play where notwithstanding the excellence of the performers the gayety of the company and the decorations of the theatre which are very fine i could not help reflecting with a sigh upon our poor homely representations at gloucesterbut this in confidence to my dear willisyou know my heart and will excuse its weakness  after all the great scenes of entertainment at bath are the two public rooms where the company meet alternately every evening they are spacious lofty and when lighted up appear very striking they are generally crowded with welldressed people who drink tea in separate parties play at cards walk or sit and chat together just as they are disposed twice aweek there is a ball the expence of which is defrayed by a voluntary subscription among the gentlemen and every subscriber has three tickets i was there friday last with my aunt under the care of my brother who is a subscriber and sir ulic mackilligut recommended his nephew captain o donaghan to me as a partner but jery excused himself by saying i had got the headach and indeed it was really so though i cant imagine how he knew it the place was so hot and the smell so different from what we are used to in the country that i was quite feverish when we came away aunt says it is the effect of a vulgar constitution reared among woods and mountains and that as i become accustomed to genteel company it will wear offsir ulic was very complaisant made her a great many highflown compliments and when we retired handed her with great ceremony to her chair the captain i believe would have done me the same favour but my brother seeing him advance took me under his arm and wished him good night the captain is a pretty man to be sure tall and strait and well made with lightgrey eyes and a roman nose but there is a certain boldness in his look and manner that puts one out of countenancebut i am afraid i have put you out of all patience with this long unconnected scrawl which i shall therefore conclude with assuring you that neither bath nor london nor all the diversions of life shall ever be able to efface the idea of my dear letty from the heart of her ever affectionate  lydia melford     to mrs mary jones at brambletonhall  dear molly jones  heaving got a frank i now return your fever which i received by mr higgins at the hot well together with the stockings which his wife footed for me but now they are of no survice no

mortally afraid and flustered all day and afterwards made believe that i had got the heddick but mistress said if i didnt go i should take a dose of bumtaffy and so remembering how it worked mrs gwyllim a pennorth i chose rather to go again with her into the bath and then i met with an axident i dropt my petticoat and could not get it up from the bottombut what did that signify they mought laff but they could see nothing for i was up to the sin in water to be sure it threw me into such a gumbustion that i know not what i said nor what i did nor how they got me out and rapt me in a blanketmrs tabitha scoulded a little when we got home but she knows as i know whats what ah laud help youthere is sir yury micligut of balnaclinch in the cunty of kallowayi took down the name from his gentleman mr 0 frizzle and he has got an estate of fifteen hundred a yeari am sure he is both rich and generousbut you nose molly i was always famous for keeping secrets and so he was very safe in trusting me with his flegm for mistress which to be sure is very honourable for mr o frizzle assures me he values not her portion a brass varthingand indeed whats poor ten thousand pounds to a baron knight of his fortune and truly i told mr 0 frizzle that was all she had trust toas for john thomas hes a morass fellori vow i thought he would a fit with mr 0 frizzle because he axed me to dance with him at spring gardenbut god he knows i have no thoughts eyther of wan or tother  as for house news the worst is chowder has fallen off greatly from his stomickhe cats nothing but white meats and not much of that and wheezes and seems to be much bloated the doctors think he is threatened with a dropsyparson marrofat who has got the same disorder finds great benefit from the waters but chowder seems to like them no better than the squire and mistress says if his case dont take a favourable turn she will sartinly carry him to abergany to drink goats wheyto be sure the poor dear honymil is lost for want of axercise for which reason she intends to give him an airing once aday upon the downs in a postchaisei have already made very creditable connexions in this here place where to be sure we have the very squintasense of satietymrs patcher my lady kilmacullocks woman and i are sworn sisters she has shewn me all her secrets and learned me to wash gaze and refrash rusty silks and bumbeseens by boiling them with winegar chamberlye and stale beer my short sack and apron luck as good as new from the shop and my pumpydoor as fresh as a rose by the help of turtlewaterbut this is all greek and latten to you mollyif we should come to abergany youll be within a days ride of us and then we shall see wan another please godif not remember me in your prayers as i shall do by you in mine and take care of my kitten and give my kind sarvice to sall and this is all at present from your beloved friend and sarvent  w jenkins bath april        to mrs gwyllim housekeeper at brambletonhall  i am astonished that dr lewis should take upon him to give away alderney without my privity and concurrantswhat signifies my brothers order my brother is little better than noncompush he would give away the shirt off his back and the teeth out of his head nay as for that matter he would have ruinated the family with his ridiculous charities if it had not been for my four quarterswhat between his willfullness and his waste his trumps and his frenzy i lead the life of an indented slave alderney gave four gallons aday ever since the calf was sent to market there is so much milk out of my dairy and the press must stand still but i wont loose a cheese pairing and the milk shall be made good if the sarvents should go without butter if they must needs have butter let them make it of sheeps milk but then my wool will suffer for want of grace so that i must be a loser on all sides well patience is like a stout welsh poney it bears a great deal and trots a great way but it will tire at the long run before its long perhaps i may shew matt that i was not born to be the household drudge to my dying daygwyn rites from crickhowel that the price of flannel is fallen threefarthings an ell and thats another good penny out of my pocket when i go to market to sell my commodity stinks but when i want to buy the commonest thing the owner pricks it up under my nose and it cant be had for love nor moneyi think everything runs cross at brambletonhallyou say the gander has broke the eggs which is a phinumenon i dont understand for when the fox carried off the old goose last year he took her place and hatched the eggs and partected the goslings like a tender parentthen you tell me the thunder has soured two barrels of beer in the seller but how the thunder should get there when the seller was doublelocked i cant comprehend howsomever i wont have the beer thrown out till i see it with my own eyes perhaps it will recoverat least it will serve for vinegar to the servantsyou may leave off the fires in my brothers chamber and mine as it is unsartain when we returni hope gwyllim youll take care there is no waste and have an eye to the maids and keep them to their spinning i think they may go very well without beer in hot weatherit serves only to inflame the blood and set them agog after the men water will make them fair and keep them cool and tamperit dont forget to put up in the portmantel that cums with williams along with my ridinghabit hat and feather the viol of purl water and the tincktur for my stomach being as how i am much troubled with flutterencies this is all at present from  yours tabitha bramble bath april        to dr lewis  dear dick  i have done with the waters therefore your advice comes a day too late i grant that physic is no mystery of your making i know it is a mystery in its own nature and like other mysteries requires a strong gulp of faith to make it go downtwo days ago i went into the kings bath by the advice of our friend ch in order to clear the strainer of the skin for the benefit of a free perspiration and the first object that saluted my eye was a child full of scrophulous ulcers carried in the arms of one of the guides under the very noses of the bathers i was so shocked at the sight that i retired immediately with indignation and disgustsuppose the matter of those ulcers floating on the water comes in contact with my skin when the pores are all open i would ask you what must be the consequencegood heaven the very thought makes my blood run cold we know not what sores may be running into the water while we are bathing and what sort of matter we may thus imbibe the kingsevil the scurvy the cancer and the pox and no doubt the heat will render the virus the more volatile and penetrating to purify myself from all such contamination i went to the duke of kingstons private bath and there i was almost suffocated for want of free air the place was so small and the steam so stifling  after all if the intention is no more than to wash the skin i am convinced that simple element is more effectual than any water impregnated with salt and iron which being astringent will certainly contract the pores and leave a kind of crust upon the surface of the body but i am now as much afraid of drinking as of bathing for after a long conversation with the doctor about the construction of the pump and the cistern it is very far from being clear with me that the patients in the pumproom dont swallow the scourings of the bathers i cant help suspecting that there is or may be some regurgitation from the bath into the cistern of the pump in that case what a delicate beveridge is every day quaffed by the drinkers medicated with the sweat and dirt and dandriff and the abominable discharges of various kinds from twenty different diseased bodies parboiling in the kettle below in order to avoid this filthy composition i had recourse to the spring that supplies the private baths on the abbeygreen but i at once perceived something extraordinary in the taste and smell and upon inquiry i find that the roman baths in this quarter were found covered by an old burying ground belonging to the abbey through which in all probability the water drains in its passage so that as we drink the decoction of living bodies at the pumproom we swallow the strainings of rotten bones and carcasses at the private bath i vow to god the very idea turns my stomach determined as i am against any farther use of the bath waters this consideration would give me little disturbance if i could find any thing more pure or less pernicious to quench my thirst but although the natural springs of excellent water are seen gushing spontaneous on every side from the hills that surround us the inhabitants in general make use of wellwater so impregnated with nitre or alum or some other villainous mineral that it is equally ungrateful to the taste and mischievous to the constitution it must be owned indeed that here in milshamstreet we have a precarious and scanty supply from the hill which is collected in an open bason in the circus liable to be defiled with dead dogs cats rats and every species of nastiness which the rascally populace may throw into it from mere wantonness and brutality well there is no nation that drinks so hoggishly as the english  what passes for wine among us is not the juice of the grape it is an adulterous mixture brewed up of nauseous ingredients by dunces who are bunglers in the art of poisonmaking and yet we and our forefathers are and have been poisoned by this cursed drench without taste or flavourthe only genuine and wholesome beveridge in england is london porter and dorchester tablebeer but as for your ale and your gin your cyder and your perry and all the trashy family of made wines i detest them as infernal compositions contrived for the destruction of the human speciesbut what have i to do with the human species except a very few friends i care not if the whole was  heark ye lewis my misanthropy increases every daythe longer i live i find the folly and the fraud of mankind grow more and more intolerablei wish i had not come from brambletonhall after having lived in solitude so long i cannot bear the hurry and impertinence of the multitude besides every thing is sophisticated in these crowded places snares are laid for our lives in every thing we cat or drink the very air we breathe is loaded with contagion we cannot even sleep without risque of infection i say infectionthis place is the rendezvous of the diseasedyou wont deny that many diseases are infectious even the consumption itself is highly infectious when a person dies of it in italy the bed and bedding are destroyed the other furniture is exposed to the weather and the apartment whitewashed before it is occupied by any other living soul youll allow that nothing receives infection sooner or retains it longer than blankets featherbeds and matrassessdeath how do i know what miserable objects have been stewing in the bed where i now liei wonder dick you did not put me in mind of sending for my own matrassesbut if i had not been an ass i should not have needed a remembrancerthere is always some plaguy reflection that rises up in judgment against me and ruffles my spiritstherefore let us change the subject  i have other reasons for abridging my stay at bathyou know sister tabbys complexionif mrs tabitha bramble had been of any other race i should certainly have considered her as the most but the truth is she has found means to interest my affection or rather she is beholden to the force of prejudice commonly called the ties of blood well this amiable maiden has actually commenced a flirting correspondence with an irish baronet of sixtyfive his name is sir ulic mackilligut he is said to be much out at elbows and i believe has received false intelligence with respect to her fortune be that as it may the connexion is exceedingly ridiculous and begins already to excite whispers for my part i have no intention to dispute her freeagency though i shall fall upon some expedient to undeceive her paramour as to the point which he has principally in view but i dont think her conduct is a proper example for liddy who has also attracted the notice of some coxcombs in the rooms and jery tells me he suspects a strapping fellow the knights nephew of some design upon the girls heart i shall therefore keep a strict eye over her aunt and her and even shift the scene if i find the matter grow more seriousyou perceive what an agreeable task it must be to a man of my kidney to have the cure of such souls as thesebut hold you shall not have another peevish word till the next occasion from  yours matt bramble bath april        to sir watkin phillips of jesus college oxon  dear knight  i think those people are unreasonable who complain that bath is a contracted circle in which the same dull scenes perpetually revolve without variationi am on the contrary amazed to find so small a place so crowded with entertainment and variety london itself can hardly exhibit one species of diversion to which we have not something analogous at bath over and above those singular advantages that are peculiar to the place here for example a man has daily opportunities of seeing the most remarkable characters of the community he sees them in their natural attitudes and true colours descended from their pedestals and divested of their formal draperies undisguised by art and affectationhere we have ministers of state judges generals bishops projectors philosophers wits poets players chemists fiddlers and buffoons if he makes any considerable stay in the place he is sure of meeting with some particular friend whom he did not expect to see and to me there is nothing more agreeable than such casual reencounters another entertainment peculiar to bath arises from the general mixture of all degrees assembled in our public rooms without distinction of rank or fortune this is what my uncle reprobates as a monstrous jumble of heterogeneous principles a vile mob of noise and impertinence without decency or subordination but this chaos is to me a source of infinite amusement  i was extremely diverted last ballnight to see the master of the ceremonies leading with great solemnity to the upper end of the room an antiquated abigail dressed in her ladys castclothes whom he i suppose mistook for some countess just arrived at the bath the ball was opened by a scotch lord with a mulatto heiress from st christophers and the gay colonel tinsel danced all the evening with the daughter of an eminent tinman from the borough of southwark yesterday morning at the pumproom i saw a brokenwinded wapping landlady squeeze through a circle of peers to salute her brandymerchant who stood by the window propped upon crutches and a paralytic attorney of shoelane in shuffling up to the bar kicked the shins of the chancellor of england while his lordship in a cut bob drank a glass of water at the pump i cannot account for my being pleased with these incidents any other way than by saying they are truly ridiculous in their own nature and serve to heighten the humour in the farce of life which i am determined to enjoy as long as i can  those follies that move my uncles spleen excite my laughter he is as tender as a man without a skin who cannot bear the slightest touch without flinching what tickles another would give him torment and yet he has what we may call lucid intervals when he is remarkably facetiousindeed i never knew a hypochondriac so apt to be infected with goodhumour he is the most risible misanthrope i ever met with a lucky joke or any ludicrous incident will set him alaughing immoderately even in one of his most gloomy paroxysms and when the laugh is over he will curse his own imbecility in conversing with strangers he betrays no marks of disquiethe is splenetic with his familiars only and not even with them while they keep his attention employed but when his spirits are not exerted externally they seem to recoil and prey upon himselfhe has renounced the waters with execration but he begins to find a more efficacious and certainly a much more palatable remedy in the pleasures of society he has discovered some old friends among the invalids of bath and in particular renewed his acquaintance with the celebrated james quin who certainly did not come here to drink water you cannot doubt but that i had the strongest curiosity to know this original and it was gratified by mr bramble who has had him twice at our house to dinner  so far as i am able to judge quins character is rather more respectable than it has been generally represented his bon mots are in every witlings mouth but many of them have a rank flavour which one would be apt to think was derived from a natural grossness of idea i suspect however that justice has not been done the author by the collectors of those quiniana who have let the best of them slip through their fingers and only retained such as were suited to the taste and organs of the multitude how far he may relax in his hours of jollity i cannot pretend to say but his general conversation is conducted by the nicest rules of propriety and mr james quin is certainly one of the best bred men in the kingdom he is not only a most agreeable companion but as i am credibly informed a very honest man highly susceptible of friendship warm steady and even generous in his attachments disdaining flattery and incapable of meanness and dissimulation were i to judge however from quins eye alone i should take him to be proud insolent and cruel there is something remarkably severe and forbidding in his aspect and i have been told he was ever disposed to insult his inferiors and dependantsperhaps that report has influenced my opinion of his looksyou know we are the fools of prejudice howsoever that may be i have as yet seen nothing but his favourable side and my uncle who frequently confers with him in a corner declares he is one of the most sensible men he ever knewhe seems to have a reciprocal regard for old squaretoes whom he calls by the familiar name of matthew and often reminds of their old tavernadventures on the other hand matthews eyes sparkle whenever quin makes his appearancelet him be never so jarring and discordant quin puts him in tune and like treble and bass in the same concert they make excellent music together tother day the conversation turning upon shakespeare i could not help saying with some emotion that i would give an hundred guineas to see mr quin act the part of falstaff upon which turning to me with a smile and i would give a thousand young gentleman said he that i could gratify your longing my uncle and he are perfectly agreed in their estimate of life which quin says would stink in his nostrils if he did not steep it in claret  i want to see this phenomenon in his cups and have almost prevailed upon uncle to give him a small turtle at the bear in the mean time i must entertain you with an incident that seems to confirm the judgment of those two cynic philosophers i took the liberty to differ in opinion from mr bramble when he observed that the mixture of people in the entertainments of this place was destructive of all order and urbanity that it rendered the plebeians insufferably arrogant and troublesome and vulgarized the deportment and sentiments of those who moved in the upper spheres of life he said such a preposterous coalition would bring us into contempt with all our neighbours and was worse in fact than debasing the gold coin of the nation i argued on the contrary that those plebeians who discovered such eagerness to imitate the dress and equipage of their superiors would likewise in time adopt their maxims and their manners be polished by their conversation and refined by their example but when i appealed to mr quin and asked if he did not think that such an unreserved mixture would improve the whole mass yes said he as a plate of marmalade would improve a pan of sirreverence  i owned i was not much conversant in highlife but i had seen what were called polite assemblies in london and elsewhere that those of bath seemed to be as decent as any and that upon the whole the individuals that composed it would not be found deficient in good manners and decorum but let us have recourse to experience said ijack holder who was intended for a parson has succeeded to an estate of two thousand a year by the death of his elder brother he is now at the bath driving about in a phaeton and four with french horns he has treated with turtle and claret at all the taverns in bath and bristol till his guests are gorged with good chear he has bought a dozen suits of fine clothes by the advice of the master of the ceremonies under whose tuition he has entered himself he has lost hundreds at billiards to sharpers and taken one of the nymphs of avonstreet into keeping but finding all these channels insufficient to drain him of his current cash his counsellor has engaged him to give a general teadrinking tomorrow at wiltshires room in order to give it the more eclat every table is to be furnished with sweetmeats and nosegays which however are not to be touched till notice is given by the ringing of a bell and then the ladies may help themselves without restriction this will be no bad way of trying the companys breeding  i will abide by that experiment cried my uncle and if i could find a place to stand secure without the vortex of the tumult which i know will ensue i would certainly go thither and enjoy the scene quin proposed that we should take our station in the musicgallery and we took his advice holder had got thither before us with his horns perdue but we were admitted the teadrinking passed as usual and the company having risen from the tables were sauntering in groupes in expectation of the signal for attack when the bell beginning to ring they flew with eagerness to the dessert and the whole place was instantly in commotion there was nothing but justling scrambling pulling snatching struggling scolding and screaming the nosegays were torn from one anothers hands and bosoms the glasses and china went to wreck the tables and floors were strewed with comfits some cried some swore and the tropes and figures of billingsgate were used without reserve in all their native zest and flavour nor were those flowers of rhetoric unattended with significant gesticulation some snapped their fingers some forked them out some clapped their hands and some their backsides at length they fairly proceeded to pulling caps and every thing seemed to presage a general battle when holder ordered his horns to sound a charge with a view to animate the combatants and inflame the contest but this manoeuvre produced an effect quite contrary to what he expected it was a note of reproach that roused them to an immediate sense of their disgraceful situation they were ashamed of their absurd deportment and suddenly desisted they gathered up their caps ruffles and handkerchiefs and great part of them retired in silent mortification  quin laughed at this adventure but my uncles delicacy was hurt he hung his head in manifest chagrin and seemed to repine at the triumph of his judgmentindeed his victory was more complete than he imagined for as we afterwards learned the two amazons who singularized themselves most in the action did not come from the purlieus of puddledock but from the courtly neighbourhood of st jamess palace one was a baroness and the other a wealthy knights dowagermy uncle spoke not a word till we had made our retreat good to the coffeehouse where taking off his hat and wiping his forehead i bless god said he that mrs tabitha bramble did not take the field today i would pit her for a cool hundred cried quin against the best shakebag of the whole main the truth is nothing could have kept her at home but the accident of her having taken physic before she knew the nature of the entertainment she has been for some days furbishing up an old suit of black velvet to make her appearance as sir ulics partner at the next ball  i have much to say of this amiable kinswoman but she has not been properly introduced to your acquaintance she is remarkably civil to mr quin of whose sarcastic humour she seems to stand in awe but her caution is no match for her impertinence mr gwynn said she the other day i was once vastly entertained with your playing the ghost of gimlet at drurylane when you rose up through the stage with a white face and red eyes and spoke of quails upon the frightful porcofinedo pray spout a little the ghost of gimlet madam said quin with a glance of ineffable disdain the ghost of gimlet is laid never to rise again insensible of this check she proceeded well to be sure you looked and talked so like a real ghost and then the cock crowed so natural i wonder how you could teach him to crow so exact in the very nick of time but i suppose hes gameant he game mr gwynn dunghill madamwell dunghill or not dunghill he has got such a clear countertenor that i wish i had such another at brambletonhall to wake the maids of a morning do you know where i could find one of his brood probably in the workhouse at st giless parish madam but i protest i know not his particular mew my uncle frying with vexation cried good god sister how you talk i have told you twenty times that this gentlemans name is not gwynnhoity toity brother mine she replied no offence i hopegwynn is an honorable name of true old british extractioni thought the gentleman had been come of mrs helen gwynn who was of his own profession and if so be that were the case he might be of king charless breed and have royal blood in his veinsno madam answered quin with great solemnity my mother was not a whore of such distinctiontrue it is i am sometimes tempted to believe myself of royal descent for my inclinations are often arbitraryif i was an absolute prince at this instant i believe i should send for the head of your cook in a chargershe has committed felony on the person of that john dory which is mangled in a cruel manner and even presented without sauceo tempora o mores  this goodhumoured sally turned the conversation into a less disagreeable channelbut lest you should think my scribble as tedious as mrs tabbys clack i shall not add another word but that i am as usual  yours j melford bath april  0     to dr lewis  dear lewis  i received your bill upon wiltshire which was punctually honoured but as i dont choose to keep so much cash by me in a common lodging house i have deposited   0l in the bank of bath and shall take their bills for it in london when i leave this place where the season draws to an endyou must know that now being afoot i am resolved to give liddy a glimpse of london she is one of the best hearted creatures i ever knew and gains upon my affection every dayas for tabby i have dropt such hints to the irish baronet concerning her fortune as i make no doubt will cool the ardour of his addresses then her pride will take the alarm and the rancour of stale maidenhood being chafed we shall hear nothing but slander and abuse of sir ulic mackilligutthis rupture i foresee will facilitate our departure from bath where at present tabby seems to enjoy herself with peculiar satisfaction for my part i detest it so much that i should not have been able to stay so long in the place if i had not discovered some old friends whose conversation alleviates my disgustgoing to the coffeehouse one forenoon i could not help contemplating the company with equal surprize and compassionwe consisted of thirteen individuals seven lamed by the gout rheumatism or palsy three maimed by accident and the rest either deaf or blind one hobbled another hopped a third dragged his legs after him like a wounded snake a fourth straddled betwixt a pair of long crutches like the mummy of a felon hanging in chains a fifth was bent into a horizontal position like a mounted telescope shoved in by a couple of chairmen and a sixth was the bust of a man set upright in a wheel machine which the waiter moved from place to place  being struck with some of their faces i consulted the subscriptionbook and perceiving the names of several old friends began to consider the groupe with more attention at length i discovered rearadmiral balderick the companion of my youth whom i had not seen since he was appointed lieutenant of the severn he was metamorphosed into an old man with a wooden leg and a weatherbeaten face which appeared the more ancient from his grey locks that were truly venerablesitting down at the table where he was reading a newspaper i gazed at him for some minutes with a mixture of pleasure and regret which made my heart gush with tenderness then taking him by the hand ah sam said i forty years ago i little thoughti was too much moved to proceed an old friend sure enough cried he squeezing my hand and surveying me eagerly through his glasses i know the looming of the vessel though she has been hard strained since we parted but i cant heave up the namethe moment i told him who i was he exclaimed ha matt my old fellow cruizer still afloat and starting up hugged me in his arms his transport however boded me no good for in saluting me he thrust the spring of his spectacles into my eye and at the same time set his wooden stump upon my gouty toe an attack that made me shed tears in sad earnestafter the hurry of our recognition was over he pointed out two of our common friends in the room the bust was what remained of colonel cockril who had lost the use of his limbs in making an american campaign and the telescope proved to be my college chum sir reginald bently who with his new title and unexpected inheritance commenced foxhunter without having served his apprenticeship to the mystery and in consequence of following the hounds through a river was seized with an inflammation of his bowels which has contracted him into his present attitude  our former correspondence was forthwith renewed with the most hearty expressions of mutual goodwill and as we had met so unexpectedly we agreed to dine together that very day at the tavern my friend quin being luckily unengaged obliged us with his company and truly this the most happy day i have passed these twenty years you and i lewis having been always together never tasted friendship in this high gout contracted from long absence i cannot express the half of what i felt at this casual meeting of three or four companions who had been so long separated and so roughly treated by the storms of life it was a renovation of youth a kind of resuscitation of the dead that realized those interesting dreams in which we sometimes retrieve our ancient friends from the grave perhaps my enjoyment was not the less pleasing for being mixed with a strain of melancholy produced by the remembrance of past scenes that conjured up the ideas of some endearing connexions which the hand of death has actually dissolved  the spirits and good humour of the company seemed to triumph over the wreck of their constitutions they had even philosophy enough to joke upon their own calamities such is the power of friendship the sovereign cordial of lifei afterwards found however that they were not without their moments and even hours of disquiet each of them apart in succeeding conferences expatiated upon his own particular grievances and they were all malcontents at bottomover and above their personal disasters they thought themselves unfortunate in the lottery of life balderick complained that all the recompence he had received for his long and hard service was the halfpay of a rearadmiral the colonel was mortified to see himself overtopped by upstart generals some of whom he had once commanded and being a man of a liberal turn could ill put up with a moderate annuity for which he had sold his commission as for the baronet having run himself considerably in debt on a contested election he has been obliged to relinquish his seat in parliament and his seat in the country at the same time and put his estate to nurse but his chagrin which is the effect of his own misconduct does not affect me half so much as that of the other two who have acted honourable and distinguished parts on the great theatre and are now reduced to lead a weary life in this stewpan of idleness and insignificance they have long left off using the waters after having experienced their inefficacy the diversions of the place they are not in a condition to enjoy how then do they make shift to pass their time in the forenoon they crawl out to the rooms or the coffeehouse where they take a hand at whist or descant upon the general advertiser and their evenings they murder in private parties among peevish invalids and insipid old womenthis is the case with a good number of individuals whom nature seems to have intended for better purposes  about a dozen years ago many decent families restricted to small fortunes besides those that came hither on the score of health were tempted to settle at bath where they could then live comfortably and even make a genteel appearance at a small expence but the madness of the times has made the place too hot for them and they are now obliged to think of other migrationssome have already fled to the mountains of wales and others have retired to exeter thither no doubt they will be followed by the flood of luxury and extravagance which will drive them from place to place to the very lands end and there i suppose they will be obliged to ship themselves to some other country bath is become a mere sink of profligacy and extortion every article of housekeeping is raised to an enormous price a circumstance no longer to be wondered at when we know that every petty retainer of fortune piques himself upon keeping a table and thinks it is for the honour of his character to wink at the knavery of his servants who are in a confederacy with the marketpeople and of consequence pay whatever they demand here is now a mushroom of opulence who pays a cook seventy guineas a week for furnishing him with one meal a day this portentous frenzy is become so contagious that the very rabble and refuse of mankind are infected i have known a negrodriver from jamaica pay overnight to the master of one of the rooms sixtyfive guineas for tea and coffee to the company and leave bath next morning in such obscurity that not one of his guests had the slightest idea of his person or even made the least inquiry about his name incidents of this kind are frequent and every day teems with fresh absurdities which are too gross to make a thinking man merry  but i feel the spleen creeping on me apace and therefore will indulge you with a cessation that you may have no unnecessary cause to curse your correspondence with  dear dick yours ever mat bramble bath may       to miss laetitia willis at gloucester  my dear letty  i wrote you at great length by the post the twentysixth of last month to which i refer you for an account of our proceedings at bath and i expect your answer with impatience but having this opportunity of a private hand i send you two dozen of bath rings six of the best of which i desire you will keep for yourself and distribute the rest among the young ladies our common friends as you shall think properi dont know how you will approve of the mottoes some of them are not much to my own liking but i was obliged to take such as i could find ready manufacturedi am vexed that neither you nor i have received any further information of a certain personsure it cannot be wilful neglecto my dear willis i begin to be visited by strange fancies and to have some melancholy doubts which however it would be ungenerous to harbour without further inquirymy uncle who has made me a present of a very fine set of garnets talks of treating us with a jaunt to london which you may imagine will be highly agreeable but i like bath so well that i hope he wont think of leaving it till the season is quite over and yet betwixt friends something has happened to my aunt which will probably shorten our stay in this place  yesterday in the forenoon she went by herself to a breakfasting in one of the rooms and in half an hour returned in great agitation having chowder along with her in the chair i believe some accident must have happened to that unlucky animal which is the great source of all her troubles dear letty what a pity it is that a woman of her years and discretion should place her affection upon such an ugly illconditioned cur that snarls and snaps at every body i asked john thomas the footman who attended her what was the matter and he did nothing but grin a famous dogdoctor was sent for and undertook to cure the patient provided he might carry him home to his own house but his mistress would not part with him out of her own sightshe ordered the cook to warm cloths which she applied to his bowels with her own hand she gave up all thoughts of going to the ball in the evening and when sir ulic came to drink tea refused to be seen so that he went away to look for another partner my brother jery whistles and dances my uncle sometimes shrugs up his shoulders and sometimes bursts out alaughing my aunt sobs and scolds by turns and her woman win jenkins stares and wonders with a foolish face of curiosity and for my part i am as curious as she but ashamed to ask questions  perhaps time will discover the mystery for if it was any thing that happened in the rooms it cannot be long concealedall i know is that last night at supper miss bramble spoke very disdainfully of sir ulic mackilligut and asked her brother if he intended to keep us sweltering all the summer at bath no sister tabitha said he with an arch smile we shall retreat before the dogdays begin though i make no doubt that with a little temperance and discretion our constitutions might be kept cool enough all the year even at bath as i dont know the meaning of this insinuation i wont pretend to make any remarks upon it at present hereafter perhaps i may be able to explain it more to your satisfactionin the mean time i beg you will be punctual in your correspondence and continue to love your ever faithful  lydia melford bath may       to sir watkin phillips of jesus college oxon  so then mrs blackerbys affair has proved a false alarm and i have saved my money i wish however her declaration had not been so premature for though my being thought capable of making her a mother might have given me some credit the reputation of an intrigue with such a cracked pitcher does me no honour at all in my last i told you i had hopes of seeing quin in his hours of elevation at the tavern which is the temple of mirth and good fellowship where he as priest of comus utters the inspirations of wit and humouri have had that satisfaction i have dined with his club at the three tuns and had the honour to sit him out at half an hour past eight in the evening he was carried home with six good bottles of claret under his belt and it being then friday he gave orders that he should not be disturbed till sunday at noonyou must not imagine that this dose had any other effect upon his conversation but that of making it more extravagantly entertaininghe had lost the use of his limbs indeed several hours before we parted but he retained all his other faculties in perfection and as he gave vent to every whimsical idea as it rose i was really astonished at the brilliancy of his thoughts and the force of his expression quin is a real voluptuary in the articles of eating and drinking and so confirmed an epicure in the common acceptation of the term that he cannot put up with ordinary fare this is a point of such importance with him that he always takes upon himself the charge of catering and a man admitted to his mess is always sure of eating delicate victuals and drinking excellent winehe owns himself addicted to the delights of the stomach and often jokes upon his own sensuality but there is nothing selfish in this appetitehe finds that good chear unites good company exhilerates the spirits opens the heart banishes all restraint from conversation and promotes the happiest purposes of social life but mr james quin is not a subject to be discussed in the compass of one letter i shall therefore at present leave him to his repose and call another of a very different complexion  you desire to have further acquaintance with the person of our aunt and promise yourself much entertainment from her connexion with sir ulic mackilligut but in this hope you are baulked already that connexion is dissolved the irish baronet is an old hound that finding her carrion has quitted the scenti have already told you that mrs tabitha bramble is a maiden of fortyfive in her person she is tall rawboned aukward flatchested and stooping her complexion is sallow and freckled her eyes are not grey but greenish like those of a cat and generally inflamed her hair is of a sandy or rather dusty hue her forehead low her nose long sharp and towards the extremity always red in cool weather her lips skinny her mouth extensive her teeth straggling and loose of various colours and conformation and her long neck shrivelled into a thousand wrinklesin her temper she is proud stiff vain imperious prying malicious greedy and uncharitable in all likelihood her natural austerity has been soured by disappointment in love for her long celibacy is by no means owing to her dislike of matrimony on the contrary she has left no stone unturned to avoid the reproachful epithet of old maid  before i was born she had gone such lengths in the way of flirting with a recruiting officer that her reputation was a little singed she afterwards made advances to the curate of the parish who dropped some distant hints about the next presentation to the living which was in her brothers gift but finding that was already promised to another he flew off at a tangent and mrs tabby in revenge found means to deprive him of his cure her next lover was lieutenant of a man of war a relation of the family who did not understand the refinements of the passion and expressed no aversion to grapple with cousin tabby in the way of marriage but before matters could be properly adjusted he went out on a cruise and was killed in an engagement with a french frigate our aunt though baffled so often did not yet despair she layed all her snares for dr lewis who is the fidus achates of my uncle she even fell sick upon the occasion and prevailed with matt to interpose in her behalf with his friend but the doctor being a shy cock would not be caught with chaff and flatly rejected the proposal so that mrs tabitha was content to exert her patience once more after having endeavoured in vain to effect a rupture betwixt the two friends and now she thinks proper to be very civil to lewis who is become necessary to her in the way of his profession  these however are not the only efforts she has made towards a nearer conjunction with our sex her fortune was originally no more than a thousand pounds but she gained an accession of five hundred by the death of a sister and the lieutenant left her three hundred in his will these sums she has more than doubled by living free of all expence in her brothers house and dealing in cheese and welsh flannel the produce of his flocks and dairy at present her capital is increased to about four thousand pounds and her avarice seems to grow every day more and more rapacious but even this is not so intolerable as the perverseness of her nature which keeps the whole family in disquiet and uproar she is one of those geniuses who find some diabolical enjoyment in being dreaded and detested by their fellowcreatures  i once told my uncle i was surprised that a man of his disposition could bear such a domestic plague when it could be so easily removed the remark made him sore because it seemed to tax him with want of resolutionwrinkling up his nose and drawing down his eyebrows a young fellow said he when he first thrusts his snout into the world is apt to be surprised at many things which a man of experience knows to be ordinary and unavoidablethis precious aunt of yours is become insensibly a part of my constitutiondamn her shes a noli me tangere in my flesh which i cannot bear to be touched or tampered with i made no reply but shifted the conversation he really has an affection for this original which maintains its ground in defiance of common sense and in despite of that contempt which he must certainly feel for her character and understanding nay i am convinced that she has likewise a most virulent attachment to his person though her love never shews itself but in the shape of discontent and she persists in tormenting him out of pure tendernessthe only object within doors upon which she bestows any marks of affection in the usual stile is her dog chowder a filthy cur from newfoundland which she had in a present from the wife of a skipper in swansey one would imagine she had distinguished this beast with her favour on account of his ugliness and illnature if it was not indeed an instinctive sympathy between his disposition and her own certain it is she caresses him without ceasing and even harasses the family in the service of this cursed animal which indeed has proved the proximate cause of her breach with sir ulic mackilligut  you must know she yesterday wanted to steal a march of poor liddy and went to breakfast in the room without any other companion than her dog in expectation of meeting with the baronet who had agreed to dance with her in the eveningchowder no sooner made his appearance in the room than the master of the ceremonies incensed at his presumption ran up to drive him away and threatened him with his foot but the other seemed to despise his authority and displaying a formidable case of long white sharp teeth kept the puny monarch at baywhile he stood under some trepidation fronting his antagonist and bawling to the waiter sir ulic mackilligut came to his assistance and seeming ignorant of the connexion between this intruder and his mistress gave the former such a kick in the jaws as sent him howling to the doormrs tabitha incensed at this outrage ran after him squalling in a tone equally disagreeable while the baronet followed her on one side making apologies for his mistake and derrick on the other making remonstrances upon the rules and regulations of the place  far from being satisfied with the knights excuses she said she was sure he was no gentleman and when the master of the ceremonies offered to hand her into the chair she rapped him over the knuckles with her fan my uncles footman being still at the door she and chowder got into the same vehicle and were carried off amidst the jokes of the chairmen and other populacei had been riding out on clerkendown and happened to enter just as the fracas was overthe baronet coming up to me with an affected air of chagrin recounted the adventure at which i laughed heartily and then his countenance cleared up my dear soul said he when i saw a sort of a wild baist snarling with open mouth at the master of the ceremonies like the red cow going to devour tom thumb i could do no less than go to the assistance of the little man but i never dreamt the baist was one of mrs brambles attendantso if i had he might have made his breakfast upon derrick and welcomebut you know my dear friend how natural it is for us irishmen to blunder and to take the wrong sow by the earhowever i will confess judgment and cry her mercy and it is to be hoped a penitent sinner may be forgiven i told him that as the offence was not voluntary of his side it was to be hoped he would not find her implacable  but in truth all this concern was dissembled in his approaches of gallantry to mrs tabitha he had been misled by a mistake of at least six thousand pounds in the calculation of her fortune and in this particular he was just undeceived he therefore seized the first opportunity of incurring her displeasure decently in such a manner as would certainly annihilate the correspondence and he could not have taken a more effectual method than that of beating her dog when he presented himself at our door to pay his respects to the offended fair he was refused admittance and given to understand that he should never find her at home for the future she was not so inaccessible to derrick who came to demand satisfaction for the insult she had offered to him even in the verge of his own court she knew it was convenient to be well with the master of the ceremonies while she continued to frequent the rooms and having heard he was a poet began to be afraid of making her appearance in a ballad or lampoonshe therefore made excuses for what she had done imputing it to the flutter of her spirits and subscribed handsomely for his poems so that he was perfectly appeased and overwhelmed her with a profusion of compliment he even solicited a reconciliation with chowder which however the latter declined and he declared that if he could find a precedent in the annals of the bath which he would carefully examine for that purpose her favourite should be admitted to the next public breakfastingbut i believe she will not expose herself or him to the risque of a second disgracewho will supply the place of mackilligut in her affections i cannot foresee but nothing in the shape of man can come amiss though she is a violent churchwoman of the most intolerant zeal i believe in my conscience she would have no objection at present to treat on the score of matrimony with an anabaptist quaker or jew and even ratify the treaty at the expense of her own conversion but perhaps i think too hardly of this kinswoman who i must own is very little beholden to the good opinion of  yours j melford bath may       to dr lewis  you ask me why i dont take the air ahorseback during this fine weatherin which of the avenues of this paradise would you have me take that exercise shall i commit myself to the highroads of london or bristol to be stifled with dust or pressed to death in the midst of postchaises flyingmachines waggons and coalhorses besides the troops of fine gentlemen that take to the highway to shew their horsemanship and the coaches of fine ladies who go thither to shew their equipages shall i attempt the downs and fatigue myself to death in climbing up an eternal ascent without any hopes of reaching the summit know then i have made divers desperate leaps at those upper regions but always fell backward into this vapourpit exhausted and dispirited by those ineffectual efforts and here we poor valetudinarians pant and struggle like so many chinese gudgeons gasping in the bottom of a punchbowl by heaven it is a kind of enchantment if i do not speedily break the spell and escape i may chance to give up the ghost in this nauseous stew of corruptionit was but two nights ago that i had like to have made my public exit at a minutes warning one of my greatest weaknesses is that of suffering myself to be overruled by the opinion of people whose judgment i despisei own with shame and confusion of face that importunity of any kind i cannot resist this want of courage and constancy is an original flaw in my nature which you must have often observed with compassion if not with contempt i am afraid some of our boasted virtues maybe traced up to this defect  without further preamble i was persuaded to go to a ball on purpose to see liddy dance a minuet with a young petulant jackanapes the only son of a wealthy undertaker from london whose mother lodges in our neighbourhood and has contracted an acquaintance with tabby i sat a couple of long hours half stifled in the midst of a noisome crowd and could not help wondering that so many hundreds of those that rank as rational creatures could find entertainment in seeing a succession of insipid animals describing the same dull figure for a whole evening on an area not much bigger than a taylors shopboard if there had been any beauty grace activity magnificent dress or variety of any kind howsoever absurd to engage the attention and amuse the fancy i should not have been surprised but there was no such object it was a tiresome repetition of the same languid frivolous scene performed by actors that seemed to sleep in all their motions the continual swimming of these phantoms before my eyes gave me a swimming of the head which was also affected by the fouled air circulating through such a number of rotten human bellows i therefore retreated towards the door and stood in the passage to the next room talking to my friend quin when an end being put to the minuets the benches were removed to make way for the countrydances and the multitude rising at once the whole atmosphere was put in commotion then all of a sudden came rushing upon me an egyptian gale so impregnated with pestilential vapours that my nerves were overpowered and i dropt senseless upon the floor  you may easily conceive what a clamour and confusion this accident must have produced in such an assemblyi soon recovered however and found myself in an easy chair supported by my own peoplesister tabby in her great tenderness had put me to the torture squeezing my hand under her arm and stuffing my nose with spirit of hartshorn till the whole inside was excoriated i no sooner got home than i sent for doctor ch who assured me i needed not be alarmed for my swooning was entirely occasioned by an accidental impression of fetid effluvia upon nerves of uncommon sensibility i know not how other peoples nerves are constructed but one would imagine they must be made of very coarse materials to stand the shock of such a torrid assault it was indeed a compound of villainous smells in which the most violent stinks and the most powerful perfumes contended for the mastery imagine to yourself a high exalted essence of mingled odours arising from putrid gums imposthumated lungs sour flatulencies rank armpits sweating feet running sores and issues plasters ointments and embrocations hungarywater spirit of lavender assafoetida drops musk hartshorn and sal volatile besides a thousand frowzy steams which i could not analyse such o dick is the fragrant aether we breathe in the polite assemblies of bathsuch is the atmosphere i have exchanged for the pure elastic animating air of the welsh mountainso rus quando te aspiciami wonder what the devil possessed me  but few words are best i have taken my resolutionyou may well suppose i dont intend to entertain the company with a second exhibitioni have promised in an evil hour to proceed to london and that promise shall be performed but my stay in the metropolis shall be brief i have for the benefit of my health projected an expedition to the north which i hope will afford some agreeable pastime i have never travelled farther that way than scarborough and i think it is a reproach upon me as a british freeholder to have lived so long without making an excursion to the other side of the tweed besides i have some relations settled in yorkshire to whom it may not be improper to introduce my nephew and his sisterat present i have nothing to add but that tabby is happily disentangled from the irish baronet and that i will not fail to make you acquainted from time to time with the sequel of our adventures a mark of consideration which perhaps you would willingly dispense with in  your humble servant m bramble bath may       to sir watkin phillips of jesus college oxon  dear phillips  a few days ago we were terribly alarmed by my uncles fainting at the ballhe has been ever since cursing his own folly for going thither at the request of an impertinent woman he declares he will sooner visit a house infected with the plague than trust himself in such a nauseous spital for the future for he swears the accident was occasioned by the stench of the crowd and that he would never desire a stronger proof of our being made of very gross materials than our having withstood the annoyance by which he was so much discomposed for my part i am very thankful for the coarseness of my organs being in no danger of ever falling a sacrifice to the delicacy of my nose mr bramble is extravagantly delicate in all his sensations both of soul and body i was informed by dr lewis that he once fought a duel with an officer of the horseguards for turning aside to the parkwall on a necessary occasion when he was passing with a lady under his protection his blood rises at every instance of insolence and cruelty even where he himself is no way concerned and ingratitude makes his teeth chatter on the other hand the recital of a generous humane or grateful action never fails to draw from him tears of approbation which he is often greatly distressed to conceal  yesterday one paunceford gave tea on particular invitationthis man after having been long buffetted by adversity went abroad and fortune resolved to make him amends for her former coyness set him all at once up to the very ears in affluence he has now emerged from obscurity and blazes out in all the tinsel of the times i dont find that he is charged with any practices that the law deems dishonest or that his wealth has made him arrogant and inaccessible on the contrary he takes great pains to appear affable and gracious but they say he is remarkable for shrinking from his former friendships which were generally too plain and homespun to appear amidst his present brilliant connexions and that he seems uneasy at sight of some old benefactors whom a man of honour would take pleasure to acknowledgebe that as it may he had so effectually engaged the company at bath that when i went with my uncle to the coffeehouse in the evening there was not a soul in the room but one person seemingly in years who sat by the fire reading one of the papers mr bramble taking his station close by him there is such a crowd and confusion of chairs in the passage to simpsons said he that we could hardly get alongi wish those minions of fortune would fall upon more laudable ways of spending their moneyi suppose sir you like this kind of entertainment as little as i do i cannot say i have any great relish for such entertainments answered the other without taking his eyes off the papermr serle resumed my uncle i beg pardon for interrupting you but i cant resist the curiosity i have to know if you received a card on this occasion  the man seemed surprised at this address and made some pause as doubtful what answer he should make i know my curiosity is impertinent added my uncle but i have a particular reason for asking the favour if that be the case replied mr serle i shall gratify you without hesitation by owning that i have had no card but give me leave sir to ask in my turn what reason you think i have to expect such an invitation from the gentleman who gives tea i have my own reasons cried mr bramble with some emotion and am convinced more than ever that this paunceford is a contemptible fellow sir said the other laying down the paper i have not the honour to know you but your discourse is a little mysterious and seems to require some explanation the person you are pleased to treat so cavalierly is a gentleman of some consequence in the community and for aught you know i may also have my particular reasons for defending his characterif i was not convinced of the contrary observed the other i should not have gone so farlet me tell you sir said the stranger raising his voice you have gone too far in hazarding such reflections  here he was interrupted by my uncle who asked peevishly if he was don quixote enough at this time of day to throw down his gauntlet as champion for a man who had treated him with such ungrateful neglect for my part added he i shall never quarrel with you again upon this subject and what i have said now has been suggested as much by my regard for you as by my contempt of himmr serle then pulling off his spectacles eyed uncle very earnestly saying in a mitigated tone surely i am much obligedah mr bramble i now recollect your features though i have not seen you these many years we might have been less strangers to one another answered the squire if our correspondence had not been interrupted in consequence of a misunderstanding occasioned by this very but no mattermr serle i esteem your character and my friendship such as it is you may freely command the offer is too agreeable to be declined said he i embrace it very cordially and as the first fruits of it request that you will change this subject which with me is a matter of peculiar delicacy  my uncle owned he was in the right and the discourse took a more general turn mr serle passed the evening with us at our lodgings and appeared to be intelligent and even entertaining but his disposition was rather of a melancholy hue my uncle says he is a man of uncommon parts and unquestioned probity that his fortune which was originally small has been greatly hurt by a romantic spirit of generosity which he has often displayed even at the expence of his discretion in favour of worthless individualsthat he had rescued paunceford from the lowest distress when he was bankrupt both in means and reputationthat he had espoused his interests with a degree of enthusiasm broke with several friends and even drawn his sword against my uncle who had particular reasons for questioning the moral character of the said paunceford that without serles countenance and assistance the other never could have embraced the opportunity which has raised him to this pinnacle of wealth that paunceford in the first transports of his success had written from abroad letters to different correspondents owning his obligations to mr serle in the warmest terms of acknowledgement and declared he considered himself only as a factor for the occasions of his best friend that without doubt he had made declarations of the same nature to his benefactor himself though this last was always silent and reserved on the subject but for some years those tropes and figures of rhetoric had been disused that upon his return to england he had been lavish in his caresses to mr serle invited him to his house and pressed him to make it his own that he had overwhelmed him with general professions and affected to express the warmest regard for him in company of their common acquaintance so that every body believed his gratitude was liberal as his fortune and some went so far as to congratulate mr serle on both  all this time paunceford carefully and artfully avoided particular discussions with his old patron who had too much spirit to drop the most distant hint of balancing the account of obligation that nevertheless a man of his feelings could not but resent this shocking return for all his kindness and therefore he withdrew himself from the connexion without coming to the least explanation or speaking a syllable on the subject to any living soul so that now their correspondence is reduced to a slight salute with the hat when they chance to meet in any public place an accident that rarely happens for their walks lie different ways mr paunceford lives in a palace feeds upon dainties is arrayed in sumptuous apparel appears in all the pomp of equipage and passes his time among the nobles of the land serle lodges in stallstreet up two pair of stairs backwards walks afoot in a bathrug eats for twelve shillings aweek and drinks water as preservative against the gout and gravelmark the vicissitude paunceford once resided in a garret where he subsisted upon sheepstrotters and cowheel from which commons he was translated to the table of serle that ever abounded with goodchear until want of economy and retention reduced him to a slender annuity in his decline of years that scarce affords the bare necessaries of lifepaunceford however does him the honour to speak of him still with uncommon regard and to declare what pleasure it would give him to contribute in any shape to his convenience but you know he never fails to add hes a shy kind of a manand then such a perfect philosopher that he looks upon all superfluities with the most sovereign contempt having given you this sketch of squire paunceford i need not make any comment on his character but leave it at the mercy of your own reflection from which i dare say it will meet with as little quarter as it has found with  yours always j melford bath may  0     to mrs mary jones at brambletonhall  dear molly  we

and apron with the vite gallow manky shoes which youll find in my pillowbersarvice to saul     to sir watkin phillips bart of jesus college oxon  you are in the right dear phillips i dont expect regular answers to every letteri know a collegelife is too circumscribed to afford materials for such quick returns of communication for my part i am continually shifting the scene and surrounded with new objects some of which are striking enough i shall therefore conclude my journal for your amusement and though in all appearance it will not treat of very important or interesting particulars it may prove perhaps not altogether uninstructive and unentertaining  the music and entertainments of bath are over for this season and all our gay birds of passage have taken their flight to bristolwell tunbridge brighthelmstone scarborough harrowgate c not a soul is seen in this place but a few brokenwinded parsons waddling like so many crows along the north parade there is always a great shew of the clergy at bath none of your thin puny yellow hectic figures exhausted with abstinence and hardy study labouring under the morbi eruditorum but great overgrown dignitaries and rectors with rubicund noses and gouty ancles or broad bloated faces dragging along great swag bellies the emblems of sloth and indigestion  now we are upon the subject of parsons i must tell you a ludicrous adventure which was achieved the other day by tom eastgate whom you may remember on the foundation of queens he had been very assiduous to pin himself upon george prankley who was a gentlemancommoner of christchurch knowing the said prankley was heir to a considerable estate and would have the advowson of a good living the incumbent of which was very old and infirm he studied his passions and flattered them so effectually as to become his companion and counsellor and at last obtained of him a promise of the presentation when the living should fall prankley on his uncles death quitted oxford and made his first appearance in the fashionable world at london from whence he came lately to bath where he has been exhibiting himself among the bucks and gamesters of the place eastgate followed him hither but he should not have quitted him for a moment at his first emerging into life he ought to have known he was a fantastic foolish fickle fellow who would forget his collegeattachments the moment they ceased appealing to his senses tom met with a cold reception from his old friend and was moreover informed that he had promised the living to another man who had a vote in the county where he proposed to offer himself a candidate at the next general election he now remembered nothing of eastgate but the freedoms he had used to take with him while tom had quietly stood his butt with an eye to the benefice and those freedoms he began to repeat in commonplace sarcasms on his person and his cloth which he uttered in the public coffeehouse for the entertainment of the company but he was egregiously mistaken in giving his own wit credit for that tameness of eastgate which had been entirely owing to prudential considerations these being now removed he retorted his repartee with interest and found no great difficulty in turning the laugh upon the aggressor who losing his temper called him names and asked if he knew whom he talked to after much altercation prankley shaking his cane bid him hold his tongue otherwise he could dust his cassock for him i have no pretensions to such a valet said tom but if you should do me that office and overheat yourself i have here a good oaken towel at your service  prankley was equally incensed and confounded at this reply after a moments pause he took him aside towards die window and pointing to the clump of firs on clerkendown asked in a whisper if he had spirit enough to meet him there with a case of pistols at six oclock tomorrow morning eastgate answered in the affirmative and with a steady countenance assured him he would not fail to give him the rendezvous at the hour he mentioned so saying he retired and the challenger stayed some time in manifest agitation in the morning eastgate who knew his man and had taken his resolution went to prankleys lodgings and roused him by five oclock  the squire in all probability cursed his punctuality in his heart but he affected to talk big and having prepared his artillery overnight they crossed the water at the end of the south parade in their progress up the hill prankley often eyed the parson in hopes of perceiving some reluctance in his countenance but as no such marks appeared he attempted to intimidate him by word of mouth if these flints do their office said he ill do thy business in a few minutes i desire you will do your best replied the other for my part i come not here to trifle our lives are in the hands of god and one of us already totters on the brink of eternity this remark seemed to make some impression upon the squire who changed countenance and with a faultering accent observed that it ill became a clergyman to be concerned in quarrels and bloodshedyour insolence to me said eastgate i should have bore with patience had not you cast the most infamous reflections upon my order the honour of which i think myself in duty bound to maintain even at the expence of my hearts blood and surely it can be no crime to put out of the world a profligate wretch without any sense of principle morality or religionthou mayst take away my life cried prankley in great perturbation but dont go to murder my character what hast got no conscience my conscience is perfectly quiet replied the other and now sir we are upon the spottake your ground as near as you please prime your pistol and the lord of his infinite mercy have compassion upon your miserable soul  this ejaculation he pronounced in a loud solemn tone with his hat off and his eyes lifted up then drawing a large horsepistol he presented and put himself in a posture of action prankley took his distance and endeavoured to prime but his hand shook with such violence that he found this operation impracticablehis antagonist seeing how it was with him offered his assistance and advanced for that purpose when the poor squire exceedingly alarmed at what he had heard and seen desired the action might be deferred till next day as he had not settled his affairs i hant made my will said he my sisters are not provided for and i just now recollect an old promise which my conscience tells me i ought to performill first convince thee that im not a wretch without principle and then thou shalt have an opportunity to take my life which thou seemst to thirst after so eagerly  eastgate understood the hint and told him that one day should break no squares adding god forbid that i should be the means of hindering you from acting the part of an honest man and a dutiful brotherby virtue of this cessation they returned peaceably together prankley forthwith made out the presentation of the living and delivered it to eastgate telling him at the same time he had now settled his affairs and was ready to attend him to the firgrove but tom declared he could not think of lifting his hand against the life of so great a benefactorhe did more when they next met at the coffeehouse he asked pardon of mr prankley if in his passion he had said any thing to give him offence and the squire was so gracious as to forgive him with a cordial shake of the hand declaring that he did not like to be at variance with an old college companionnext day however he left bath abruptly and then eastgate told me all these particulars not a little pleased with the effects of his own sagacity by which he has secured a living worth   0l per annum  of my uncle i have nothing at present to say but that we set out tomorrow for london en famille he and the ladies with the maid and chowder in a coach i and the manservant ahorseback the particulars of our journey you shall have in my next provided no accident happens to prevent  yours ever j melford bath may        to dr lewis  dear dick  i shall tomorrow set out for london where i have bespoke lodgings at mrs nortons in goldensquare although i am no admirer of bath i shall leave it with regret because i must part with some old friends whom in all probability i shall never see again in the course of coffeehouse conversation i had often heard very extraordinary encomiums passed on the performances of mr t a gentleman residing in this place who paints landscapes for his amusement as i have no great confidence in the taste and judgment of coffeehouse connoisseurs and never received much pleasure from this branch of the art those general praises made no impression at all on my curiosity but at the request of a particular friend i went yesterday to see the pieces which had been so warmly commendedi must own i am no judge of painting though very fond of pictures i dont imagine that my senses would play me so false as to betray me into admiration of any thing that was very bad but true it is i have often overlooked capital beauties in pieces of extraordinary meritif i am not totally devoid of taste however this young gentleman of bath is the best landscapepainter now living i was struck with his performances in such a manner as i had never been by painting before his trees not only have a richness of foliage and warmth of colouring which delights the view but also a certain magnificence in the disposition and spirit in the expression which i cannot describe his management of the chiaro oscuro or light and shadow especially gleams of sunshine is altogether wonderful both in the contrivance and execution and he is so happy in his perspective and marking his distances at sea by a progressive series of ships vessels capes and promontories that i could not help thinking i had a distant view of thirty leagues upon the background of the picture if there is any taste for ingenuity left in a degenerate age fast sinking into barbarism this artist i apprehend will make a capital figure as soon as his works are known  two days ago i was favoured with a visit by mr fitzowen who with great formality solicited my vote and interest at the general election i ought not to have been shocked at the confidence of this man though it was remarkable considering what had passed between him and me on a former occasionthese visits are mere matter of form which a candidate makes to every elector even to those who he knows are engaged in the interest of his competitor lest he should expose himself to the imputation of pride at a time when it is expected he should appear humble indeed i know nothing so abject as the behaviour of a man canvassing for a seat in parliamentthis mean prostration to boroughelectors especially has i imagine contributed in a great measure to raise that spirit of insolence among the vulgar which like the devil will be found very difficult to lay be that as it may i was in some confusion at the effrontery of fitzowen but i soon recollected myself and told him i had not yet determined for whom i should give my vote nor whether i should give it for anythe truth is i look upon both candidates in the same light and should think myself a traitor to the constitution of my country if i voted for either if every elector would bring the same consideration home to his conscience we should not have such reason to exclaim against the venality of pts but we all are a pack of venal and corrupted rascals so lost to all sense of honesty and all tenderness of character that in a little time i am fully persuaded nothing will be infamous but virtue and publicspirit  g h who is really an enthusiast in patriotism and represented the capital in several successive parliaments declared to me tother day with the tears in his eyes that he had lived above thirty years in the city of london and dealt in the way of commerce with all the citizens of note in their turns but that as he should answer to god he had never in the whole course of his life found above three or four whom he could call thoroughly honest a declaration which was rather mortifying than surprising to me who have found so few men of worth in the course of my acquaintance that they serve only as exceptions which in the grammarians phrase confirm and prove a general canoni know you will say g h saw imperfectly through the mist of prejudice and i am rankled by the spleenperhaps you are partly in the right for i have perceived that my opinion of mankind like mercury in the thermometer rises and falls according to the variations of the weather  pray settle accompts with barnes take what money of mine is in his hands and give him acquittance if you think davis has stock or credit enough to do justice to the farm give him a discharge for the rent that is due this will animate his industry for i know that nothing is so discouraging to a farmer as the thoughts of being in arrears with his landlord he becomes dispirited and neglects his labour and so the farm goes to wreck tabby has been clamouring for some days about the lambs skin which williams the hind begged of me when he was last at bath prithee take it back paying the fellow the full value of it that i may have some peace in my own house and let him keep his own counsel if he means to keep his placeo i shall never presume to despise or censure any poor man for suffering himself to be henpecked conscious how i myself am obliged to truckle to a domestic demon even though blessed be god she is not yoked with me for life in the matrimonial waggonshe has quarrelled with the servants of the house about vails and such intolerable scolding ensued on both sides that i have been fain to appease the cook and chambermaid by stealth cant you find some poor gentleman of wales to take this precious commodity off the hands of  yours matt bramble bath may        to dr lewis  docter lews  give me leaf to tell you methinks you mought employ your talons better than to encourage servants to pillage their masters i find by gwyllim that villiams has got my skin for which he is an impotent rascal he has not only got my skin but moreover my buttermilk to fatten his pigs and i suppose the next thing he gets will be my pad to carry his daughter to church and fair roger gets this and roger gets that but id have you to know i wont be rogered at this rate by any ragmatical fellow in the kingdomand i am surprised docter lews you would offer to put my affairs in composition with the refuge and skim of the hearth i have toiled and moyled to a good purpuss for the advantage of matts family if i cant safe as much owl as will make me an under petticoat as for the buttermilk neer a pig in the parish shall thrust his snout in it with my goodwill theres a famous physician at the hot well that prescribes it to his patience when the case is consumptive and the scots and irish have begun to drink it already in such quantities that there is not a drop left for the hogs in the whole neighbourhood of bristol ill have our buttermilk barrelled up and sent twice aweek to aberginny where it may be sold for a halfpenny the quart and so roger may carry his pigs to another marketi hope docter you will not go to put any more such phims in my brothers head to the prejudice of my pockat but rather give me some raisins which hitherto you have not done to subscribe myself  your humble servant tab bramble bath may        to sir watkin phillips of jesus college oxon  dear phillips  without waiting for your answer to my last i proceed to give you an account of our journey to london which has not been wholly barren of adventure tuesday last the squire took his place in a hired coach and four accompanied by his sister and mine and mrs tabbys maid winifrid jenkins whose province it was to support chowder on a cushion in her lap i could scarce refrain from laughing when i looked into the vehicle and saw that animal sitting opposite to my uncle like any other passenger the squire ashamed of his situation blushed to the eyes and calling to the postilions to drive on pulled the glass up in my face i and his servant john thomas attended them on horseback  nothing worth mentioning occurred till we arrived on the edge of marlborough downs there one of the four horses fell in going down hill at a round trot and the postilion behind endeavouring to stop the carriage pulled it on one side into a deep rut where it was fairly overturned i had rode on about two hundred yards before but hearing a loud scream galloped back and dismounted to give what assistance was in my power when i looked into the coach i could see nothing distinctly but the nether end of jenkins who was kicking her heels and squalling with great vociferation all of a sudden my uncle thrust up his bare pate and bolted through the window as nimble as a grasshopper having made use of poor wins posteriors as a step to rise in his ascentthe man who had likewise quitted his horse dragged this forlorn damsel more dead than alive through the same opening then mr bramble pulling the door off its hinges with a jerk laid hold on liddys arm and brought her to the light very much frighted but little hurt it fell to my share to deliver our aunt tabitha who had lost her cap in the struggle and being rather more than half frantic with rage and terror was no bad representation of one of the sister furies that guard the gates of hellshe expressed no sort of concern for her brother who ran about in the cold without his periwig and worked with the most astonishing agility in helping to disentangle the horses from the carriage but she cried in a tone of distraction chowder chowder my dear chowder my poor chowder is certainly killed  this was not the casechowder after having tore my uncles leg in the confusion of the fall had retreated under the scat and from thence the footman drew him by the neck for which good office he bit his fingers to the bone the fellow who is naturally surly was so provoked at this assault that he saluted his ribs with a hearty kick exclaiming damn the nasty son of a bitch and them he belongs to a benediction which was by no means lost upon the implacable virago his mistressher brother however prevailed upon her to retire into a peasants house near the scene of action where his head and hers were covered and poor jenkins had a fit our next care was to apply some sticking plaister to the wound in his leg which exhibited the impression of chowders teeth but he never opened his lips against the delinquentmrs tabby alarmed at this scene you say nothing matt cried she but i know your mindi know the spite you have to that poor unfortunate animal i know you intend to take his life away you are mistaken upon my honour replied the squire with a sarcastic smile i should be incapable of harbouring any such cruel design against an object so amiable and inoffensive even if he had not the happiness to be your favourite  john thomas was not so delicate the fellow whether really alarmed for his life or instigated by the desire of revenge came in and bluntly demanded that the dog should be put to death on the supposition that if ever he should run mad hereafter he who had been bit by him would be infectedmy uncle calmly argued upon the absurdity of his opinion observing that he himself was in the same predicament and would certainly take the precaution he proposed if he was not sure he ran no risque of infection nevertheless thomas continued obstinate and at length declared that if the dog was not shot immediately he himself would be his executionerthis declaration opened the floodgates of tabbys eloquence which would have shamed the firstrate oratress of billingsgate the footman retorted in the same stile and the squire dismissed him from his service after having prevented me from giving him a good horsewhipping for his insolence  the coach being adjusted another difficulty occurredmrs tabitha absolutely refused to enter it again unless another driver could be found to take the place of the postilion who she affirmed had overturned the carriage from malice aforethoughtafter much dispute the man resigned his place to a shabby country fellow who undertook to go as far as marlborough where they could be better provided and at that place we arrived about one oclock without farther impediment mrs bramble however found new matter of offence which indeed she has a particular genius for extracting at will from almost every incident in life we had scarce entered the room at marlborough where we stayed to dine when she exhibited a formal complaint against the poor fellow who had superseded the postilion she said he was such a beggarly rascal that he had neer a shirt to his back and had the impudence to shock her sight by shewing his bare posteriors for which act of indelicacy he deserved to be set in the stocks mrs winifred jenkins confirmed the assertion with respect to his nakedness observing at the same time that he had a skin as fair as alabaster  this is a heinous offence indeed cried my uncle let us hear what the fellow has to say in his own vindication he was accordingly summoned and made his appearance which was equally queer and pathetic he seemed to be about twenty years of age of a middling size with bandy legs stooping shoulders high forehead sandy locks pinking eyes flat nose and long chinbut his complexion was of a sickly yellow his looks denoted famine and the rags that he wore could hardly conceal what decency requires to be coveredmy uncle having surveyed him attentively said with an ironical expression in his countenance ant you ashamed fellow to ride postilion without a shirt to cover your backside from the view of the ladies in the coach yes i am an please your noble honour answered the man but necessity has no law as the saying isand more than that it was an accident my breeches cracked behind after i had got into the saddle youre an impudent varlet cried mrs tabby for presuming to ride before persons of fashion without a shirti am so an please your worthy ladyship said he but i am a poor wiltshire ladi hant a shirt in the world that i can call my own nor a rag of clothes and please your ladyship but what you seei have no friend nor relation upon earth to help me outi have had the fever and ague these six months and spent all i had in the world upon doctors and to keep soul and body together and saving your ladyships good presence i hant broke bread these four and twenty hours  mrs bramble turning from him said she had never seen such a filthy tatterdemalion and bid him begone observing that he would fill the room full of verminher brother darted a significant glance at her as she retired with liddy into another apartment and then asked the man if he was known to any person in marlboroughwhen he answered that the landlord of the inn had known him from his infancy mine host was immediately called and being interrogated on the subject declared that the young fellows name was humphry clinker that he had been a love begotten babe brought up in the workhouse and put out apprentice by the parish to a country blacksmith who died before the boys time was out that he had for some time worked under his ostler as a helper and extra postilion till he was taken ill of the ague which disabled him from getting his bread that having sold or pawned every thing he had in the world for his cure and subsistence he became so miserable and shabby that he disgraced the stable and was dismissed but that he never heard any thing to the prejudice of his character in other respects so that the fellow being sick and destitute said my uncle you turned him out to die in the streets i pay the poors rate replied the other and i have no right to maintain idle vagrants either in sickness or health besides such a miserable object would have brought a discredit upon my house  you perceive said the squire turning to me our landlord is a christian of bowelswho shall presume to censure the morals of the age when the very publicans exhibit such examples of humanityheark ye clinker you are a most notorious offenderyou stand convicted of sickness hunger wretchedness and wantbut as it does not belong to me to punish criminals i will only take upon me the task of giving you a word of advice get a shirt with all convenient dispatch that your nakedness may not henceforward give offence to travelling gentlewomen especially maidens in years  so saying he put a guinea into the hand of the poor fellow who stood staring at him in silence with his mouth wide open till the landlord pushed him out of the room  in the afternoon as our aunt stept into the coach she observed with some marks of satisfaction that the postilion who rode next to her was not a shabby wretch like the ragamuffin who had them into marlborough indeed the difference was very conspicuous this was a smart fellow with a narrow brimmed hat with gold cording a cut bob a decent blue jacket leatherbreaches and a clean linen shirt puffed above the waistband when we arrived at the castle on spinhill where we lay this new postilion was remarkably assiduous in bringing in the loose parcels and at length displayed the individual countenance of humphry clinker who had metamorphosed himself in this manner by relieving from pawn part of his own clothes with the money he had received from mr bramble  howsoever pleased the rest of the company were with such a favourable change in the appearance of this poor creature it soured on the stomach of mrs tabby who had not yet digested the affront of his naked skinshe tossed her nose in disdain saying she supposed her brother had taken him into favour because he had insulted her with his obscenity that a fool and his money were soon parted but that if matt intended to take the fellow with him to london she would not go a foot further that waymy uncle said nothing with his tongue though his looks were sufficiently expressive and next morning clinker did not appear so that we proceeded without further altercation to salthill where we proposed to dinethere the first person that came to the side of the coach and began to adjust the footboard was no other than humphry clinkerwhen i handed out mrs bramble she eyed him with a furious look and passed into the housemy uncle was embarrassed and asked him peevishly what had brought him hither the fellow said his honour had been so good to him that he had not the heart to part with him that he would follow him to the worlds end and serve him all the days of his life without fee or reward  mr bramble did not know whether to chide or laugh at this declarationhe foresaw much contradiction on the side of tabby and on the other hand he could not but be pleased with the gratitude of clinker as well as with the simplicity of his charactersuppose i was inclined to take you into my service said he what are your qualifications what are you good for an please your honour answered this original i can read and write and do the business of the stable indifferent welli can dress a horse and shoe him and bleed and rowel him and as for the practice of sowgelding i wont turn my back on eer a he in the county of wiltsthen i can make hogs puddings and hobnails mend kettles and tin saucepanshere uncle burst out alaughing and inquired what other accomplishments he was master ofi know something of singlestick and psalmody proceeded clinker i can play upon the jewsharp sing blackeyd susan arthurobradley and divers other songs i can dance a welsh jig and nancy dawson wrestle a fall with any lad of my inches when im in heart and under correction i can find a hare when your honour wants a bit of game foregad thou are a complete fellow cried my uncle still laughing i have a good mind to take thee into my familyprithee go and try if thou canst make peace with my sisterthou hast given her much offence by shewing her thy naked tail  clinker accordingly followed us into the room cap in hand where addressing himself to mrs tabitha may it please your ladyships worship cried he to pardon and forgive my offences and with gods assistance i shall take care that my tail shall never rise up in judgment against me to offend your ladyship again do pray good sweet beautiful lady take compassion on a poor sinnergod bless your noble countenance i am sure you are too handsome and generous to bear malicei will serve you on my bended knees by night and by day by land and by water and all for the love and pleasure of serving such an excellent lady  this compliment and humiliation had some effect upon tabby but she made no reply and clinker taking silence for consent gave his attendance at dinner the fellows natural aukwardness and the flutter of his spirits were productive of repeated blunders in the course of his attendanceat length he spilt part of a custard upon her right shoulder and starting back trod upon chowder who set up a dismal howlpoor humphry was so disconcerted at this double mistake that he dropt the china dish which broke into a thousand pieces then falling down upon his knees remained in that posture gaping with a most ludicrous aspect of distress mrs bramble flew to the dog and snatching him in her arms presented him to her brother saying this is all a concerted scheme against this unfortunate animal whose only crime is its regard for mehere it is kill it at once and then youll be satisfied  clinker hearing these words and taking them in the literal acceptation got up in some hurry and seizing a knife from the sideboard cried not here an please your ladyshipit will daub the roomgive him to me and ill carry him to the ditch by the roadside to this proposal he received no other answer than a hearty box on the ear that made him stagger to the other side of the room what said she to her brother am i to be affronted by every mangy hound that you pick up on the highway i insist upon your sending this rascallion about his business immediately for gods sake sister compose yourself said my uncle and consider that the poor fellow is innocent of any intention to give you offence innocent as the babe unborn cried humphry i see it plainly exclaimed this implacable maiden he acts by your direction and you are resolved to support him in his impudence this is a bad return for all the services i have done you for nursing you in your sickness managing your family and keeping you from ruining yourself by your own imprudencebut now you shall part with that rascal or me upon the spot without farther loss of time and the world shall see whether you have more regard for your own flesh and blood or for a beggarly foundling taken from the dunghill  mr brambles eyes began to glisten and his teeth to chatter if stated fairly said he raising his voice the question is whether i have spirit to shake off an intolerable yoke by one effort of resolution or meanness enough to do an act of cruelty and injustice to gratify the rancour of a capricious womanheark ye mrs tabitha bramble i will now propose an alternative in my turn either discard your fourfooted favourite or give me leave to bid you eternally adieufor i am determined that he and i shall live no longer under the same roof and to dinner with what appetite you maythunderstruck at this declaration she sat down in a corner and after a pause of some minutes sure i dont understand you matt said she and yet i spoke in plain english answered the squire with a peremptory look sir resumed this virago effectually humbled it is your prerogative to command and my duty to obey i cant dispose of the dog in this place but if youll allow him to go in the coach to london i give you my word he shall never trouble you again  her brother entirely disarmed by this mild reply declared she could ask him nothing in reason that he would refuse adding i hope sister you have never found me deficient in natural affection  mrs tabitha immediately rose and throwing her arms about his neck kissed him on the cheek he returned her embrace with great emotion liddy sobbed win jenkins cackled chowder capered and clinker skipped about rubbing his hands for joy of this reconciliation  concord being thus restored we finished our meal with comfort and in the evening arrived at london without having met with any other adventure my aunt seems to be much mended by the hint she received from her brother she has been graciously pleased to remove her displeasure from clinker who is now retained as a footman and in a day or two will make his appearance in a new suit of livery but as he is little acquainted with london we have taken an occasional valet whom i intend hereafter to hire as my own servant we lodge in goldensquare at the house of one mrs notion a decent sort of a woman who takes great pains to make us all easy my uncle proposes to make a circuit of all the remarkable scenes of this metropolis for the entertainment of his pupils but as both you and i are already acquainted with most of those he will visit and with some others he little dreams of i shall only communicate what will be in some measure new to your observation remember me to our jesuitical friends and believe me ever  dear knight yours affectionately j melford london may        to dr lewis  dear doctor  london is literally new to me new in its streets houses and even in its situation as the irishman said london is now gone out of town what i left open fields producing hay and corn i now find covered with streets and squares and palaces and churches i am credibly informed that in the space of seven years eleven thousand new houses have been built in one quarter of westminster exclusive of what is daily added to other parts of this unwieldy metropolis pimlico and knightsbridge are now almost joined to chelsea and kensington and if this infatuation continues for half a century i suppose the whole county of middlesex will be covered with brick  it must be allowed indeed for the credit of the present age that london and westminster are much better paved and lighted than they were formerly the new streets are spacious regular and airy and the houses generally convenient the bridge at blackfriars is a noble monument of taste and publicspiriti wonder how they stumbled upon a work of such magnificence and utility but notwithstanding these improvements the capital is become an overgrown monster which like a dropsical head will in time leave the body and extremities without nourishment and support the absurdity will appear in its full force when we consider that one sixth part of the natives of this whole extensive kingdom is crowded within the bills of mortality what wonder that our villages are depopulated and our farms in want of daylabourers the abolition of small farms is but one cause of the decrease of population indeed the incredible increase of horses and black cattle to answer the purposes of luxury requires a prodigious quantity of hay and grass which are raised and managed without much labour but a number of hands will always be wanted for the different branches of agriculture whether the farms be large or small the tide of luxury has swept all the inhabitants from the open countrythe poorest squire as well as the richest peer must have his house in town and make a figure with an extraordinary number of domestics the ploughboys cowherds and lower hinds are debauched and seduced by the appearance and discourse of those coxcombs in livery when they make their summer excursions they desert their dirt and drudgery and swarm up to london in hopes of getting into service where they can live luxuriously and wear fine clothes without being obliged to work for idleness is natural to mangreat numbers of these being disappointed in their expectation become thieves and sharpers and london being an immense wilderness in which there is neither watch nor ward of any signification nor any order or police affords them lurkingplaces as well as prey  there are many causes that contribute to the daily increase of this enormous mass but they may be all resolved into the grand source of luxury and corruptionabout five and twenty years ago very few even of the most opulent citizens of london kept any equipage or even any servants in livery their tables produced nothing but plain boiled and roasted with a bottle of port and a tankard of beer at present every trader in any degree of credit every broker and attorney maintains a couple of footmen a coachman and postilion he has his townhouse and his countryhouse his coach and his postchaise his wife and daughters appear in the richest stuffs bespangled with diamonds they frequent the court the opera the theatre and the masquerade they hold assemblies at their own houses they make sumptuous entertainments and treat with the richest wines of bordeaux burgundy and champagne the substantial tradesman who wont to pass his evenings at the alehouse for fourpence halfpenny now spends three shillings at the tavern while his wife keeps cardtables at home she must likewise have fine clothes her chaise or pad with country lodgings and go three times a week to public diversions every clerk apprentice and even waiter of tavern or coffeehouse maintains a gelding by himself or in partnership and assumes the air and apparel of a petit maitrethe gayest places of public entertainment are filled with fashionable figures which upon inquiry will be found to be journeymen taylors servingmen and abigails disguised like their betters  in short there is no distinction or subordination leftthe different departments of life are jumbled togetherthe hodcarrier the low mechanic the tapster the publican the shopkeeper the pettifogger the citizen and courtier all tread upon the kibes of one another actuated by the demons of profligacy and licentiousness they are seen every where rambling riding rolling rushing justling mixing bouncing cracking and crashing in one vile ferment of stupidity and corruptionall is tumult and hurry one would imagine they were impelled by some disorder of the brain that will not suffer them to be at rest the footpassengers run along as if they were pursued by bailiffs the porters and chairmen trot with their burthens people who keep their own equipages drive through the streets at full speed even citizens physicians and apothecaries glide in their chariots like lightening the hackneycoachmen make their horses smoke and the pavement shakes under them and i have actually seen a waggon pass through piccadilly at the handgallop in a word the whole nation seems to be running out of their wits  the diversions of the times are not ill suited to the genius of this incongruous monster called the public give it noise confusion glare and glitter it has no idea of elegance and proprietywhat are the amusements of ranelagh one half of the company are following at the others tails in an eternal circle like so many blind asses in an olivemill where they can neither discourse distinguish nor be distinguished while the other half are drinking hot water under the denomination of tea till nine or ten oclock at night to keep them awake for the rest of the evening as for the orchestra the vocal music especially it is well for the performers that they cannot be heard distinctly vauxhall is a composition of baubles overcharged with paltry ornaments ill conceived and poorly executed without any unity of design or propriety of disposition it is an unnatural assembly of objects fantastically illuminated in broken masses seemingly contrived to dazzle the eyes and divert the imagination of the vulgarhere a wooden lion there a stone statue in one place a range of things like coffeehouse boxes covered atop in another a parcel of alehouse benches in a third a puppetshow representation of a tin cascade in a fourth a gloomy cave of a circular form like a sepulchral vault half lighted in a fifth a scanty flip of grassplat that would not afford pasture sufficient for an asss colt the walks which nature seems to have intended for solitude shade and silence are filled with crowds of noisy people sucking up the nocturnal rheums of an aguish climate and through these gay scenes a few lamps glimmer like so many farthing candles  when i see a number of well dressed people of both sexes sitting on the covered benches exposed to the eyes of the mob and which is worse to the cold raw nightair devouring sliced beef and swilling port and punch and cyder i cant help compassionating their temerity white i despise their want of taste and decorum but when they course along those damp and gloomy walks or crowd together upon the wet gravel without any other cover than the cope of heaven listening to a song which one half of them cannot possibly hear how can i help supposing they are actually possessed by a spirit more absurd and pernicious than any thing we meet with in the precincts of bedlam in all probability the proprietors of this and other public gardens of inferior note in the skirts of the metropolis are in some shape connected with the faculty of physic and the company of undertakers for considering that eagerness in the pursuit of what is called pleasure which now predominates through every rank and denomination of life i am persuaded that more gouts rheumatisms catarrhs and consumptions are caught in these nocturnal pastimes sub dio than from all the risques and accidents to which a life of toil and danger is exposed  these and other observations which i have made in this excursion will shorten my stay at london and send me back with a double relish to my solitude and mountains but i shall return by a different route from that which brought me to town i have seen some old friends who constantly resided in this virtuous metropolis but they are so changed in manners and disposition that we hardly know or care for one anotherin our journey from bath my sister tabby provoked me into a transport of passion during which like a man who has drank himself potvaliant i talked to her in such a stile of authority and resolution as produced a most blessed effect she and her dog have been remarkably quiet and orderly ever since this expostulation how long this agreeable calm will last heaven above knowsi flatter myself the exercise of travelling has been of service to my health a circumstance which encourages me toproceed in my projected expedition to the north but i must in the mean time for the benefit and amusement of my pupils explore the depths of this chaos this misshapen and monstrous capital without head or tail members or proportion  thomas was so insolent to my sister on the road that i was obliged to turn him off abruptly betwixt chippenham and marlborough where our coach was overturned the fellow was always sullen and selfish but if he should return to the country you may give him a character for honesty and sobriety and provided he behaves with proper respect to the family let him have a couple of guineas in the name of  yours always matt bramble london may  0     to miss laetitia willis at gloucester  my dear letty  inexpressible was the pleasure i received from yours of the   th which was last night put into my hands by mrs brentford the milliner from gloucesteri rejoice to hear that my worthy governess is in good health and still more that she no longer retains any displeasure towards her poor liddy i am sorry you have lost the society of the agreeable miss vaughn but i hope you wont have cause much longer to regret the departure of your school companions as i make no doubt but your parents will in a little time bring you into the world where you are so well qualified to make a distinguished figure when that is the case i flatter myself you and i shall meet again and be happy together and even improve the friendship which we contracted in our tender years this at least i can promiseit shall not be for the want of my utmost endeavours if our intimacy does not continue for life  about five days ago we arrived in london after an easy journey from bath during which however we were overturned and met with some other little incidents which had like to have occasioned a misunderstanding betwixt my uncle and aunt but now thank god they are happily reconciled we live in harmony together and every day make parties to see the wonders of this vast metropolis which however i cannot pretend to describe for i have not as yet seen one hundredth part of its curiosities and i am quite in a maze of admiration  the cities of london and westminster are spread out into an incredible extent the streets squares rows lanes and alleys are innumerable palaces public buildings and churches rise in every quarter and among these last st pauls appears with the most astonishing preeminence they say it is not so large as st peters at rome but for my own part i can have no idea of any earthly temple more grand and magnificent  but even these superb objects are not so striking as the crowds of people that swarm in the streets i at first imagined that some great assembly was just dismissed and wanted to stand aside till the multitude should pass but this human tide continues to flow without interruption or abatement from morn till night then there is such an infinity of gay equipages coaches chariots chaises and other carriages continually rolling and shifting before your eyes that ones head grows giddy looking at them and the imagination is quite confounded with splendour and variety nor is the prospect by water less grand and astonishing than that by land you see three stupendous bridges joining the opposite banks of a broad deep and rapid river so vast so stately so elegant that they seem to be the work of the giants betwixt them the whole surface of the thames is covered with small vessels barges boats and wherries passing to and fro and below the three bridges such a prodigious forest of masts for miles together that you would think all the ships in the universe were here assembled all that you read of wealth and grandeur in the arabian nights entertainment and the persian tales concerning bagdad diarbekir damascus ispahan and samarkand is here realized  ranelagh looks like the inchanted palace of a genie adorned with the most exquisite performances of painting carving and gilding enlightened with a thousand golden lamps that emulate the noonday sun crowded with the great the rich the gay the happy and the fair glittering with cloth of gold and silver lace embroidery and precious stones while these exulting sons and daughters of felicity tread this round of pleasure or regale in different parties and separate lodges with fine imperial tea and other delicious refreshments their ears are entertained with the most ravishing delights of music both instrumental and vocal there i heard the famous tenducci a thing from italyit looks for all the world like a man though they say it is not the voice to be sure is neither mans nor womans but it is more melodious than either and it warbled so divinely that while i listened i really thought myself in paradise  at nine oclock in a charming moonlight evening we embarked at ranelagh for vauxhall in a wherry so light and slender that we looked like so many fairies sailing in a nutshell my uncle being apprehensive of catching cold upon the water went round in the coach and my aunt would have accompanied him but he would not suffer me to go by water if she went by land and therefore she favoured us with her company as she perceived i had a curiosity to make this agreeable voyageafter all the vessel was sufficiently loaded for besides the waterman there was my brother jery and a friend of his one mr barton a country gentleman of a good fortune who had dined at our housethe pleasure of this little excursion was however damped by my being sadly frighted at our landing where there was a terrible confusion of wherries and a crowd of people bawling and swearing and quarrelling nay a parcel of uglylooking fellows came running into the water and laid hold of our boat with great violence to pull it ashore nor would they quit their hold till my brother struck one of them over the head with his cane but this flutter was fully recompensed by the pleasures of vauxhall which i no sooner entered than i was dazzled and confounded with the variety of beauties that rushed all at once upon my eye image to yourself my dear letty a spacious garden part laid out in delightful walks bounded with high hedges and trees and paved with gravel part exhibiting a wonderful assemblage of the most picturesque and striking objects pavilions lodges groves grottoes lawns temples and cascades porticoes colonades and rotundos adorned with pillars statues and painting the whole illuminated with an infinite number of lamps disposed in different figures of suns stars and constellations the place crowded with the gayest company ranging through those blissful shades or supping in different lodges on cold collations enlivened with mirth freedom and good humour and animated by an excellent band of music among the vocal performers i had the happiness to hear the celebrated mrs whose voice was loud and shrill that it made my head ake through excess of pleasure  in about half an hour after we arrived we were joined by my uncle who did not seem to relish the place people of experience and infirmity my dear letty see with very different eyes from those that such as you and i make use ofour evenings entertainment was interrupted by an unlucky accident in one of the remotest walks we were surprised with a sudden shower that set the whole company arunning and drove us in heaps one upon another into the rotunda where my uncle finding himself wet began to be very peevish and urgent to be gone my brother went to look for the coach and found it with much difficulty but as it could not hold us all mr barton stayed behind it was some time before the carriage could be brought up to the gate in the confusion notwithstanding the utmost endeavours of our new footman humphry clinker who lost his scratch periwig and got a broken head in the scuffle the moment we were seated my aunt pulled off my uncles shoes and carefully wrapped his poor feet in her capuchin then she gave him a mouthful of cordial which she always keeps in her pocket and his clothes were shifted as soon as we arrived at lodgings so that blessed be god he escaped a severe cold of which he was in great terror  as for mr barton i must tell you in confidence he was a little particular but perhaps i mistake his complaisance and i wish i may for his sakeyou know the condition of my poor heart which in spite of hard usageand yet i ought not to complain nor will i till farther information  besides ranelagh and vauxhall i have been at mrs cornelys assembly which for the rooms the company the dresses and decorations surpasses all description but as i have no great turn for card playing i have not yet entered thoroughly into the spirit of the place indeed i am still such a country hoyden that i could hardly find patience to be put in a condition to appear yet as i was not above six hours under the hands of the hairdresser who stuffed my head with as much black wool as would have made a quilted petticoat and after all it was the smallest head in the assembly except my auntsshe to be sure was so particular with her rumpt gown and petticoat her scanty curls her lappethead deep triple ruffles and high stays that every body looked at her with surprise some whispered and some tittered and lady griskin by whom we were introduced flatly told her she was twenty good years behind the fashion  lady griskin is a person of fashion to whom we have the honour to be related she keeps a small rout at her own house never exceeding ten or a dozen cardtables but these are frequented by the best company in townshe has been so obliging as to introduce my aunt and me to some of her particular friends of quality who treat us with the most familiar goodhumour we have once dined with her and she takes the trouble to direct us in all our motions i am so happy as to have gained her goodwill to such a degree that she sometimes adjusts my cap with her own hands and she has given me a kind invitation to stay with her all the winter this however has been cruelly declined by my uncle who seems to be i know not how prejudiced against the good lady for whenever my aunt happens to speak in her commendation i observe that he makes wry faces though he says nothingperhaps indeed these grimaces may be the effect of pain arising from the gout and rheumatism with which he is sadly distressedto me however he is always goodnatured and generous even beyond my wish since we came hither he has made me a present of a suit of clothes with trimmings and laces which cost more money than i shall mention and jery at his desire has given me my mothers diamond crops which are ordered to be set anew so that it wont be his fault if i do not glitter among the stars of the fourth or fifth magnitude i wish my weak head may not grow giddy in the midst of all this gallantry and dissipation though as yet i can safely declare i could gladly give up all these tumultuous pleasures for country solitude and a happy retreat with those we love among whom my dear willis will always possess the first place in the breast of her  ever affectionate lydia melford london may        to sir watkin phillips of jesus college oxon  dear phillips  i send you this letter franked by our old friend barton who is as much altered as it was possible for a man of his kidney to be instead of the careless indolent sloven we knew at oxford i found him a busy talkative politician a petitmaitre in his dress and a ceremonious courtier in his manners he has not gall enough in his constitution to be enflamed with the rancour of party so as to deal in scurrilous invectives but since he obtained a place he is become a warm partizan of the ministry and sees every thing through such an exaggerating medium as to me who am happily of no party is altogether incomprehensiblewithout all doubt the fumes of faction not only disturb the faculty of reason but also pervert the organs of sense and i would lay a hundred guineas to ten that if barton on one side and the most conscientious patriot in the opposition on the other were to draw upon honour the picture of the king or ministers you and i who are still uninfected and unbiased would find both painters equally distant from the truth one thing however must be allowed for the honour of barton he never breaks out into illiberal abuse far less endeavours by infamous calumnies to blast the moral character of any individual on the other side  ever since we came hither he has been remarkably assiduous in his attention to our family an attention which in a man of his indolence and avocations i should have thought altogether odd and even unnatural had not i perceived that my sister liddy had made some impression upon his heart i cannot say that i have any objection to his trying his fortune in this pursuit if an opulent estate and a great flock of goodnature are sufficient qualifications in a husband to render the marriagestate happy for life she may be happy with barton but i imagine there is something else required to engage and secure the affection of a woman of sense and delicacy something which nature has denied our friendliddy seems to be of the same opinion when he addresses himself to her in discourse she seems to listen with reluctance and industriously avoids all particular communication but in proportion to her coyness our aunt is coming mrs tabitha goes more than half way to meet his advances she mistakes or affects to mistake the meaning of his courtesy which is rather formal and fulsome she returns his compliments with hyperbolical interest she persecutes him with her civilities at table she appeals to him for ever in conversation she sighs and flirts and ogles and by her hideous affectation and impertinence drives the poor courtier to the very extremity of his complaisance in short she seems to have undertaken the siege of bartons heart and carries on her approaches in such a desperate manner that i dont know whether he will not be obliged to capitulate in the mean time his aversion to this inamorata struggling with his acquired affability and his natural fear of giving offence throws him into a kind of distress which is extremely ridiculous  two days ago he persuaded my uncle and me to accompany him to st jamess where he undertook to make us acquainted with the persons of all the great men in the kingdom and indeed there was a great assemblage of distinguished characters for it was a high festival at court our conductor performed his promise with great punctuality he pointed out almost every individual of both sexes and generally introduced them to our notice with a flourish of panegyrickseeing the king approach there comes said he the most amiable sovereign that ever swayed the sceptre of england the delicioe humani generis augustus in patronizing merit titus vespasian in generosity trajan in beneficence and marcus aurelius in philosophy a very honest kind hearted gentleman added my uncle hes too good for the times a king of england should have a spice of the devil in his composition barton then turning to the duke of cumberland proceededyou know the duke that illustrious hero who trode rebellion under his feet and secured us in possession of every thing we ought to hold dear as english men and christians mark what an eye how penetrating yet pacific what dignity in his mien what humanity in his aspecteven malice must own that he is one of the greatest officers in christendom i think he is said mr bramble but who are these young gentlemen that stand beside him those cried our friend those are his royal nephews the princes of the blood sweet young princes the sacred pledges of the protestant line so spirited so sensible so princelyyes very sensible very spirited said my uncle interrupting him but see the queen ha theres the queentheres the queen let me seelet me seewhere are my glasses ha theres meaning in that eyetheres sentimenttheres expressionwell mr barton what figure do you call next the next person he pointed out was the favourite yearl who stood solitary by one of the windowsbehold yon northern star said he shorn of his beamswhat the caledonian luminary that lately blazed so bright in our hemisphere methinks at present it glimmers through a fog like saturn without his ring bleak and dim and distantha theres the other great phenomenon the grand pensionary that weathercock of patriotism that veers about in every point of the political compass and still feels the wind of popularity in his tail he too like a portentous comet has risen again above the courthorizon but how long he will continue to ascend it is not easy to foretell considering his great eccentricitywho are those two satellites that attend his motions when barton told him their names to their characters said mr bramble i am no stranger one of them without a drop of red blood in his veins has a cold intoxicating vapour in his head and rancour enough in his heart to inoculate and affect a whole nation the other is i hear intended for a share in the administration and the pensionary vouches for his being duly qualifiedthe only instance i ever heard of his sagacity was his deserting his former patron when he found him declining in power and in disgrace with the people without principle talent or intelligence he is ungracious as a hog greedy as a vulture and thievish as a jackdaw but it must be owned he is no hypocrite he pretends to no virtue and takes no pains to disguise his characterhis ministry will be attended with one advantage no man will be disappointed by his breach of promise as no mortal ever trusted to his word i wonder how lordfirst discovered this happy genius and for what purpose lordhas now adopted him but one would think that as amber has a power to attract dirt and straws and chaff a minister is endued with the same kind of faculty to lick up every knave and blockhead in his wayhis eulogium was interrupted by the arrival of the old duke of n who squeezing into the circle with a busy face of importance thrust his head into every countenance as if he had been in search of somebody to whom he wanted to impart something of great consequencemy uncle who had been formerly known to him bowed as he passed and the duke seeing himself saluted so respectfully by a welldressed person was not slow in returning the courtesyhe even came up and taking him cordially by the hand my dear friend mr a said he i am rejoiced to see you how long have you been come from abroadhow did you leave our good friends the dutch the king of prussia dont think of another war ahhes a great king a great conqueror a very great conqueror your alexanders and hannibals were nothing at all to him sircorporals drummers dross mere trashdamned trash hehhis grace being by this time out of breath my uncle took the opportunity to tell him he had not been out of england that his name was bramble and that he had the honour to sit in the last parliament but one of the late king as representative for the borough of dymkymraig odso cried the duke i remember you perfectly well my dear mr brambleyou was always a good and loyal subjecta stanch friend to administrationi made your brother an irish bishoppardon me my lord said the squire i once had a brother but he was a captain in the armyha said his grace he was sohe was indeed but who was the bishop then bishop blackberrysure it was bishop blackberry perhaps some relation of yoursvery likely my lord replied my uncle the blackberry is the fruit of the bramblebut i believe the bishop is not a berry of our bushno more he isno more he is ha ha ha exclaimed the duke there you gave me a scratch good mr bramble ha ha hawell i shall be glad to see you at lincolns innfieldsyou know the waytimes are altered though i have lost the power i retain the inclinationyour very humble servant good mr blackberryso saying he shoved to another corner of the room what a fine old gentleman cried mr barton what spirits what a memory he never forgets an old friend he does me too much honour observed our squire to rank me among the numberwhilst i sat in parliament i never voted with the ministry but three times when my conscience told me they were in the right however if he still keeps levee i will carry my nephew thither that he may see and learn to avoid the scene for i think an english gentleman never appears to such disadvantage as at the levee of a ministerof his grace i shall say nothing at present but that for thirty years he was the constant and common butt of ridicule and execration he was generally laughed at as an ape in politics whose office and influence served only to render his folly the more notorious and the opposition cursed him as the indefatigable drudge of a firstmover who was justly stiled and stigmatized as the father of corruption but this ridiculous ape this venal drudge no sooner lost the places he was so ill qualified to fill and unfurled the banners of faction than he was metamorphosed into a pattern of public virtue the very people who reviled him before now extolled him to the skies as a wise experienced statesman chief pillar of the protestant succession and corner stone of english liberty i should be glad to know how mr barton reconciles these contradictions without obliging us to resign all title to the privilege of common sense my dear sir answered barton i dont pretend to justify the extravagations of the multitude who i suppose were as wild in their former censure as in the present praise but i shall be very glad to attend you on thursday next to his graces levee where im afraid we shall not be crowded with company for you know theres a wide difference between his present office of president of the council and his former post of first lord commissioner of the treasury  this communicative friend having announced all the remarkable characters of both sexes that appeared at court we resolved to adjourn and retired at the foot of the staircase there was a crowd of lacqueys and chairmen and in the midst of them stood humphry clinker exalted upon a stool with his hat in one hand and a paper in the other in the act of holding forth to the peoplebefore we could inquire into the meaning of this exhibition he perceived his master thrust the paper into his pocket descended from his elevation bolted through the crowd and brought up the carriage to the gate  my uncle said nothing till we were seated when after having looked at me earnestly for some time he burst out alaughing and asked if i knew upon what subject clinker was holding forth to the mobif said he the fellow is turned mountebank i must turn him out of my service otherwise hell make merry andrews of us alli observed that in all probability he had studied medicine under his master who was a farrier  at dinner the squire asked him if he had ever practised physic yes and please your honour said he among brute beasts but i never meddle with rational creatures i know not whether you rank in that class the audience you was haranguing in the court at st jamess but i should be glad to know what kind of powders you was distributing and whether you had a good salesale sir cried clinker i hope i shall never be base enough to sell for gold and silver what freely comes of gods grace i distributed nothing an like your honour but a word of advice to my fellows in servitude and sin advice concerning what concerning profane swearing an please your honour so horrid and shocking that it made my hair stand on end nay if thou canst cure them of that disease i shall think thee a wonderful doctor indeed why not cure them my good master the hearts of those poor people are not so stubborn as your honour seems to thinkmake them first sensible that you have nothing in view but their good then they will listen with patience and easily be convinced of the sin and folly of a practice that affords neither profit nor pleasureat this remark our uncle changed colour and looked round the company conscious that his own withers were not altogether unwrung but clinker said he if you should have eloquence enough to persuade the vulgar to resign those tropes and figures of rhetoric there will be little or nothing left to distinguish their conversation from that of their betters but then your honour knows their conversation will be void of offence and at the day of judgment there will be no distinction of persons  humphry going down stairs to fetch up a bottle of wine my uncle congratulated his sister upon having such a reformer in the family when mrs tabitha declared he was a sober civilized fellow very respectful and very industrious and she believed a good christian into the bargain one would think clinker must really have some very extraordinary talent to ingratiate himself in this manner with a virago of her character so fortified against him with prejudice and resentment but the truth is since the adventure of salthill mrs tabby seems to be entirely changed she has left off scolding the servants an exercise which was grown habitual and even seemed necessary to her constitution and is become so indifferent to chowder as to part with him in a present to lady griskin who proposes to bring the breed of him into fashion her ladyship is the widow of sir timothy griskin a distant relation of our family she enjoys a jointure of five hundred pounds ayear and makes shift to spend three times that sum her character before marriage was a little equivocal but at present she lives in the bon ton keeps cardtables gives private suppers to select friends and is visited by persons of the first fashionshe has been remarkably civil to us all and cultivates my uncle with the most particular regard but the more she strokes him the more his bristles seem to riseto her compliments he makes very laconic and dry returnstother day she sent us a pottle of fine strawberries which he did not receive without signs of disgust muttering from the aeneid timeo danaos et dona ferentes she has twice called for liddy of a forenoon to take an airing in the coach but mrs tabby was always so alert i suppose by his direction that she never could have the niece without her aunts company i have endeavoured to sound squaretoes on this subject but he carefully avoids all explanation  i have now dear phillips filled a whole sheet and if you have read it to an end i dare say you are as tired as  your humble servant j melford london june       to dr lewis  yes doctor i have seen the british museum which is a noble collection and even stupendous if we consider it was made by a private man a physician who was obliged to make his own for tune at the same time but great as the collection is it would appear more striking if it was arranged in one spacious saloon instead of being divided into different apartments which it does not entirely filli could wish the series of medals was connected and the whole of the animal vegetable and mineral kingdoms completed by adding to each at the public expence those articles that are wanting it would likewise be a great improvement with respect to the library if the deficiencies were made up by purchasing all the books of character that are not to be found already in the collectionthey might be classed in centuries according to the dates of their publication and catalogues printed of them and the manuscripts for the information of those that want to consult or compile from such authorities i could also wish for the honour of the nation that there was a complete apparatus for a course of mathematics mechanics and experimental philosophy and a good salary settled upon an able professor who should give regular lectures on these subjects  but this is all idle speculation which will never be reduced to practiceconsidering the temper of the times it is a wonder to see any institution whatsoever established for the benefit of the public the spirit of party is risen to a kind of phrenzy unknown to former ages or rather degenerated to a total extinction of honesty and candouryou know i have observed for some time that the public papers are become the infamous vehicles of the most cruel and perfidious defamation every rancorous knave every desperate incendiary that can afford to spend half a crown or three shillings may skulk behind the press of a newsmonger and have a stab at the first character in the kingdom without running the least hazard of detection or punishment  i have made acquaintance with a mr barton whom jery knew at oxford a good sort of a man though most ridiculously warped in his political principles but his partiality is the less offensive as it never appears in the stile of scurrility and abuse he is a member of parliament and a retainer to the court and his whole conversation turns upon the virtues and perfections of the ministers who are his patrons tother day when he was bedaubing one of those worthies with the most fulsome praise i told him i had seen the same nobleman characterised very differently in one of the dailypapers indeed so stigmatized that if one half of what was said of him was true he must be not only unfit to rule but even unfit to live that those impeachments had been repeated again and again with the addition of fresh matter and that as he had taken no steps towards his own vindication i began to think there was some foundation for the charge and pray sir said mr barton what steps would you have him take suppose he should prosecute the publisher who screens the anonymous accuser and bring him to the pillory for a libel this is so far from being counted a punishment in terrorem that it will probably make his fortune the multitude immediately take him into their protection as a martyr to the cause of defamation which they have always espoused they pay his fine they contribute to the increase of his stock his shop is crowded with customers and the sale of his paper rises in proportion to the scandal it contains all this time the prosecutor is inveighed against as a tyrant and oppressor for having chosen to proceed by the way of information which is deemed a grievance but if he lays an action for damages he must prove the damage and i leave you to judge whether a gentlemans character may not be brought into contempt and all his views in life blasted by calumny without his being able to specify the particulars of the damage he has sustained  this spirit of defamation is a kind of heresy that thrives under persecution the liberty of the press is a term of great efficacy and like that of the protestant religion has often served the purposes of seditiona minister therefore must arm himself with patience and bear those attacks without repiningwhatever mischief they may do in other respects they certainly contribute in one particular to the advantages of government for those defamatory articles have multiplied papers in such a manner and augmented their sale to such a degree that the duty upon stamps and advertisements has made a very considerable addition to the revenue certain it is a gentlemans honour is a very delicate subject to be handled by a jury composed of men who cannot be supposed remarkable either for sentiment or impartialityin such a case indeed the defendant is tried not only by his peers but also by his party and i really think that of all patriots he is the most resolute who exposes himself to such detraction for the sake of his countryif from the ignorance or partiality of juries a gentleman can have no redress from law for being defamed in a pamphlet or newspaper i know but one other method of proceeding against the publisher which is attended with some risque but has been practised successfully more than once in my remembrancea regiment of horse was represented in one of the newspapers as having misbehaved at dettingen a captain of that regiment broke the publishers bones telling him at the same time if he went to law he should certainly have the like salutation from every officer of the corps governortook the same satisfaction on the ribs of an author who traduced him by name in a periodical paperi know a low fellow of the same class who being turned out of venice for his impudence and scurrility retired to lugano a town of the grisons a free people god wot where he found a printing press from whence he squirted his filth at some respectable characters in the republic which he had been obliged to abandon some of these finding him out of the reach of legal chastisement employed certain useful instruments such as may be found in all countries to give him the bastinado which being repeated more than once effectually stopt the current of his abuse  as for the liberty of the press like every other privilege it must be restrained within certain bounds for if it is carried to a branch of law religion and charity it becomes one of the greatest evils that ever annoyed the community if the lowest ruffian may stab your good name with impunity in england will you be so uncandid as to exclaim against italy for the practice of common assassination to what purpose is our property secured if our moral character is left defenceless people thus baited grow desperate and the despair of being able to preserve ones character untainted by such vermin produces a total neglect of fame so that one of the chief incitements to the practice of virtue is effectually destroyed  mr bartons last consideration respecting the stampduty is equally wise and laudable with another maxim which has been long adopted by our financiers namely to connive at drunkenness riot and dissipation because they inhance the receipt of the excise not reflecting that in providing this temporary convenience they are destroying the morals health and industry of the peoplenotwithstanding my contempt for those who flatter a minister i think there is something still more despicable in flattering a mob when i see a man of birth education and fortune put himself on a level with the dregs of the people mingle with low mechanics feed with them at the same board and drink with them in the same cup flatter their prejudices harangue in praise of their virtues expose themselves to the belchings of their beer the fumes of their tobacco the grossness of their familiarity and the impertinence of their conversation i cannot help despising him as a man guilty of the vilest prostitution in order to effect a purpose equally selfish and illiberal  i should renounce politics the more willingly if i could find other topics of conversation discussed with more modesty and candour but the daemon of party seems to have usurped every department of life even the world of literature and taste is divided into the most virulent factions which revile decry and traduce the works of one another yesterday i went to return an afternoons visit to a gentleman of my acquaintance at whose house i found one of the authors of the present age who has written with some successas i had read one or two of his performances which gave me pleasure i was glad of this opportunity to know his person but his discourse and deportment destroyed all the impressions which his writings had made in his favour he took upon him to decide dogmatically upon every subject without deigning to shew the least cause for his differing from the general opinions of mankind as if it had been our duty to acquiesce in the ipse dixit of this new pythagoras he rejudged the characters of all the principal authors who had died within a century of the present time and in this revision paid no sort of regard to the reputation they had acquiredmilton was harsh and prosaic dryden languid and verbose butler and swift without humour congreve without wit and pope destitute of any sort of poetical meritas for his contemporaries he could not bear to hear one of them mentioned with any degree of applausethey were all dunces pedants plagiaries quacks and impostors and you could not name a single performance but what was tame stupid and insipid it must be owned that this writer had nothing to charge his conscience with on the side of flattery for i understand he was never known to praise one line that was written even by those with whom he lived on terms of good fellowship this arrogance and presumption in depreciating authors for whose reputation the company may be interested is such an insult upon the understanding as i could not bear without wincing  i desired to know his reasons for decrying some works which had afforded me uncommon pleasure and as demonstration did not seem to be his talent i dissented from his opinion with great freedom having been spoiled by the deference and humility of his hearers he did not bear contradiction with much temper and the dispute might have grown warm had it not been interrupted by the entrance of a rival bard at whose appearance he always quits the placethey are of different cabals and have been at open war these twenty yearsif the other was dogmatical this genius was declamatory he did not discourse but harangue and his orations were equally tedious and turgid he too pronounces ex cathedra upon the characters of his contemporaries and though he scruples not to deal out praise even lavishly to the lowest reptile in grubstreet who will either flatter him in private or mount the public rostrum as his panegyrist he damns all the other writers of the age with the utmost insolence and rancourone is a blunderbuss as being a native of ireland another a halfstarved louse of literature from the banks of the tweed a third an ass because he enjoys a pension from the government a fourth the very angel of dulness because he succeeded in a species of writing in which this aristarchus had failed a fifth who presumed to make strictures upon one of his performances he holds as a bug in criticism whose stench is more offensive than his stingin short except himself and his myrmidons there is not a man of genius or learning in the three kingdoms as for the success of those who have written without the pale of this confederacy he imputes it entirely to want of taste in the public not considering that to the approbation of that very tasteless public he himself owes all the consequence he has in life  those originals are not fit for conversation if they would maintain the advantage they have gained by their writing they should never appear but upon paperfor my part i am shocked to find a man have sublime ideas in his head and nothing but illiberal sentiments in his heartthe human soul will be generally found most defective in the article of candouri am inclined to think no mind was ever wholly exempt from envy which perhaps may have been implanted as an instinct essential to our nature i am afraid we sometimes palliate this vice under the spacious name of emulation i have known a person remarkably generous humane moderate and apparently selfdenying who could not hear even a friend commended without betraying marks of uneasiness as if that commendation had implied an odious comparison to his prejudice and every wreath of praise added to the others character was a garland plucked from his own temples this is a malignant species of jealousy of which i stand acquitted in my own conscience  whether it is a vice or an infirmity i leave you to inquire  there is another point which i would much rather see determined whether the world was always as contemptible as it appears to me at presentif the morals of mankind have not contracted an extraordinary degree of depravity within these thirty years then must i be infected with the common vice of old men difficilis querulus laudator temporis acti or which is more probable the impetuous pursuits and avocations of youth have formerly hindered me from observing those rotten parts of human nature which now appear so offensively to my observation  we have been at court and change and every where and every where we find food

playill be hanged if she is not acting a part which is not natural to her disposition for some purpose which i have not yet discovered  with respect to the characters of mankind my curiosity is quite satisfied i have done with the science of men and must now endeavour to amuse myself with the novelty of things i am at present by a violent effort of the mind forced from my natural bias but this power ceasing to act i shall return to my solitude with redoubled velocity every thing i see and hear and feel in this great reservoir of folly knavery and sophistication contributes to inhance the value of a country life in the sentiments of  yours always matt bramble london june       to mrs mary jones at brambletonhall  dear mary jones  lady griskins botler mr crumb having got squire barton

uncles design of going to the duke of ns levee which design has been executed accordingly his grace has been so long accustomed to this kind of homage that though the place he now fills does not imply the tenth part of the influence which he exerted in his former office he has given his friends to understand that they cannot oblige him in any thing more than in contributing to support the shadow of that power which he no longer retains in substance and therefore he has still public days on which they appear at his levee  my uncle and i went thither with mr barton who being one of the dukes adherents undertook to be our introducerthe room was pretty well filled with people in a great variety of dress but there was no more than one gown and cassock though i was told his grace had while he was minister preferred almost every individual that now filled the bench of bishops in the house of lords but in all probability the gratitude of the clergy is like their charity which shuns the lightmr barton was immediately accosted by a person well stricken in years tall and rawboned with a hooknose and an arch leer that indicated at least as much cunning as sagacity our conductor saluted him by the name of captain c and afterwards informed us he was a man of shrewd parts whom the government occasionally employed in secret services but i have had the history of him more at large from another quarter he had been many years ago concerned in fraudulent practices as a merchant in france and being convicted of some of them was sent to the gallies from whence he was delivered by the interest of the late duke of ormond to whom he had recommended himself in letter as his namesake and relationhe was in the sequel employed by our ministry as a spy and in the war of    0 traversed all spain as well as france in the disguise of a capuchin at the extreme hazard of his life in as much as the court of madrid had actually got scent of him and given orders to apprehend him at st sebastians from whence he had fortunately retired but a few hours before the order arrived this and other hairbreadth scapes he pleaded so effectually as a merit with the english ministry that they allowed him a comfortable pension which he now enjoys in his old agehe has still access to all the ministers and is said to be consulted by them on many subjects as a man of uncommon understanding and great experiencehe is in fact a fellow of some parts and invincible assurance and in his discourse he assumes such an air of selfsufficiency as may very well impose upon some of the shallow politicians who now labour at the helm of administration but if he is not belied this is not the only imposture of which he is guiltythey say he is at bottom not only a romancatholic but really a priest and while he pretends to disclose to our statepilots all the springs that move the cabinet of versailles he is actually picking up intelligence for the service of the french minister be that as it may captain c entered into conversation with us in the most familiar manner and treated the dukes character without any ceremonythis wiseacre said he is still abed and i think the best thing he can do is to sleep on till christmas for when he gets up he does nothing but expose his own follysince grenville was turned out there has been no minister in this nation worth the meal that whitened his periwigthey are so ignorant they scarce know a crab from a cauliflower and then they are such dunces that theres no making them comprehend the plainest propositionin the beginning of the war this poor halfwitted creature told me in a great fright that thirty thousand french had marched from acadie to cape bretonwhere did they find transports said i  transports cried he i tell you they marched by landby land to the island of cape breton what is cape breton an island certainly  ha are you sure of that when i pointed it out in the map he examined it earnestly with his spectacles then taking me in his arms my dear c cried he you always bring us good newsegad ill go directly and tell the king that cape breton is an island  he seemed disposed to entertain us with more anecdotes of this nature at the expense of his grace when he was interrupted by the arrival of the algerine ambassador a venerable turk with a long white beard attended by his dragoman or interpreter and another officer of his household who had got no stockings to his legscaptain c immediately spoke with an air of authority to a servant in waiting bidding him go and tell the duke to rise as there was a great deal of company come and among others the ambassador from algiers then turning to us this poor turk said he notwithstanding his grey beard is a greenhornhe has been several years resident in london and still is ignorant of our political revolutions this visit is intended for the prime minister of england but youll see how this wise duke will receive it as a mark of attachment to his own personcertain it is the duke seemed eager to acknowledge the complimenta door opened he suddenly bolted out with a shavingcloth under his chin his face frothed up to the eyes with soap lather and running up to the ambassador grinned hideous in his facemy dear mahomet said he god love your long beard i hope the dey will make you a horsetail at the next promotion ha ha ha have but a moments patience and ill send to you in a twinklingso saying he retired into his den leaving the turk in some confusion after a short pause however he said something to his interpreter the meaning of which i had great curiosity to know as he turned up his eyes while he spoke expressing astonishment mixed with devotion we were gratified by means of the communicative captain c who conversed with the dragoman as an old acquaintance ibrahim the ambassador who had mistaken his grace for the ministers fool was no sooner undeceived by the interpreter than he exclaimed to this effect holy prophet i dont wonder that this nation prospers seeing it is governed by the counsel of ideots a series of men whom all good mussulmen revere as the organs of immediate inspiration ibrahim was favoured with a particular audience of short duration after which the duke conducted him to the door and then returned to diffuse his gracious looks among the crowd of his worshippers  as mr barton advanced to present me to his grace it was my fortune to attract his notice before i was announcedhe forthwith met me more than half way and seizing me by the hand my dear sir francis cried he this is so kindi vow to god i am so obligedsuch attention to a poor broken minister wellpray when does your excellency set sailfor gods sake have a care of your health and cat stewed prunes in the passage next to your own precious health pray my dear excellency take care of the five nationsour good friends the five nations the toryrories the maccolmacks the outotheways the crickets and the kickshawslet em have plenty of blankets and stinkubus and wampum and your excellency wont fail to scour the kettle and boil the chain and bury the tree and plant the hatchetha ha ha when he had uttered this rhapsody with his usual precipitation mr barton gave him to understand that i was neither sir francis nor st francis but simply mr melford nephew to mr bramble who stepping forward made his bow at the same time odso no more it is sir francissaid this wise statesman mr melford im glad to see youi sent you an engineer to fortify your dockmr brambleyour servant mr bramblehow dye good mr bramble your nephew is a pretty young fellowfaith and troth a very pretty fellowhis father is my old friendhow does he hold it still troubled with that damned disorder ha no my lord replied my uncle all his troubles are overhe has been dead these fifteen years dead howyes faith now i remember he is dead sure enoughwell and howdoes the young gentleman stand for haverford west ora what dye my dear mr milfordhaven ill do you all the service in my power i hope i have some credit leftmy uncle then gave him to understand that i was still a minor and that we had no intention to trouble him at present for any favour whatsoeveri came hither with my nephew added he to pay our respects to your grace and i may venture to say that his views and mine are at least as disinterested as those of any individual in this assembly my dear mr brambleberry you do me infinite honouri shall always rejoice to see you and your hopeful nephew mr milfordhavenmy credit such as it is you may commandi wish we had more friends of your kidney  then turning to captain c ha c said he what news c how does the world wag ha the world wags much after the old fashion my lord answered the captain the politicians of london and westminster have begun again to wag their tongues against your grace and your shortlived popularity wags like a feather which the next puff of antiministerial calumny will blow awaya pack of rascals cried the duketories jacobites rebels one half of them would wag their heels at tyburn if they had their desertsso saying he wheeled about and going round the levee spoke to every individual with the most courteous familiarity but he scarce ever opened his mouth without making some blunder in relation to the person or business of the party with whom he conversed so that he really looked like a comedian hired to burlesque the character of a ministerat length a person of a very prepossessing appearance coming in his grace ran up and hugging him in his arms with the appellation of my dear chs led him forthwith into the inner apartment or sanctum sanctorum of this political temple that said captain c is my friend c t almost the only man of parts who has any concern in the present administrationindeed he would have no concern at all in the matter if the ministry did not find it absolutely necessary to make use of his talents upon some particular occasionsas for the common business of the nation it is carried on in a constant routine by the clerks of the different offices otherwise the wheels of government would be wholly stopt amidst the abrupt succession of ministers every one more ignorant than his predecessori am thinking what a fine hovel we should be in if all the clerks of the treasury the secretaries of the waroffice and the admiralty should take it in their heads to throw up their places in imitation of the great pensionerbut to return to c t he certainly knows more than all the ministry and all the opposition if their heads were laid together and talks like an angel on a vast variety of subjects he would really be a great man if he had any consistency or stability of characterthen it must be owned he wants courage otherwise he would never allow himself to be cowed by the great political bully for whose understanding he has justly a very great contempt i have seen him as much afraid of that overbearing hector as ever schoolboy was of his pedagogue and yet this hector i shrewdly suspect is no more than a craven at bottombesides this defect c has another which he is at too little pains to hidetheres no faith to be given to his assertions and no trust to be put in his promiseshowever to give the devil his due hes very goodnatured and even friendly when close urged in the way of solicitationas for principle thats out of the questionin a word he is a wit and an orator extremely entertaining and he shines very often at the expence even of those ministers to whom he is a retainer this is a mark of great imprudence by which he has made them all his enemies whatever face they may put upon the matter and sooner or later hell have cause to wish he had been able to keep his own counsel i have several times cautioned him on this subject but tis all preaching to the deserthis vanity runs away with his discretioni could not help thinking the captain himself might have been the better for some hints of the same naturehis panegyric excluding principle and veracity puts me in mind of a contest i once overheard in the way of altercation betwixt two applewomen in springgardenone of those viragos having hinted something to the prejudice of the others moral character her antagonist setting her hands in her sides repliedspeak out hussyi scorn your malicei own im both a whore and a thief and what more have you to saydamn you what more have you to say baiting that which all the world knows i challenge you to say black is the white of my eyewe did not wait for mr ts coming forth but after captain c had characterised all the originals in waiting we adjourned to a coffeehouse where we had buttered muffins and tea to breakfast the said captain still favouring us with his companynay my uncle was so diverted with his anecdotes that he asked him to dinner and treated him with a fine turbot to which he did ample justicethat same evening i spent at the tavern with some friends one of whom let me into cs character which mr bramble no sooner understood than he expressed some concern for the connexion he had made and resolved to disengage himself from it without ceremony  we are become members of the society for the encouragement of the arts and have assisted at some of their deliberations which were conducted with equal spirit and sagacitymy uncle is extremely fond of the institution which will certainly be productive of great advantages to the public if from its democratical form it does not degenerate into cabal and corruptionyou are already acquainted with his aversion to the influence of the multitude which he affirms is incompatible with excellence and subversive of orderindeed his detestation of the mob has been heightened by fear ever since he fainted in the room at bath and this apprehension has prevented him from going to the little theatre in the haymarket and other places of entertainment to which however i have had the honour to attend the ladies  it grates old squaretoes to reflect that it is not in his power to enjoy even the most elegant diversions of the capital without the participation of the vulgar for they now thrust themselves into all assemblies from a ridotto at st jamess to a hop at rotherhithe i have lately seen our old acquaintance dick ivy who we imagined had died of dramdrinking but he is lately emerged from the fleet by means of a pamphlet which he wrote and published against the government with some success the sale of this performance enabled him to appear in clean linen and he is now going about soliciting subscriptions for his poems but his breeches are not yet in the most decent order  dick certainly deserves some countenance for his intrepidity and perseveranceit is not in the power of disappointment nor even of damnation to drive him to despairafter some unsuccessful essays in the way of poetry he commenced brandymerchant and i believe his whole stock ran out through his own bowels then he consorted with a milkwoman who kept a cellar in petty france but he could not make his quarters good he was dislodged and driven up stairs into the kennel by a corporal in the second regiment of footguardshe was afterwards the laureat of blackfriars from whence there was a natural transition to the fleetas he had formerly miscarried in panegyric he now turned his thoughts to satire and really seems to have some talent for abuse if he can hold out till the meeting of the parliament and be prepared for another charge in all probability dick will mount the pillory or obtain a pension in either of which events his fortune will be mademean while he has acquired some degree of consideration with the respectable writers of the age and as i have subscribed for his works he did me the favour tother night to introduce me to a society of those geniuses but i found them exceedingly formal and reservedthey seemed afraid and jealous of one another and sat in a state of mutual repulsion like so many particles of vapour each surrounded by its own electrified atmosphere dick who has more vivacity than judgment tried more than once to enliven the conversation sometimes making an effort at wit sometimes letting off a pun and sometimes discharging a conundrum nay at length he started a dispute upon the hackneyed comparison betwixt blank verse and rhyme and the professors opened with great clamour but instead of keeping to the subject they launched out into tedious dissertations on the poetry of the ancients and one of them who had been a schoolmaster displayed his whole knowledge of prosody gleaned from disputer and ruddiman at last i ventured to say i did not see how the subject in question could be at all elucidated by the practice of the ancients who certainly had neither blank verse nor rhyme in their poems which were measured by feet whereas ours are reckoned by the number of syllablesthis remark seemed to give umbrage to the pedant who forthwith involved himself in a cloud of greek and latin quotations which nobody attempted to dispela confused hum of insipid observations and comments ensued and upon the whole i never passed a duller evening in my lifeyet without all doubt some of them were men of learning wit and ingenuity as they are afraid of making free with one another they should bring each his butt or whetstone along with him for the entertainment of the companymy uncle says he never desires to meet with more than one wit at a timeone wit like a knuckle of ham in soup gives a zest and flavour to the dish but more than one serves only to spoil the pottageand now im afraid i have given you an unconscionable mess without any flavour at all for which i suppose you will bestow your benedictions upon  your friend and servant j melford london june       to dr lewis  dear lewis  your fable of the monkey and the pig is what the italians call ben trovata but i shall not repeat it to my apothecary who is a proud scotchman very thin skinned and for aught i know may have his degree in his pocketa right scotchman has always two strings to his bow and is in utrumque paratuscertain it is i have not scaped a scouring but i believe by means of that scouring i have scaped something worse perhaps a tedious fit of the gout or rheumatism for my appetite began to flag and i had certain croakings in the bowels which boded me no goodnay i am not yet quite free of these remembrances which warn me to be gone from this centre of infection  what temptation can a man of my turn and temperament have to live in a place where every corner teems with fresh objects of detestation and disgust what kind of taste and organs must those people have who really prefer the adulterate enjoyments of the town to the genuine pleasures of a country retreat most people i know are originally seduced by vanity ambition and childish curiosity which cannot be gratified but in the busy haunts of men but in the course of this gratification their very organs of sense are perverted and they become habitually lost to every relish of what is genuine and excellent in its own nature  shall i state the difference between my town grievances and my country comforts at brambletonhall i have elbowroom

doors when the weather will not permit me to go abroadi read and chat and play at billiards cards or backgammonwithout doors i superintend my farm and execute plans of improvements the effects of which i enjoy with unspeakable delightnor do i take less pleasure in seeing my tenants thrive under my auspices and the poor live comfortably by the employment which i provideyou know i have one or two sensible friends to whom i can open all my heart a blessing which perhaps i might have sought in vain among the crowded scenes of life there are a few others of more humble parts whom i esteem for their integrity and their conversation i find inoffensive though not very entertaining finally i live in the midst of honest men and trusty dependents who i flatter myself have a disinterested attachment to my person you yourself my dear doctor can vouch for the truth of these assertions  now mark the contrast at londoni am pent up in frowzy lodgings where there is not room enough to swing a cat and i breathe the steams of endless putrefaction and these would undoubtedly produce a pestilence if they were not qualified by the gross acid of seacoal which is itself a pernicious nuisance to lungs of any delicacy of texture but even this boasted corrector cannot prevent those languid sallow looks that distinguish the inhabitants of london from those ruddy swains that lead a countrylifei go to bed after midnight jaded and restless from the dissipations of the dayi start every hour from my sleep at the horrid noise of the watchmen bawling the hour through every street and thundering at every door a set of useless fellows who serve no other purpose but that of disturbing the repose of the inhabitants and by five oclock i start out of bed in consequence of the still more dreadful alarm made by the country carts and noisy rustics bellowing green pease under my window if i would drink water i must quaff the maukish contents of an open aqueduct exposed to all manner of defilement or swallow that which comes from the river thames impregnated with all the filth of london and westminsterhuman excrement is the least offensive part of the concrete which is composed of all the drugs minerals and poisons used in mechanics and manufacture enriched with the putrefying carcasses of beasts and men and mixed with the scourings of all the washtubs kennels and common sewers within the bills of mortality  this is the agreeable potation extolled by the londoners as the finest water in the universeas to the intoxicating potion sold for wine it is a vile unpalatable and pernicious sophistication balderdashed with cyder cornspirit and the juice of sloes in an action at law laid against a carman for having staved a cask of port it appeared from the evidence of the cooper that there were not above five gallons of real wine in the whole pipe which held above a hundred and even that had been brewed and adulterated by the merchant at oporto the bread i cat in london is a deleterious paste mixed up with chalk alum and boneashes insipid to the taste and destructive to the constitution the good people are not ignorant of this adulterationbut they prefer it to wholesome bread because it is whiter than the meal of corn thus they sacrifice their taste and their health and the lives of their tender infants to a most absurd gratification of a misjudging eye and the miller or the baker is obliged to poison them and their families in order to live by his profession the same monstrous depravity appears in their veal which is bleached by repeated bleedings and other villainous arts till there is not a drop of juice left in the body and the poor animal is paralytic before it dies so void of all taste nourishment and savour that a man might dine as comfortably on a white fricassee of kidskin gloves or chip hats from leghorn  as they have discharged the natural colour from their bread their butchersmeat and poultry their cutlets ragouts fricassees and sauces of all kinds so they insist upon having the complexion of their potherbs mended even at the hazard of their lives perhaps you will hardly believe they can be so mad as to boil their greens with brass halfpence in order to improve their colour and yet nothing is more trueindeed without this improvement in the colour they have no personal merit they are produced in an artificial soil and taste of nothing but the dunghills from whence they spring my cabbage cauliflower and sparagus in the country are as much superior in flavour to those that are sold in coventgarden as my heathmutton is to that of st jamessmarket which in fact is neither lamb nor mutton but something betwixt the two gorged in the rank fens of lincoln and essex pale coarse and frowzyas for the pork it is an abominable carnivorous animal fed with horseflesh and distillers grains and the poultry is all rotten in consequence of a fever occasioned by the infamous practice of sewing up the gut that they may be the sooner fattened in coops in consequence of this cruel retention  of the fish i need say nothing in this hot weather but that it comes sixty seventy fourscore and a hundred miles by landcarriage a circumstance sufficient without any comment to turn a dutchmans stomach even if his nose was not saluted in every alley with the sweet flavour of fresh mackarel selling by retail this is not the season for oysters nevertheless it may not be amiss to mention that the right colchester are kept in slimepits occasionally overflowed by the sea and that the green colour so much admired by the voluptuaries of this metropolis is occasioned by the vitriolic scum which rises on the surface of the stagnant and stinking waterour rabbits are bred and fed in the poulterers cellar where they have neither air nor exercise consequently they must be firm in flesh and delicious in flavour and there is no game to be had for love or money  it must be owned the coventgarden affords some good fruit which however is always engrossed by a few individuals of overgrown fortune at an exorbitant price so that little else than the refuse of the market falls to the share of the community and that is distributed by such filthy hands as i cannot look at without loathing it was but yesterday that i saw a dirty barrowbunter in the street cleaning her dusty fruit with her own spittle and who knows but some fine lady of st jamess parish might admit into her delicate mouth those very cherries which had been rolled and moistened between the filthy and perhaps ulcerated chops of a st giless hucksteri need not dwell upon the pallid contaminated mash which they call strawberries soiled and tossed by greasy paws through twenty baskets crusted with dirt and then presented with the worst milk thickened with the worst flour into a bad likeness of cream but the milk itself should not pass unanalysed the produce of faded cabbageleaves and sour draff lowered with hot water frothed with bruised snails carried through the streets in open pails exposed to foul rinsings discharged from doors and windows spittle snot and tobaccoquids from foot passengers overflowings from mud carts spatterings from coach wheels dirt and trash chucked into it by roguish boys for the jokes sake the spewings of infants who have slabbered in the tinmeasure which is thrown back in that condition among the milk for the benefit of the next customer and finally the vermin that drops from the rags of the nasty drab that vends this precious mixture under the respectable denomination of milkmaid  i shall conclude this catalogue of london dainties with that tablebeer guiltless of hops and malt vapid and nauseous much fitter to facilitate the operation of a vomit than to quench thirst and promote digestion the tallowy rancid mass called butter manufactured with candle grease and kitchen stuff and their fresh eggs imported from france and scotlandnow all these enormities might be remedied with a very little attention to the article of police or civil regulation but the wise patriots of london have taken it into their heads that all regulation is inconsistent with liberty and that every man ought to live in his own way without restraintnay as there is not sense enough left among them to be discomposed by the nuisance i have mentioned they may for aught i care wallow in the mire of their own pollution  a companionable man will undoubtedly put up with many inconveniences for the sake of enjoying agreeable society a facetious friend of mine used to say the wine could not be bad where the company was agreeable a maxim which however ought to be taken cum grano salis but what is the society of london that i should be tempted for its sake to mortify my senses and compound with such uncleanness as my soul abhors all the people i see are too much engrossed by schemes of interest or ambition to have any room left for sentiment or friendship even in some of my old acquaintance those schemes and pursuits have obliterated all traces of our former connexionconversation is reduced to party disputes and illiberal altercationsocial commerce to formal visits and cardplayingif you pick up a diverting original by accident it may be dangerous to amuse yourself with his odditieshe is generally a tartar at bottom a sharper a spy or a lunatic every person you deal with endeavours to overreach you in the way of business you are preyed upon by idle mendicants who beg in the phrase of borrowing and live upon the spoils of the strangeryour tradesmen are without conscience your friends without affection and your dependents without fidelity  my letter would swell into a treatise were i to particularize every cause of offence that fills up the measure of my aversion to this and every other crowded citythank heaven i am not so far sucked into the vortex but that i can disengage myself without any great effort of philosophyfrom this wild uproar of knavery folly and impertinence i shall fly with double relish to the serenity of retirement the cordial effusions of unreserved friendship the hospitality and protection of the rural gods in a word the jucunda oblivia vitae which horace himself had not taste enough to enjoy  i have agreed for a good travellingcoach and four at a guinea a day for three months certain and next week we intend to begin our journey to the north hoping still to be with you by the latter end of octoberi shall continue to write from every stage where we make any considerable halt as often as anything occurs which i think can afford you the least amusement in the mean time i must beg you will superintend the oeconomy of barns with respect to my hay and corn harvests assured that my ground produces nothing but what you may freely call your ownon any other terms i should be ashamed to subscribe myself  your unvariable friend matt bramble london june       to sir watkin phillips bart of jesus college oxon  dear phillips  in my last i mentioned my having spent an evening with a society of authors who seemed to be jealous and afraid of one another my uncle was not at all surprised to hear me say i was disappointed in their conversation a man may be very entertaining and instructive upon paper said he and exceedingly dull in common discourse i have observed that those who shine most in private company are but secondary stars in the constellation of geniusa small stock of ideas is more easily managed and sooner displayed than a great quantity crowded together there is very seldom any thing extraordinary in the appearance and address of a good writer whereas a dull author generally distinguishes himself by some oddity or extravagance for this reason i fancy that an assembly of grubs must be very diverting  my curiosity being excited by this hint i consulted my friend dick ivy who undertook to gratify it the very next day which was sunday last he carried me to dine with s whom you and i have long known by his writingshe lives in the skirts of the town and every sunday his house is opened to all unfortunate brothers of the quill whom he treats with beef pudding and potatoes port punch and calverts entire butt beer he has fixed upon the first day of the week for the exercise of his hospitality because some of his guests could not enjoy it on any other for reasons that i need not explain i was civilly received in a plain yet decent habitation which opened backwards into a very pleasant garden kept in excellent order and indeed i saw none of the outward signs of authorship either in the house or the landlord who is one of those few writers of the age that stand upon their own foundation without patronage and above dependence if there was nothing characteristic in the entertainer the company made ample amends for his want of singularity  at two in the afternoon i found myself one of ten messmates seated at table and i question if the whole kingdom could produce such another assemblage of originals among their peculiarities i do not mention those of dress which may be purely accidental what struck me were oddities originally produced by affectation and afterwards confirmed by habit one of them wore spectacles at dinner and another his hat flapped though as ivy told me the first was noted for having a seamans eye when a bailiff was in the wind and the other was never known to labour under any weakness or defect of vision except about five years ago when he was complimented with a couple of black eyes by a player with whom he had quarrelled in his drink a third wore a laced stocking and made use of crutches because once in his life he had been laid up with a broken leg though no man could leap over a stick with more agility a fourth had contracted such an antipathy to the country that he insisted upon sitting with his back towards the window that looked into the garden and when a dish of cauliflower was set upon the table he snuffed up volatile salts to keep him from fainting yet this delicate person was the son of a cottager born under a hedge and had many years run wild among asses on a common a fifth affected distraction when spoke to he always answered from the purpose sometimes he suddenly started up and rapped out a dreadful oath sometimes he burst out alaughingthen he folded his arms and sighed and then he hissed like fifty serpents  at first i really thought he was mad and as he sat near me began to be under some apprehensions for my own safety when our landlord perceiving me alarmed assured me aloud that i had nothing to fear the gentleman said he is trying to act a part for which he is by no means qualifiedif he had all the inclination in the world it is not in his power to be mad his spirits are too flat to be kindled into frenzy tis no bad pppuff however observed a person in a tarnished laced coat affffected inmadness wwill ppass for wwit wwith nineninetteen out of ttwentyand affected stuttering for humour replied our landlord tho god knows there is an affinity betwixt them it seems this wag after having made some abortive attempts in plain speaking had recourse to this defect by means of which he frequently extorted the laugh of the company without the least expence of genius and that imperfection which he had at first counterfeited was now become so habitual that he could not lay it aside  a certain winking genius who wore yellow gloves at dinner had on his first introduction taken such offence at s because he looked and talked and ate and drank like any other man that he spoke contemptuously of his understanding ever after and never would repeat his visit until he had exhibited the following proof of his caprice wat wyvil the poet having made some unsuccessful advances towards an intimacy with s at last gave him to understand by a third person that he had written a poem in his praise and a satire against his person that if he would admit him to his house the first should be immediately sent to press but that if he persisted in declining his friendship he would publish his satire without delay s replied that he looked upon wyvils panegyrick as in effect a species of infamy and would resent it accordingly with a good cudgel but if he published the satire he might deserve his compassion and had nothing to fear from his revenge wyvil having considered the alternative resolved to mortify s by printing the panegyrick for which he received a sound drubbing then he swore the peace against the aggressor who in order to avoid a prosecution at law admitted him to his good graces it was the singularity in ss conduct on this occasion that reconciled him to the yellowgloved philosopher who owned he had some genius and from that period cultivated his acquaintance  curious to know upon what subjects the several talents of my fellowguests were employed i applied to my communicative friend dick ivy who gave me to understand that most of them were or had been understrappers or journeymen to more creditable authors for whom they translated collated and compiled in the business of bookmaking and that all of them had at different times laboured in the service of our landlord though they had now set up for themselves in various departments of literature not only their talents but also their nations and dialects were so various that our conversation resembled the confusion of tongues at babel we had the irish brogue the scotch accent and foreign idiom twanged off by the most discordant vociferation for as they all spoke together no man had any chance to be heard unless he could bawl louder than his fellows it must be owned however there was nothing pedantic in their discourse they carefully avoided all learned disquisitions and endeavoured to be facetious nor did their endeavours always miscarrysome droll repartee passed and much laughter was excited and if any individual lost his temper so far as to transgress the bounds of decorum he was effectually checked by the master of the feast who exerted a sort of paternal authority over this irritable tribe  the most learned philosopher of the whole collection who had been expelled the university for atheism has made great progress in a refutation of lord bolingbrokes metaphysical works which is said to be equally ingenious and orthodox but in the mean time he has been presented to the grand jury as a public nuisance for having blasphemed in an alehouse on the lords day the scotchman gives lectures on the pronunciation of the english language which he is now publishing by subscription  the irishman is a political writer and goes by the name of my lord potatoe he wrote a pamphlet in vindication of a minister hoping his zeal would be rewarded with some place or pension but finding himself neglected in that quarter he whispered about that the pamphlet was written by the minister himself and he published an answer to his own production in this he addressed the author under the title of your lordship with such solemnity that the public swallowed the deceit and bought up the whole impression the wise politicians of the metropolis declared they were both masterly performances and chuckled over the flimsy reveries of an ignorant garretteer as the profound speculations of a veteran statesman acquainted with all the secrets of the cabinet the imposture was detected in the sequel and our hibernian pamphleteer retains no part of his assumed importance but the bare title of my lord and the upper part of the table at the potatoeordinary in shoelane  opposite to me sat a piedmontese who had obliged the public with a humorous satire intituled the ballance of the english poets a performance which evinced the great modesty and taste of the author and in particular his intimacy with the elegancies of the english language the sage who laboured under the agrophobia or horror of green fields had just finished a treatise on practical agriculture though in fact he had never seen corn growing in his life and was so ignorant of grain that our entertainer in the face of the whole company made him own that a plate of hominy was the best rice pudding he had ever eat  the stutterer had almost finished his travels through europe and part of asia without ever budging beyond the liberties of the kings bench except in termtime with a tipstaff for his companion and as for little tim cropdale the most facetious member of the whole society he had happily wound up the catastrophe of a virgin tragedy from the exhibition of which he promised himself a large fund of profit and reputation tim had made shift to live many years by writing novels at the rate of five pounds a volume but that branch of business is now engrossed by female authors who publish merely for the propagation of virtue with so much ease and spirit and delicacy and knowledge of the human heart and all in the serene tranquillity of high life that the reader is not only inchanted by their genius but reformed by their morality  after dinner we adjourned into the garden where i observed mr s gave a short separate audience to every individual in a small remote filbert walk from whence most of them dropt off one after another without further ceremony but they were replaced by fresh recruits of the same clan who came to make an afternoons visit and among others a spruce bookseller called birkin who rode his own gelding and made his appearance in a pair of new jemmy boots with massy spurs of plate it was not without reason that this midwife of the muses used exercise ahorseback for he was too fat to walk afoot and he underwent some sarcasms from tim cropdale on his unwieldy size and inaptitude for motion birkin who took umbrage at this poor authors petulance in presuming to joke upon a man so much richer than himself told him he was not so unwieldy but that he could move the marshalsea court for a writ and even overtake him with it if he did not very speedily come and settle accounts with him respecting the expence of publishing his last ode to the king of prussia of which he had sold but three and one of them was to whitfield the methodist tim affected to receive this intimation with good humour saying he expected in a post or two from potsdam a poem of thanks from his prussian majesty who knew very well how to pay poets in their own coin but in the mean time he proposed that mr birkin and he should run three times round the garden for a bowl of punch to be drank at ashleys in the evening and he would run boots against stockings the bookseller who valued himself upon his mettle was persuaded to accept the challenge and he forthwith resigned his boots to cropdale who when he had put them on was no bad representation of captain pistol in the play  every thing being adjusted they started together with great impetuosity and in the second round birkin had clearly the advantage larding the lean earth as he puffd along cropdale had no mind to contest the victory further but in a twinkling disappeared through the backdoor of the garden which opened into a private lane that had communication with the high roadthe spectators immediately began to hollow stole away and birkin set off in pursuit of him with great eagerness but he had not advanced twenty yards in the lane when a thorn running into his foot sent him hopping back into the garden roaring with pain and swearing with vexation when he was delivered from this annoyance by the scotchman who had been bred to surgery he looked about him wildly exclaiming sure the fellow wont be such a rogue as to run clear away with my boots our landlord having reconnoitered the shoes he had left which indeed hardly deserved that name pray said he mr birkin want your boots made of calfskin calfskin or cowskin replied the other ill find a slip of sheepskin that will do his businessi lost twenty pounds by his farce which you persuaded me to buyi am out of pocket five pounds by his damnd ode and now this pair of boots bran new cost me thirty shillings as per receiptbut this affair of the boots is felonytransportationill have the dog indicted at the old baileyi will mr s i will be revengd even though i should lose my debt in consequence of his conviction  mr s said nothing at present but accommodated him with a pair of shoes then ordered his servant to rub him down and comfort him with a glass of rumpunch which seemed in a great measure to cool the rage of his indignation after all said our landlord this is no more than a humbug in the way of wit though it deserves a more respectable epithet when considered as an effort of invention tim being i suppose out of credit with the cordwainer fell upon this ingenious expedient to supply the want of shoes knowing that mr birkin who loves humour would himself relish the joke upon a little recollection cropdale literally lives by his wit which he has exercised upon all his friends in their turns he once borrowed my poney for five or six days to go to salisbury and sold him in smithfield at his return this was a joke of such a serious nature that in the first transports of my passion i had some thoughts of prosecuting him for horsestealing and even when my resentment had in some measure subsided as he industriously avoided me i vowed i would take satisfaction on his ribs with the first opportunity one day seeing him at some distance in the street coming towards me i began to prepare my cane for action and walked in the shadow of a porter that he might not perceive me soon enough to make his escape but in the very instant i had lifted up the instrument of correction i found tim cropdale metamorphosed into a miserable blind wretch feeling his way with a long stick from post to post and rolling about two bald unlighted orbs instead of eyes i was exceedingly shocked at having so narrowly escaped the concern and disgrace that would have attended such a misapplication of vengeance but next day tim prevailed upon a friend of mine to come and solicit my forgiveness and offer his note payable in six weeks for the price of the poney this gentleman gave me to understand that the blind man was no other than cropdale who having seen me advancing and guessing my intent had immediately converted himself into the object aforesaidi was so diverted at the ingenuity of the evasion that i agreed to pardon his offence refusing his note however that i might keep a prosecution for felony hanging over his head as a security for his future good behaviourbut timothy would by no means trust himself in my hands till the note was acceptedthen he made his appearance at my door as a blind beggar and imposed in such a manner upon my man who had been his old acquaintance and potcompanion that the fellow threw the door in his face and even threatened to give him the bastinado hearing a noise in the hall i went thither and immediately recollecting the figure i had passed in the street accosted him by his own name to the unspeakable astonishment of the footman  birkin declared he loved a joke as well as another but asked if any of the company could tell where mr cropdale lodged that he might send him a proposal about restitution before the boots should be made away with i would willingly give him a pair of new shoes said he and half a guinea into the bargain for the boots which fitted me like a glove and i shant be able to get the fellows of them till the good weather for riding is over the stuttering wit declared that the only secret which cropdale ever kept was the place of his lodgings but he believed that during the heats of summer he commonly took his repose upon a bulk or indulged himself in fresco with one of the kennelnymphs under the portico of st martins church pox on him cried the bookseller he might as well have taken my whip and spurs in that case he might have been tempted to steal another horse and then he would have rid to the devil of course  after coffee i took my leave of mr s with proper acknowledgments of his civility and was extremely well pleased with the entertainment of the day though not yet satisfied with respect to the nature of this connexion betwixt a man of character in the literary world and a parcel of authorlings who in all probability would never be able to acquire any degree of reputation by their labours on this head i interrogated my conductor dick ivy who answered me to this effectone would imagine s had some view to his own interest in giving countenance and assistance to those people whom he knows to be bad men as well as bad writers but if he has any such view he will find himself disappointed for if he is so vain as to imagine he can make them subservient to his schemes of profit or ambition they are cunning enough to make him their property in the mean time there is not one of the company you have seen today myself excepted who does not owe him particular obligationsone of them he bailed out of a spunginghouse and afterwards paid the debtanother he translated into his family and clothed when he was turned out half naked from jail in consequence of an act for the relief of insolvent debtorsa third who was reduced to a woollen night cap and lived upon sheeps trotters up three pair of stairs backward in butcherrow he took into present pay and free quarters and enabled him to appear as a gentleman without having the fear of sheriffs officers before his eyes those who are in distress he supplies with money when he has it and with his credit when he is out of cash when they want business he either finds employment for them in his own service or recommends them to booksellers to execute some project he has formed for their subsistence they are always welcome to his table which though plain is plentiful and to his good offices as far as they will go and when they see occasion they make use of his name with the most petulant familiarity nay they do not even scruple to arrogate to themselves the merit of some of his performances and have been known to sell their own lucubrations as the produce of his brain the scotchman you saw at dinner once personated him at an alehouse in westsmithfield and in the character of s had his head broke by a cowkeeper for having spoke disrespectfully of the christian religion but he took the law of him in his own person and the assailant was fain to give him ten pounds to withdraw his action  i observed that all this appearance of liberality on the side of mr s was easily accounted for on the supposition that they flattered him in private and engaged his adversaries in public and yet i was astonished when i recollected that i often had seen this writer virulently abused in papers poems and pamphlets and not a pen was drawn in his defence but you will be more astonished said he when i assure you those very guests whom you saw at his table today were the authors of great part of that abuse and he himself is well aware of their particular favours for they are all eager to detect and betray one another but this is doing the devils work for nothing cried i what should induce them to revile their benefactor without provocation envy answered dick is the general incitement but they are galled by an additional scourge of provocation s directs a literary journal in which their productions are necessarily brought to trial and though many of them have been treated with such lenity and favour as they little deserved yet the slightest censure such as perhaps could not be avoided with any pretensions to candour and impartiality has rankled in the hearts of those authors to such a degree that they have taken immediate vengeance on the critic in anonymous libels letters and lampoons indeed all the writers of the age good bad and indifferent from the moment he assumed this office became his enemies either professed or in petto except those of his friends who knew they had nothing to fear from his strictures and he must be a wiser man than me who can tell what advantage or satisfaction he derives from having brought such a nest of hornets about his ears  i owned that was a point which might deserve consideration but still i expressed a desire to know his real motives for continuing his friendship to a set of rascals equally ungrateful and insignificanthe said he did not pretend to assign any reasonable motive that if the truth must be told the man was in point of conduct a most incorrigible fool that though he pretended to have a knack at hitting off characters he blundered strangely in the distribution of his favours which were generally bestowed on the most undeserving of those who had recourse to his assistance that indeed this preference was not so much owing to want of discernment as to want of resolution for he had not fortitude enough to resist the importunity even of the most worthless and as he did not know the value of money there was very little merit in parting with it so easily that his pride was gratified in seeing himself courted by such a number of literary dependents that probably he delighted in hearing them expose and traduce one another and finally from their information he became acquainted with all the transactions of grubstreet which he had some thoughts of compiling for the entertainment of the public  i could not help suspecting from dicks discourse that he had some particular grudge against s upon whose conduct he had put the worst construction it would bear and by dint of crossexamination i found he was not at all satisfied with the character which had been given in the review of his last performance though it had been treated civilly in consequence of the authors application to the critic by all accounts s is not without weakness and caprice but he is certainly goodhumoured and civilized nor do i find that there is any thing overbearing cruel or implacable in his disposition  i have dwelt so long upon authors that you will perhaps suspect i intend to enroll myself among the fraternity but if i were actually qualified for the profession it is at best but a desperate resource against starving as it affords no provision for old age and infirmity salmon at the age of fourscore is now in a garret compiling matter at a guinea a sheet for a modern historian who in point of age might be his grandchild and psalmonazar after having drudged half a century in the literary mill in all the simplicity and abstinence of an asiatic subsists upon the charity of a few booksellers just sufficient to keep him from the parish i think guy who was himself a bookseller ought to have appropriated one wing or ward of his hospital to the use of decayed authors though indeed there is neither hospital college nor workhouse within the bills of mortality large enough to contain the poor of this society composed as it is from the refuse of every other profession  i know not whether you will find any amusement in this account of an odd race of mortals whose constitution had i own greatly interested the curiosity of  yours j melford london june  0     to miss laetitia willis at gloucester  my dear letty  there is something on my spirits which i should not venture to communicate by the post but having the opportunity of mrs brentwoods return i seize it eagerly to disburthen my poor heart which is oppressed with fear and vexationo letty what a miserable situation it is to be without a friend to whom one can apply for counsel and consolation in distress i hinted in my last that one mr barton had been very particular in his civilities i can no longer mistake his meaninghe has formally professed himself my admirer and after a thousand assiduities perceiving i made but a cold return to his addresses he had recourse to the mediation of lady griskin who has acted the part of a very warm advocate in his behalfbut my dear willis her ladyship over acts her partshe not only expatiates on the ample fortune the great connexions and the unblemished character of mr barton but she takes the trouble to catechise me and two days ago peremptorily told me that a girl of my age could not possibly resist so many considerations if her heart was not preengaged  this insinuation threw me into such a flutter that she could not but observe my disorder and presuming upon the discovery insisted upon my making her the confidante of my passion but although i had not such command of myself as to conceal the emotion of my heart i am not such a child as to disclose its secret to a person who would certainly use them to its prejudice i told her it was no wonder if i was out of countenance at her introducing a subject of conversation so unsuitable to my years and inexperience that i believed mr barton was a very worthy gentleman and i was much obliged to him for his good opinion but the affections were involuntary and mine in particular had as yet made no concessions in his favour she shook her head with an air of distrust that made me tremble and observed that if my affections were free they would submit to the decision of prudence especially when enforced by the authority of those who had a right to direct my conduct this remark implied a design to interest my uncle or my aunt perhaps my brother in behalf of mr bartons passion and i am sadly afraid that my aunt is already gained over yesterday in the forenoon he had been walking with us in the park and stopping in our return at a toyshop he presented her with a very fine snuffbox and me with a gold etuis which i resolutely refused till she commanded me to accept it on pain of her displeasure nevertheless being still unsatisfied with respect to the propriety of receiving this toy i signified my doubts to my brother who said he would consult my uncle on the subject and seemed to think mr barton had been rather premature in his presents  what will be the result of this consultation heaven knows but i am afraid it will produce an explanation with mr barton who will no doubt avow his passion and solicit their consent to a connexion which my soul abhors for my dearest letty it is not in my power to love mr barton even if my heart was untouched by any other tenderness not that there is any thing disagreeable about his person but there is a total want of that nameless charm which captivates and controuls the inchanted spirit at least he appears to me to have this defect but if he had all the engaging qualifications which a man can possess they would be excited in vain against that constancy which i flatter myself is the characteristic of my nature no my dear willis i may be involved in fresh troubles and i believe i shall from the importunities of this gentleman and the violence of my relations but my heart is incapable of change  you know i put no faith in dreams and yet i have been much disturbed by one that visited me last nighti thought i was in a church where a certain person whom you know was on the point of being married to my aunt that the clergyman was mr barton and that poor forlorn i stood weeping in a corner half naked and without shoes or stockingsnow i know there is nothing so childish as to be moved by those vain illusions but nevertheless in spite of all my reason this hath made a strong impression upon my mind which begins to be very gloomy indeed i have another more substantial cause of afflictioni have some religious scruples my dear friend which lie heavy on my consciencei was persuaded to go to the tabernacle where i heard a discourse that affected me deeplyi have prayed fervently to be enlightened but as yet i am not sensible of these inward motions those operations of grace which are the signs of a regenerated spirit and therefore i begin to be in terrible apprehensions about the state of my poor soul some of our family have had very uncommon accessions particularly my aunt and mrs jenkins who sometimes speak as if they were really inspired so that i am not like to want for either exhortation or example to purify my thoughts and recall them from the vanities of this world which indeed i would willingly resign if it was in my power but to make this sacrifice i must be enabled by such assistance from above as hath not yet been indulged to  your unfortunate friend lydia melford june  0     to sir watkin phillips of jesus college oxon  dear phillips  the moment i received your letter i began to execute your commissionwith the assistance of mine host at the bull and gate i discovered the place to which your fugitive valet had retreated and taxed him with his dishonestythe fellow was in manifest confusion at sight of me but he denied the charge with great confidence till i told him that if he would give up the watch which was a family piece he might keep the money and the clothes and go to the devil his own way at his leisure but if he rejected this proposal i would deliver him forthwith to the constable whom i had provided for that purpose and he would carry him before the justice without further delay after some hesitation he desired to speak with me in the next room where he produced the watch with all its appendages and i have delivered it to our landlord to be sent you by the first safe conveyance  so much for business  i shall grow vain upon your saying you find entertainment in my letters barren as they certainly are of incident and importance because your amusement must arise not from the matter but from the manner which you know is all my ownanimated therefore by the approbation of a person whose nice taste and consummate judgment i can no longer doubt i will chearfully proceed with our memoirsas it is determined we shall set out next week for yorkshire i went today in the forenoon with my uncle to see a carriage belonging to a coachmaker in our neighbourhoodturning down a narrow lane behind longacre we perceived a crowd of people standing at a door which it seems opened into a kind of a methodist meeting and were informed that a footman was then holding forth to the congregation within curious to see this phoenomenon we squeezed into the place with much difficulty and who should this preacher be but the identical humphry clinker he had finished his sermon and given out a psalm the first stave of which he sung with peculiar gracesbut if we were astonished to see clinker in the pulpit we were altogether confounded at finding all the females of our family among the audiencethere was lady griskin mrs tabitha bramble mrs winifred jenkins my sister liddy and mr barton and all of them joined in the psalmody with strong marks of devotion  i could hardly keep my gravity on this ludicrous occasion but old squaretoes was differently affectedthe first thing that struck him was the presumption of his lacquey whom he commanded to come down with such an air of authority as humphry did not think proper to disregard he descended immediately and all the people were in commotion barton looked exceedingly sheepish lady griskin flirted her fan mrs tabby groaned in spirit liddy changed countenance and mrs jenkins sobbed as if her heart was breakingmy uncle with a sneer asked pardon of the ladies for having interrupted their devotion saying he had particular business with the preacher whom he ordered to call a hackneycoach this being immediately brought up to the end of the lane he handed liddy into it and my aunt and i following him we drove home without taking any further notice of the rest of the company who still remained in silent astonishment  mr bramble perceiving liddy in great trepidation assumed a milder aspect bidding her be under no concern for he was not at all displeased at any thing she had donei have no objection said he to your being religiously inclined but i dont think my servant is a proper ghostly director for a devotee of your sex and characterif in fact as i rather believe your aunt is not the sole conductress of this machinemrs tabitha made no answer but threw up the whites of her eyes as if in the act of ejaculationpoor liddy said she had no right to the title of a devotee that she thought there was no harm in hearing a pious discourse even if it came from a footman especially as her aunt was present but that if she had erred from ignorance she hoped he would excuse it as she could not bear the thoughts of living under his displeasure the old gentleman pressing her hand with a tender smile said she was a good girl and that he did not believe her capable of doing any thing that could give him the least umbrage or disgust  when we arrived at our lodgings he commanded mr clinker to attend him up stairs and spoke to him in these wordssince you are called upon by the spirit to preach and to teach it is high time to lay aside the livery of an earthly master and for my part i am unworthy to have an apostle in my servicei hope said humphry i have not failed in my duty to your honouri should be a vile wretch if i did considering the misery from which your charity and compassion relieved mebut having an inward admonition of the spirit an admonition of the devil cried the squire in a passion what admonition you blockhead what right has such a fellow as you to set up for a reformer begging your honours pardon replied clinker may not the new light of gods grace shine upon the poor and the ignorant in their humility as well as upon the wealthy and the philosopher in all his pride of human learning what you imagine to be the new light of grace said his master i take to be a deceitful vapour glimmering through a crack in your upper storyin a word mr clinker i will have no light in my family but what pays the kings taxes unless it be the light of reason which you dont pretend to follow  ah sir cried humphry the light of reason is no more in comparison to the light i mean than a farthing candle to the sun at noonvery true said uncle the one will serve to shew you your way and the other to dazzle and confound your weak brain heark ye clinker you are either an hypocritical knave or a wrongheaded enthusiast and in either case unfit for my service if you are a quack in sanctity and devotion you will find it an easy matter to impose upon silly women and others of crazed understanding who will contribute lavishly for your support if you are really seduced by the reveries of a disturbed imagination the sooner you lose your senses entirely the better for yourself and the community in that case some charitable person might provide you with a dark room and clean straw in bedlam where it would not be in your power to infect others with your fanaticism whereas if you have just reflection enough left to maintain the character of a chosen vessel in the meetings of the godly you and your hearers will be misled by a willithewisp from one error into another till you are plunged into religious frenzy and then perhaps you will hang yourself in despair which the lord of his infinite mercy forbid exclaimed the affrighted clinker it is very possible i may be under the temptation of the devil who wants to wreck me on the rocks of spiritual prideyour honour says i am either a knave or a madman now as ill assure your honour i am no knave it follows that i must be mad therefore i beseech your honour upon my knees to take my case into consideration that means may be used for my recovery  the squire could not help smiling at the poor fellows simplicity and promised to take care of him provided he would mind the business of his place without running after the new light of methodism but mrs tabitha took offence at his humility which she interpreted into poorness of spirit and worldly mindedness she upbraided him with the want of courage to suffer for conscience sakeshe observed that if he should lose his place for bearing testimony to the truth providence would not fail to find him another perhaps more advantageous and declaring that it could not be very agreeable to live in a family where an inquisition was established retired to another room in great agitation  my uncle followed her with a significant look then turning to the preacher you hear what my sister saysif you cannot live with me upon such terms as i have prescribed the vineyard of methodism lies before you and she seems very well disposed to reward your labouri would not willingly give offence to any soul upon earth answered humphry her ladyship has been very good to me ever since we came to london and surely she has a heart turned for religious exercises and both she and lady griskin sing psalms and hymns like two cherubimsbut at the same time im bound to love and obey your honourit becometh not such a poor ignorant fellow as me to hold dispute with gentlemen of rank and learningas for the matter of knowledge i am no more than a beast in comparison of your honour therefore i submit and with gods grace i will follow you to the worlds end if you dont think me too far gone to be out of confinement  his master promised to keep him for some time longer on trial then desired to know in what manner lady griskin and mr barton came to join their religious society he told him that her ladyship was the person who first carried my aunt and sister to the tabernacle whither he attended them and had his devotion kindled by mr ws preaching that he was confirmed in this new way by the preachers sermons which he had bought and studied with great attention that his discourse and prayers had brought over mrs jenkins and the housemaid to the same way of thinking but as for mr barton he had never seen him at service before this day when he came in company with lady griskin humphry moreover owned that he had been encouraged to mount the rostrum by the example and success of a weaver who was much followed as a powerful minister that on his first trial he found himself under such strong impulsions as made him believe he was certainly moved by the spirit and that he had assisted in lady griskins and several private houses at exercises of devotion  mr bramble was no sooner informed that her ladyship had acted as the primum mobile of this confederacy than he concluded she had only made use of clinker as a tool subservient to the execution of some design to the true secret of which he was an utter strangerhe observed that her ladyships brain was a perfect mill for projects and that she and tabby had certainly engaged in some secret treaty the nature of which he could not comprehend i told him i thought it was no difficult matter to perceive the drift of mrs tabitha which was to ensnare the heart of barton and that in all likelihood my lady griskin acted as her auxiliary that this supposition would account for their endeavours to convert him to methodism an event which would occasion a connexion of souls that might be easily improved into a matrimonial union  my uncle seemed to be much diverted by the thoughts of this schemes succeeding but i gave him to understand that barton was preengaged that he had the day before made a present of an etuis to liddy which her aunt had obliged her to receive with a view no doubt to countenance her own accepting of a snuffbox at the same time that my sister having made me acquainted with this incident i had desired an explanation of mr barton who declared his intentions were honourable and expressed his hope that i would have no objections to his alliance that i had thanked him for the honour he intended our family but told him it would be necessary to consult her uncle and aunt who were her guardians and their approbation being obtained i could have no objection to his proposal though i was persuaded that no violence would be offered to my sisters inclinations in a transaction that so nearly interested the happiness of her future life that he had assured me he should never think of availing himself of a guardians authority unless he could render his addresses agreeable to the young lady herself and that he would immediately demand permission of mr and mrs bramble to make liddy a tender of his hand and fortune  the squire was not insensible to the advantages of such a match and declared he would promote it with all his influence but when i took notice that there seemed to be an aversion on the side of liddy he said he would sound her on the subject and if her reluctance was such as would not be easily overcome he would civilly decline the proposal of mr barton for he thought that in the choice of a husband a young woman ought not to sacrifice the feelings of her heart for any consideration upon earthliddy is not so desperate said he as to worship fortune at such an expence  i take it for granted this whole affair will end in smoke though there seems to be a storm brewing in the quarter of mrs tabby who sat with all the sullen dignity of silence at dinner seemingly pregnant with complaint and expostulation as she had certainly marked barton for her own prey she cannot possibly favour his suit to liddy and therefore i expect something extraordinary will attend his declaring himself my sisters admirer this declaration will certainly be made in form as soon as the lover can pick up resolution enough to stand the brunt of mrs tabbys disappointment for he is without doubt aware of her designs upon his personthe particulars of the denouement you shall know in due season mean while i am  always yours j melford london june  0     to dr lewis  dear lewis  the deceitful calm was of short duration i am plunged again in a sea of vexation and the complaints in my stomach and bowels are returned so that i suppose i shall be disabled from prosecuting the excursion i had plannedwhat the devil had i to do to come a plague hunting with a leash of females in my train yesterday my precious sister who by the bye has been for some time a professed methodist came into my apartment attended by mr barton and desired an audience with a very stately airbrother said she this gentleman has something to propose which i flatter myself will be the more acceptable as it will rid you of a troublesome companion then mr barton proceeded to this effecti am indeed extremely ambitious of being allied to your family mr bramble and i hope you will see no cause to interpose your authority as for authority said tabby interrupting him with some warmth i know of none that he has a right to use on this occasionif i pay him the compliment of making him acquainted with the step i intend to take it is all he can expect in reasonthis is as much as i believe he would do by me if he intended to change his own situation in lifein a word brother i am so sensible of mr bartons extra ordinary merit that i have been prevailed upon to alter my resolution of living a single life and to put my happiness in his hands by vesting him with a legal title to my person and fortune such as they are the business at present is to have the writings drawn and i shall be obliged to you if you will recommend a lawyer to me for that purpose  you may guess what an effect this overture had upon me who from the information of my nephew expected that barton was to make a formal declaration of his passion for liddy i could not help gazing in silent astonishment alternately at tabby and her supposed admirer who last hung his head in the most aukward confusion for a few minutes and then retired on pretence of being suddenly seized with a vertigomrs tabitha affected much concern and would have had him make use of a bed in the house but he insisted upon going home that he might have recourse of some drops which he kept for such emergencies and his innamorata acquiescedin the mean time i was exceedingly puzzled at this adventure though i suspected the truth and did not know in what manner to demean myself towards mrs tabitha when jery came in and told me he had just seen mr barton alight from his chariot at lady griskins doorthis incident seemed to threaten a visit from her ladyship with which we were honoured accordingly in less than half an houri find said she there has been a match of cross purposes among you good folks and im come to set you to rightsso saying she presented me with the following billet  dear sir  i no sooner recollected myself from the extreme confusion i was thrown into by that unlucky mistake of your sister than i thought it my duty to assure you that my devoirs to mrs bramble never exceeded the bounds of ordinary civility and that my heart is unalterably fixed upon miss liddy melford as i had the honour to declare to her brother when he questioned me upon that subjectlady griskin has been so good as to charge herself not only with the delivery of this note but also with the task of undeceiving mrs bramble for whom i have the most profound respect and veneration though my affection being otherwise engaged is no longer in the power of  sir your very humble servant ralph barton  having cast my eyes over this billet i told her ladyship that i would no longer retard the friendly office she had undertaken and i and jery forthwith retired into another room there we soon perceived the conversation grow very warm betwixt the two ladies and at length could distinctly hear certain terms of altercation which we could no longer delay interrupting with any regard to decorum when we entered the scene of contention we found liddy had joined the disputants and stood trembling betwixt them as if she had been afraid they would have proceeded to something more practical than words lady griskins face was like the full moon in a storm of wind glaring fiery and portentous while tabby looked grim and ghastly with an aspect breathing discord and dismayour appearance put a stop to their mutual revilings but her ladyship turning to me cousin said she i cant help saying i have met with a very ungrateful return from this lady for the pains i have taken to serve her familymy family is much obliged to your ladyship cried tabby with a kind of hysterical giggle but we have no right to the good offices of such an honourable gobetween but for all that good mrs tabitha bramble resumed the other i shall be content with the reflection that virtue is its own reward and it shall not be my fault if you continue to make yourself ridiculousmr bramble who has no little interest of his own to serve will no doubt contribute all in his power to promote a match betwixt mr barton and his niece which will be equally honourable and advantageous and i dare say miss liddy herself will have no objection to a measure so well calculated to make her happy in lifei beg your ladyships pardon exclaimed liddy with great vivacity i have nothing but misery to expect from such a measure and i hope my guardians will have too much compassion to barter my peace of mind for any consideration of interest or fortuneupon my word miss liddy said she you have profited by the example of your good aunti comprehend your meaning and will explain it when i have a proper opportunityin the mean time i shall take my leavemadam your most obedient and devoted humble servant said she advancing close up to my sister and curtsying so low that i thought she intended to squat herself down on the floorthis salutation tabby returned with equal solemnity and the expression of the two faces while they continued in this attitude would be no bad subject for a pencil like that of the incomparable hogarth if any such should ever appear again in these times of dullness and degeneracy  jery accompanied her ladyship to her house that he might have an opportunity to restore the etuis to barton and advise him to give up his suit which was so disagreeable to his sister against whom however he returned much irritatedlady griskin had assured him that liddys heart was preoccupied and immediately the idea of wilson recurring to his imagination his familypride took the alarm he denounced vengeance against the adventurer and was disposed to be very peremptory with his sister but i desired he would suppress his resentment until i should have talked with her in private  the poor girl when i earnestly pressed her on this head owned with a flood of tears that wilson had actually come to the hot well at bristol and even introduced himself into our lodgings as a jew pedlar but that nothing had passed betwixt them further than her begging him to withdraw immediately if he had any regard for her peace of mind that he had disappeared accordingly after having attempted to prevail upon my sisters maid to deliver a letter which however she refused to receive though she had consented to carry a message importing that he was a gentleman of a good family and that in a very little time he would avow his passion in that charactershe confessed that although he had not kept his word in this particular he was not yet altogether indifferent to her affection but solemnly promised she would never carry on any correspondence with him or any other admirer for the future without the privity and approbation of her brother and me  by this declaration she made her own peace with jery but the hotheaded boy is more than ever incensed against wilson whom he now considers as an impostor that harbours some infamous design upon the honour of his familyas for barton he was not a little mortified to find his present returned and his addresses so unfavourably received but he is not a man to be deeply affected by such disappointments and i know not whether he is not as well pleased with being discarded by liddy as he would have been with a permission to prosecute his pretensions at the risque of being every day exposed to the revenge or machinations of tabby who is not to be slighted with impunityi had not much time to moralize on these occurrences for the house was visited by a constable and his gang with a warrant from justice buzzard to search the box of humphry clinker my footmanwho was just apprehended as a highwayman this incident threw the whole family into confusion my sister scolded the constable for presuming to enter the lodgings of a gentleman on such an errand without having first asked and obtained permission her maid was frightened into fits and liddy shed tears of compassion for the unfortunate clinker in whose box however nothing was found to confirm the suspicion of robbery  for my own part i made no doubt of the fellows being mistaken for some other person and i went directly to the justice in order to procure his discharge but there i found the matter much more serious than i expectedpoor clinker stood trembling at the bar surrounded by thieftakers and at a little distance a thick squat fellow a postilion his accuser who had seized him on the street and swore positively to his person that the said clinker had on the   th day of march last on blackheath robbed a gentleman in a postchaise which he the postilion drovethis deposition was sufficient to justify his commitment and he was sent accordingly to clerkenwell prison whither jery accompanied him in the coach in order to recommend him properly to the keeper that he may want for no convenience which the place affords  the spectators who assembled to see this highwayman were sagacious enough to discern something very villainous in his aspect which begging their pardon is the very picture of simplicity and the justice himself put a very unfavourable construction upon some of his answers which he said savoured of the ambiguity and equivocation of an old offender but in my opinion it would have been more just and humane to impute them to the confusion into which we may suppose a poor country lad to be thrown on such an occasion i am still persuaded he is innocent and in this persuasion i can do no less than use my utmost endeavours that he may not be oppressedi shall tomorrow send my nephew to wait on the gentleman who was robbed and beg he will have the humanity to go and see the prisoner that in case he should find him quite different from the person of the highwayman he may bear testimony in his behalfhowsoever it may fare with clinker this cursed affair will be to me productive of intolerable chagrini have already caught a dreadful cold by rushing into the open air from the justices parlour where i had been stewing in the crowd and though i should not be laid up with the gout as i believe i shall i must stay at london for some weeks till this poor devil comes to his trial at rochester so that in all probability my northern expedition is blown up  if you can find any thing in your philosophical budget to console me in the midst of these distresses and apprehensions pray let it be communicated to  your unfortunate friend matt bramble london june        to sir watkin phillips of jesus college oxon  dear wat  the farce is finished and another piece of a graver cast brought upon the stageour aunt made a desperate attack upon barton who had no other way of saving himself but by leaving her in possession of the field and avowing his pretensions to liddy by whom he has been rejected in his turnlady griskin acted as his advocate and agent on this occasion with such zeal as embroiled her with mrs tabitha and a high scene of altercation passed betwixt these two religionists which might have come to action had not my uncle interposed they are however reconciled in consequence of an event which hath involved us all in trouble and disquiet you must know the poor preacher humphry clinker is now exercising his ministry among the felons in clerkenwell prisona postilion having sworn a robbery against him no bail could be taken and he was committed to jail notwithstanding all the remonstrances and interest my uncle could make in his behalf  all things considered the poor fellow cannot possibly be guilty and yet i believe he runs some risque of being hanged upon his examination he answered with such hesitation and reserve as persuaded most of the people who crowded the place that he was really a knave and the justices remarks confirmed their opinion exclusive of my uncle and myself there was only one person who seemed inclined to favour the culprithe was a young man well dressed and from the manner in which he crossexamined the evidence we took it for granted that he was a student in one of the inns of courthe freely checked the justice for some uncharitable inferences he made to the prejudice of the prisoner and even ventured to dispute with his worship on certain points of law  my uncle provoked at the unconnected and dubious answers of clinker who seemed in danger of falling a sacrifice to his own simplicity exclaimed in the name of god if you are innocent say so no cried he god forbid that i should call myself innocent while my conscience is burthened with sin what then you did commit this robbery resumed his master no sure said he blessed be the lord im free of that guilt  here the justice interposed observing that the man seemed inclined to make a discovery by turning kings evidence and desired the clerk to take his confession upon which humphry declared that he looked upon confession to be a popish fraud invented by the whore of babylon the templar affirmed that the poor fellow was non compos and exhorted the justice to discharge him as a lunaticyou know very well added he that the robbery in question was not committed by the prisoner  the thieftakers grinned at one another and mr justice buzzard replied with great emotion mr martin i desire you will mind your own business i shall convince you one of these days that i understand mine in short there was no remedy the mittimus was made out and poor clinker sent to prison in a hackneycoach guarded by the constable and accompanied by your humble servant by the way i was not a little surprised to hear this retainer to justice bid the prisoner to keep up his spirits for that he did not at all doubt but that he would get off for a few weeks confinementhe said his worship knew very well that clinker was innocent of the fact and that the real highwayman who robbed the chaise was no other than that very individual mr martin who had pleaded so strenuously for honest humphry  confounded at this information i asked why then is he suffered to go about at his liberty and this poor innocent fellow treated as a malefactor we have exact intelligence of all mr martins transactions said he but as yet there is not evidence sufficient for his conviction and as for this young man the justice could do no less than commit him as the postilion swore pointblank to his identity so if this rascally postilion should persist in the falsity to which he is sworn said i this innocent lad may be brought to the gallows  the constable observed that he would have time enough to prepare for his trial and might prove an alibi or perhaps martin might be apprehended and convicted for another fact in which case he might be prevailed upon to take this affair upon himself or finally if these chances should fail and the evidence stand good against clinker the jury might recommend him to mercy in consideration of his youth especially if this should appear to be the first fact of which he had been guilty  humphry owned he could not pretend to recollect where he had been on the day when the robbery was committed much less prove a circumstance of that kind so far back as six months though he knew he had been sick of the fever and ague which however did not prevent him from going aboutthen turning up his eyes he ejaculated the lords will be done if it be my fate to suffer i hope i shall not disgrace the faith of which though unworthy i make profession  when i expressed my surprize that the accuser should persist in charging clinker without taking the least notice of the real robber who stood before him and to whom indeed humphry bore not the smallest resemblance the constable who was himself a thieftaker gave me to understand that mr martin was the best qualified for business of all the gentlemen on the road he had ever known that he had always acted on his own bottom without partner or correspondent and never went to work but when he was cool and sober that his courage and presence of mind never failed him that his address was genteel and his behaviour void of all cruelty and insolence that he never encumbered himself with watches or trinkets nor even with banknotes but always dealt for ready money and that in the current coin of the kingdom and that he could disguise himself and his horse in such a manner that after the action it was impossible to recognize either the one or the otherthis great man said he has reigned paramount in all the roads within fifty miles of london above fifteen months and has done more business in that time than all the rest of the profession put together for those who pass through his hands are so delicately dealt with that they have no desire to give him the least disturbance but for all that his race is almost runhe is now fluttering about justice like a moth about a candlethere are so many limetwigs laid in his way that ill bet a cool hundred he swings before christmas  shall i own to you that this portrait drawn by a ruffian heightened by what i myself had observed in his deportment has interested me warmly in the fate of poor martin whom nature seems to have intended for a useful and honourable member of that community upon which he now preys for subsistence it seems he lived some time as a clerk to a timbermerchant whose daughter martin having privately married was discarded and his wife turned out of doors she did not long survive her marriage and martin turning fortunehunter could not supply his occasions any other way than by taking to the road in which he has travelled hitherto with uncommon successhe pays his respects regularly to mr justice buzzard the thiefcatchergeneral of this metropolis and sometimes they smoke a pipe together very lovingly when the conversation generally turns upon the nature of evidencethe justice has given him fair warning to take care of himself and he has received his caution in good parthitherto he has baffled all the vigilance art and activity of buzzard and his emissaries with such conduct as would have done honour to the genius of a caesar or a turenne but he has one weakness which has proved fatal to all the heroes of his tribe namely an indiscreet devotion to the fair sex and in all probability he will be attacked on this defenceless quarter  be that as it may i saw the body of poor clinker consigned to the gaoler of clerkenwell to whose indulgence i recommended him so effectually that he received him in the most hospitable manner though there was a necessity for equipping him with a suit of irons in which he made a very rueful appearance the poor creature seemed as much affected by my uncles kindness as by his own misfortune when i assured him that nothing should be left undone for procuring his enlargement and making his confinement easy in the mean time he fell down on his knees and kissing my hand which he bathed with his tears 0 squire cried he sobbing what shall i sayi cantno i cant speakmy poor heart is bursting with gratitude to you and my deardear generousnoble benefactor  i protest the scene became so pathetic that i was fain to force myself away and returned to my uncle who sent me in the afternoon with a compliment to one mr mead the person who had been robbed on blackheath as i did not find him at home i left a message in consequence of which he called at our lodgings this morning and very humanely agreed to visit the prisoner by this time lady griskin had come to make her formal compliments of condolance to mrs tabitha on this domestic calamity and that prudent maiden whose passion was now cooled thought proper to receive her ladyship so civilly that a reconciliation immediately ensued these two ladies resolved to comfort the poor prisoner in their own persons and mr mead and i squired them to clerkenwell my uncle being detained at home by some slight complaints in his stomach and bowels  the turnkey who received us at clerkenwell looked remarkably sullen and when we enquired for clinker i dont care if the devil had him said he here has been nothing but canting and praying since the fellow entered the placerabbit him the tap will be ruinedwe hant sold a cask of beer nor a dozen of wine since he paid his garnishthe gentlemen get drunk with nothing but your damned religionfor my part i believe as how your man deals with the deviltwo or three as bold hearts as ever took the air upon hounslow have been blubbering all night and if the fellow ant speedily removed by habeas corpus or otherwise ill be damnd if theres a grain of true spirit left within these walls we shant have a soul to do credit to the place or make his exit like a true born englishmandamn my eyes there will be nothing but snivelling in the cartwe shall all die like so many psalmsinging weavers  in short we found that humphry was at that very instant haranguing the felons in the chapel and that the gaolers wife and daughter together with my aunts woman win jenkins and our housemaid were among the audience which we immediately joined i never saw any thing so strongly picturesque as this congregation of felons clanking their chains in the midst of whom stood orator clinker expatiating in a transport of fervor on the torments of hell denounced in scripture against evildoers comprehending murderers robbers thieves and whore mongers the variety of attention exhibited in the faces of those ragamuffins formed a groupe that would not have disgraced the pencil of a raphael in one it denoted admiration in another doubt in a third disdain in a fourth contempt in a fifth terror in a sixth derision and in a seventh indignationas for mrs winifred jenkins she was in tears overwhelmed with sorrow but whether for her own sins or the misfortune of clinker i cannot pretend to say the other females seemed to listen with a mixture of wonder and devotion the gaolers wife declared he was a saint in trouble saying she wished from her heart there was such another good soul like him in every gaol in england  mr mead having earnestly surveyed the preacher declared his appearance was so different from that of the person who robbed him on blackheath that he could freely make oath he was not the man but humphry himself was by this time pretty well rid of all apprehensions of being hanged for he had been the night before solemnly tried and acquitted by his fellow prisoners some of whom he had already converted to methodism he now made proper acknowledgments for the honour of our visit and was permitted to kiss the hands of the ladies who assured him he might depend upon their friendship and protection lady griskin in her great zeal exhorted his fellowprisoners to profit by the precious opportunity of having such a saint in bonds among them and turn over a new leaf for the benefit of their poor souls and that her admonition might have the greater effect she reinforced it with her bounty  while she and mrs tabby returned in the coach with the two maidservants i waited on mr mead to the house of justice buzzard who having heard his declaration said his oath could be of no use at present but that he would be a material evidence for the prisoner at his trial so that there seems to be no remedy but patience for poor clinker and indeed the same virtue or medicine will be necessary for us all the squire in particular who had set his heart upon his excursion to the northward  while we were visiting honest humphry in clerkenwell prison my uncle received a much more extraordinary visit at his own lodgings mr martin of whom i have made such honourable mention desired permission to pay him his respects and was admitted accordingly he told him that having observed him at mr buzzards a good deal disturbed by what had happened to his servant he had come to assure him he had nothing to apprehend for clinkers life for if it was possible that any jury could find him guilty upon such evidence he martin himself would produce in court a person whose deposition would bring him off clear as the sun at noonsure the fellow would not be so romantic as to take the robbery upon himselfhe said the postilion was an infamous fellow who had been a dabbler in the same profession and saved his life at the old bailey by impeaching his companions that being now reduced to great poverty he had made this desperate push to swear away the life of an innocent man in hopes of having the reward upon his conviction but that he would find himself miserably disappointed for the justice and his myrmidons were determined to admit of no interloper in this branch of business and that he did not at all doubt but that they would find matter enough to shop the evidence himself before the next gaoldelivery he affirmed that all these circumstances were well known to the justice and that his severity to clinker was no other than a hint to his master to make him a present in private as an acknowledgment of his candour and humanity  this hint however was so unpalatable to mr bramble that he declared with great warmth he would rather confine himself for life to london which he detested than be at liberty to leave it tomorrow in consequence of encouraging corruption in a magistrate hearing however how favourable mr meads report had been for the prisoner he is resolved to take the advice of counsel in what manner to proceed for his immediate enlargement i make no doubt but that in a day or two this troublesome business may be discussed and in this hope we are preparing for our journey if our endeavours do not miscarry we shall have taken the field before you hear again from  yours j melford london june        to dr lewis  thank heaven dear lewis the clouds are dispersed and i have now the clearest prospect of my summer campaign which i hope i shall be able to begin tomorrow i took the advice of counsel with respect to the case of clinker in whose favour a lucky incident has intervened the fellow who accused him has had his own battery turned upon himselftwo days ago he was apprehended for a robbery on the highway and committed on the evidence of an accomplice clinker having moved for a writ of habeas corpus was brought before the lord chief justice who in consequence of an affidavit of the gentleman who had been robbed importing that the said clinker was not the person who stopped him on the highway as well as in consideration of the postilions character and present circumstances was pleased to order that my servant should be admitted to bail and he has been discharged accordingly to the unspeakable satisfaction of our whole family to which he has recommended himself in an extraordinary manner not only by his obliging deportment but by his talents of preaching praying and singing psalms which he has exercised with such effect that even tabby respects him as a chosen vessel if there was any thing like affectation or hypocrisy in this excess of religion i would not keep him in my service but so far as i can observe the fellows character is downright simplicity warmed with a kind of enthusiasm which renders him very susceptible of gratitude and attachment to his benefactors  as he is an excellent horseman and understands farriery i have bought a stout gelding for his use that he may attend us on the road and have an eye to our cattle in case the coachman should not mind his business my nephew who is to ride his own saddlehorse has taken upon trial a servant just come from abroad with his former master sir william strollop who vouches for his honesty the fellow whose name is dutton seems to be a petit maitrehe has got a smattering of french bows and grins and shrugs and takes snuff a la mode de france but values himself chiefly upon his skill and dexterity in hairdressingif i am not much deceived by appearance he is in all respects the very contrast of humphry clinker  my sister has made up matters with lady griskin though i must own i should not have been sorry to see that connexion entirely destroyed but tabby is not of a disposition to forgive barton who i understand is gone to his seat in berkshire for the summer season i cannot help suspecting that in the treaty of peace which has been lately ratified betwixt those two females it is stipulated that her ladyship shall use her best endeavours to provide an agreeable helpmate for our sister tabitha who seems to be quite desperate in her matrimonial designs perhaps the matchmaker is to have a valuable consideration in the way of brokerage which she will most certainly deserve if she can find any man in his senses who will yoke with mrs bramble from motives of affection or interest  i find my spirits and my health affect each other reciprocally that is to say every thing that discomposes my mind produces a correspondent disorder in my body and my bodily complaints are remarkably mitigated by those considerations that dissipate the clouds of mental chagrinthe imprisonment of clinker brought on those symptoms which i mentioned in my last and now they are vanished at his dischargeit must be owned indeed i took some of the tincture of ginseng prepared according to your prescription and found it exceedingly grateful to the stomach but the pain and sickness continued to return after short intervals till the anxiety of my mind was entirely removed and then i found myself perfectly at case we have had fair weather these ten days to the astonishment of the londoners who think it portentous if you enjoy the same indulgence in wales i hope barns has got my hay made and safe cocked by this time as we shall be in motion for some weeks i cannot expect to hear from you as usual but i shall continue to write from every place at which we make any halt that you may know our track in case it should be necessary to communicate any thing to  your assured friend matt bramble london june        to mrs mary jones at brambletonhall c  dear mary  having the occasion of my cousin jenkins of abergany i send you as a token a turkeyshell comb a kiple of yards of green ribbon and a sarment upon the nothingness of good works which was preached in the tabernacle and you will also receive a hornbuck for saul whereby she may learn her letters for fin much consarned about the state of her poor soleand what are all the pursuits of this life to the consarns of that immortal partwhat is life but a veil of affliction o mary the whole family have been in such a constipationmr clinker has been in trouble but the gates of hell have not been able to prevail again him his virtue is like poor gould seven times tried in the fire he was tuck up for a rubbery and had before gustass busshard who made his mittamouse and the pore youth was sent to prison upon the false oaf of a willian that wanted to sware his life away for the looker of cain  the squire did all in his power but could not prevent his being put in chains and confined among common manufactors where he stood like an innocent sheep in the midst of wolves and tygerslord knows what mought have happened to this pyehouse young man if master had not applied to apias korkus who lives with the ould bailiff and is they say five hundred years old god bless us and a congeror but if he be sure i am he dont deal with the devil otherwise he couldnt have fought out mr clinker as he did in spite of stone walls iron bolts and double locks that flew open at his command for ould scratch has not a greater enemy upon hearth than mr clinker who is indeed a very powerful labourer in the lords vineyard i do no more than yuse the words of my good lady who has got the infectual calling and i trust that even myself though unworthy shall find grease to be exceptedmiss liddy has been touchd to the quick but is a little timorsome howsomever i make no doubt but she and all of us will be brought by the endeavours of mr clinker to produce blessed fruit of generation and repentanceas for master and the young squire they have as yet had narro glimpse of the new lighti doubt as how their harts are hardened by worldly wisdom which as the pyebill saith is foolishness in the sight of god  o mary jones pray without seizing for grease to prepare you for the operations of this wonderful instrument which i hope will be exorcised this winter upon you and others at brambletonhall tomorrow we are to set out in a cox and four for yorkshire and i believe we shall travel that way far and far and farther than i can tell but i shant go so far as to forget my friends and mary jones will always be remembered as one of them by her   humble sarvant win jenkins london june        to mrs gwyllim housekeeper at brambletonhall mrs gwyllim  i cant help thinking it very strange that i never had an answer to the letter i wrote you some weeks ago from bath concerning the sour bear the gander and the maids eating butter which i wont allow to be wastedwe are now going upon a long journey to the north whereby i desire you will redouble your care and circumflexion that the family may be well managed in our absence for you know you must render account not only to your earthly master but also to him that is above and if you are found a good and faithful sarvant great will be your reward in haven i hope there will be twenty stun of cheese ready for marketby the time i get huom and as much owl spun as will make half a dozen pair of blankets and that the savings of the buttermilk will fetch me a good penny before martinmass as the two pigs are to be fed for baking with bitchmast and acrons  i wrote to doctor lews for the same porpuss but he never had the good manners to take the least notice of my letter for which reason i shall never favour him with another though he beshits me on his bended knees you will do well to keep a watchful eye over the hind villiams who is one of his amissories and i believe no better than he should be at bottom god forbid that i should lack christian charity but charity begins at huom and sure nothing can be a more charitable work than to rid the family of such vermine i do suppose that the bindled cow has been had to the parsons bull that old moll has had another litter of pigs and that dick is become a mighty mouser pray order every thing for the best and be frugal and keep the maids to their labourif i had a private opportunity i would send them some hymns to sing instead of profane ballads but as i cant they and you must be contented with the prayers of   your assured friend t bramble london june        to sir watkin phillips bart of jesus college oxon  dear phillips  the very day after i wrote my last clinker was set at liberty as martin had foretold the accuser was himself committed for a robbery upon unquestionable evidence he had been for some time in the snares of the thieftaking society who resenting his presumption in attempting to incroach upon their monopoly of impeachment had him taken up and committed to newgate on the deposition of an accomplice who has been admitted as evidence for the king the postilion being upon record as an old offender the chief justice made no scruple of admitting clinker to bail when he perused the affidavit of mr mead importing that the said clinker was not the person that robbed him on blackheath and honest humphry was discharged when he came home he expressed great eagerness to pay his respects to his master and here his elocution failed him but his silence was pathetic he fell down at his feet and embraced his knees shedding a flood of tears which my uncle did not see without emotion he took snuff in some confusion and putting his hand in his pocket gave him his blessing in something more substantial than wordsclinker said he i am so well convinced both of your honesty and courage that i am resolved to make you my lifeguardman on the highway  he was accordingly provided with a case of pistols and a carbine to be flung across his shoulders and every other preparation being made we set out last thursday at seven in the morning my uncle with the three women in the coach humphry well mounted on a black gelding bought for his use myself ahorseback attended by my new valet mr dutton an exceeding coxcomb fresh from his travels whom i have taken upon trialthe fellow wears a solitaire uses paint and takes rappee with all the grimace of a french marquis at present however he is in a ridingdress jackboots leather breeches a scarlet waistcoat with gold binding a laced hat a hanger a french postingwhip in his hand and his hair en queue  before we had gone nine miles my horse lost one of his shoes so that i was obliged to stop at barnet to have another while the coach proceeded at an easy pace over the common about a mile short of hatfield the postilions stopping the carriage gave notice to clinker that there were two suspicious fellows ahorseback at the end of a lane who semed waiting to attack the coach humphry forthwith apprised my uncle declaring he would stand by him to the last drop of his blood and unflinging his carbine prepared for action the squire had pistols in the pockets of the coach and resolved to make use of them directly but he was effectually prevented by his female companions who flung themselves about his neck and screamed in concertat that instant who should come up at a handgallop but martin the highwayman who advancing to the coach begged the ladies would compose themselves for a moment then desiring clinker to follow him to the charge he pulled a pistol out of his bosom and they rode up together to give battle to the rogues who having fired at a great distance fled across the common they were in pursuit of the fugitives when i came up not a little alarmed at the shrieks in the coach where i found my uncle in a violent rage without his periwig struggling to disentangle himself from tabby and the other two and swearing with great vociferation before i had time to interpose martin and clinker returned from the pursuit and the former payed his compliments with great politeness giving us to understand that the fellows had scampered off and that he believed they were a couple of raw prentices from london he commended clinker for his courage and said if we would give him leave he would have the honour to accompany us as far as stevenage where he had some business  the squire having recollected and adjusted himself was the first to laugh at his own situation but it was not without difficulty that tabbys arms could be untwisted from his neck liddys teeth chattered and jenkins was threatened with a fit as usual i had communicated to my uncle the character of martin as it was described by the constable and he was much struck with its singularityhe could not suppose the fellow had any design on our company which was so numerous and well armed he therefore thanked him for the service he had just done them said he would be glad of his company and asked him to dine with us at hatfield this invitation might not have been agreeable to the ladies had they known the real profession of our guest but this was a secret to all except my uncle and myself mrs tabitha however would by no means consent to proceed with a case of loaded pistols in the coach and they were forthwith discharged in complaisance to her and the rest of the women  being gratified in this particular she became remarkably goodhumoured and at dinner behaved in the most affable manner to mr martin with whose polite address and agreeable conversation she seemed to be much taken after dinner the landlord accosting me in the yard asked with a significant look if the gentleman that rode the sorrel belonged to our companyi understand his meaning but answered no that he had come up with us on the common and helped us to drive away two fellows that looked like highwaymenhe nodded three times distinctly as much as to say he knows his cue then he inquired if one of those men was mounted on a bay mare and the other on a chestnut gelding with a white streak down his forehead and being answered in the affirmative he assured me they had robbed three postchaises this very morningi inquired in my turn if mr martin was of his acquaintance and nodding thrice again he answered that he had seen the gentleman  before we left hatfield my uncle fixing his eyes on martin with such expression as is more easily conceived than described asked if he often travelled that road and he replied with a look which denoted his understanding the question that he very seldom did business in that part of the country in a word this adventurer favoured us with his company to the neighbourhood of stevenage where he took his leave of the coach and me in very polite terms and turned off upon a crossroad that led to a village on the leftat supper mrs tabby was very full in the praise of mr martins goodsense and goodbreeding and seemed to regret that she had not a further opportunity to make some experiment upon his affection in the morning my uncle was not a little surprised to receive from the waiter a billet couched in these words   sir  i could easily perceive from your looks when i had the honour to converse with you at hatfield that my character is not unknown to you and i dare say you wont think it strange that i should be glad to change my present way of life for any other honest occupation let it be ever so humble that will afford me bread in moderation and sleep in safetyperhaps you may think i flatter when i say that from the moment i was witness to your generous concern in the cause of your servant i conceived a particular esteem and veneration for your person and yet what i say is true i should think myself happy if i could be admitted into your protection and service as housesteward clerk butler or bailiff for either of which places i think myself tolerably well qualified and sure i am i should not be found deficient in gratitude and fidelityat the same time i am very sensible how much you must deviate from the common maxims of discretion even in putting my professions to the trial but i dont look upon you as a person that thinks in the ordinary stile and the delicacy of my situation will i know justify this address to a heart warmed with beneficence and compassionunderstanding you are going pretty far north i shall take an opportunity to throw myself in your way again before you reach the borders of scotland and i hope by that time you will have taken into consideration the truly distressful case of  honoured sir your very humble and devoted servant edward martin  the squire having perused this letter put it into my hand without saying a syllable and when i had read it we looked at each other in silence from a certain sparkling in his eyes i discovered there was more in his heart than he cared to express with his tongue in favour of poor martin and this was precisely my own feeling which he did not fail to discern by the same means of communicationwhat shall we do said he to save this poor sinner from the gallows and make him a useful member of the commonwealth and yet the proverb says save a thief from the gallows and hell cut your throat i told him i really believed martin was capable of giving the proverb the lie and that i should heartily concur in any step he might take in favour of his solicitation we mutually resolved to deliberate upon the subject and in the mean time proceeded on our journey the roads having been broken up by the heavy rains in the spring were so rough that although we travelled very slowly the jolting occasioned such pain to my uncle that he was become exceedingly peevish when we arrived at this place which lies about eight miles from the postroad between wetherby and boroughbridge  harrigatewater so celebrated for its efficacy in the scurvy and other distempers is supplied from a copious spring in the hollow of a wild common round which a good many houses have been built for the convenience of the drinkers though few of them are inhabited most of the company lodge at some distance in five separate inns situated in different parts of the commons from whence they go every morning to the well in their own carriages the lodgers of each inn form a distinct society that eat together and there is a commodious public room where they breakfast in disabille at separate tables from eight oclock till eleven as they chance or chuse to come inhere also they drink tea in the afternoon and play at cards or dance in the evening one custom however prevails which i looked upon as a solecism in politeness the ladies treat with tea in their turns and even girls of sixteen are not exempted from this shameful impositionthere is a public ball by subscription every night at one of the houses to which all the company from the others are admitted by tickets and indeed harrigate treads upon the heels of bath in the articles of gaiety and dissipationwith this difference however that here we are more sociable and familiar one of the inns is already full up to the very garrets having no less than fifty lodgers and as many servants our family does not exceed thirtysix and i should be sorry to see the number augmented as our accommodations wont admit of much increase  at present the company is more agreeable than one could expect from an accidental assemblage of persons who are utter strangers to one anotherthere seems to be a general disposition among us to maintain goodfellowship and promote the purposes of humanity in favour of those who come hither on the score of health i see several faces which we left at bath although the majority are of the northern counties and many come from scotland for the benefit of these watersin such a variety there must be some originals among whom mrs tabitha bramble is not the most inconsiderableno place where there is such an intercourse between the sexes can be disagreeable to a lady of her views and temperamentshe has had some warm disputes at table with a lame parson from northumberland on the new birth and the insignificance of moral virtue and her arguments have been reinforced by an old scotch lawyer in a rye periwig who though he has lost his teeth and the use of his limbs can still wag his tongue with great volubility he has paid her such fulsome compliments upon her piety and learning as seem to have won her heart and she in her turn treats him with such attention as indicates a design upon his person but by all accounts he is too much of a fox to be inveigled into any snare that she can lay for his affection  we do not propose to stay long at harrigate though at present it is our headquarters from whence we shall make some excursions to visit two or three of our rich relations who are settled in this countrypray remember me to all our friends of jesus and allow me to be still  yours affectionately j melford harrigate june        to dr lewis  dear doctor  considering the tax we pay for turnpikes the roads of this county constitute a most intolerable grievance between newark and weatherby i have suffered more from jolting and swinging than ever i felt in the whole course of my life although the carriage is remarkably commodious and well hung and the postilions were very careful in driving i am now safely housed at the new inn at harrigate whither i came to satisfy my curiosity rather than with any view of advantage to my health and truly after having considered all the parts and particulars of the place i cannot account for the concourse of people one finds here upon any other principle but that of caprice which seems to be the character of our nation  harrigate is a wild common bare and bleak without tree or shrub or the least signs of cultivation and the people who come to drink the water are crowded together in paltry inns where the few tolerable rooms are monopolized by the friends and favourites of the house and all the rest of the lodgers are obliged to put up with dirty holes where there is neither space air nor convenience my apartment is about ten feet square and when the folding bed is down there is just room sufficient to pass between it and the fire one might expect indeed that there would be no occasion for a fire at midsummer but here the climate is so backward that an ash tree which our landlord has planted before my window is just beginning to put forth its leaves and i am fain to have my bed warmed every night  as for the water which is said to have effected so many surprising cures i have drank it once and the first draught has cured me of all desire to repeat the medicinesome people say it smells of rotten eggs and others compare it to the scourings of a foul gunit is generally supposed to be strongly impregnated with sulphur and dr shaw in his book upon mineral water says he has seen flakes of sulphur floating in the wellpace tanti viri i for my part have never observed any thing like sulphur either in or about the well neither do i find that any brimstone has ever been extracted from the water as for the smell if i may be allowed to judge from my own organs it is exactly that of bilgewater and the saline taste of it seems to declare that it is nothing else than salt water putrified in the bowels of the earth i was obliged to hold my nose with one hand while i advanced the glass to my mouth with the other and after i had made shift to swallow it my stomach could hardly retain what it had receivedthe only effects it produced were sickness griping and insurmountable disgusti can hardly mention it without pukingthe world is strangely misled by the affectation of singularity i cannot help suspecting that this water owes its reputation in a great measure to its being so strikingly offensiveon the same kind of analogy a german doctor has introduced hemlock and other poisons as specifics into the materia medicai am persuaded that all the cures ascribed to the harrigate water would have been as efficaciously and infinitely more agreeably performed by the internal and external use of seawater sure i am this last is much less nauseous to the taste and smell and much more gentle in its operation as a purge as well as more extensive in its medical qualities  two days ago we went across the country to visit squire burdock who married a first cousin of my father an heiress who brought him an estate of a thousand ayear this gentleman is a declared opponent of the ministry in parliament and having an opulent fortune piques himself upon living in the country and maintaining old english hospitalityby the bye this is a phrase very much used by the english themselves both in words and writing but i never heard of it out of the island except by way of irony and sarcasm what the hospitality of our forefathers has been i should be glad to see recorded rather in the memoirs of strangers who have visited our country and were the proper objects and judges of such hospitality than in the discourse and lucubrations of the modern english who seem to describe it from theory and conjecture certain it is we are generally looked upon by foreigners as a people totally destitute of this virtue and i never was in any country abroad where i did not meet with persons of distinction who complained of having been inhospitably used in great britain a gentleman of france italy or germany who has entertained and lodged an englishman at his house when he afterwards meets with his guest at london is asked to dinner at the saracenshead the turkshead the boarshead or the bear eats raw beef and butter drinks execrable port and is allowed to pay his share of the reckoning  but to return from this digression which my feeling for the honour of my country obliged me to makeour yorkshire cousin has been a mighty foxhunter before the lord but now he is too fat and unwieldy to leap ditches and fivebar gates nevertheless he still keeps a pack of hounds which are well exercised and his huntsman every night entertains him with the adventures of the days chace which he recites in a tone and terms that are extremely curious and significant in the mean time his broad brawn is scratched by one of his groomsthis fellow it seems having no inclination to curry any beast out of the stable was at great pains to scollop his nails in such a manner that the blood followed at every strokehe was in hopes that he would be dismissed from this disagreeable office but the event turned out contrary to his expectationhis master declared he was the best scratcher in the family and now he will not suffer any other servant to draw a nail upon his carcase  the squires lady is very proud without being stiff or inaccessible she receives even her inferiors in point of fortune with a kind of arrogant civility but then she thinks she has a right to treat them with the most ungracious freedoms of speech and never fails to let them know she is sensible of her own superior affluence in a word she speaks well of no living soul and has not one single friend in the world her husband hates her mortally but although the brute is sometimes so very powerful in him that he will have his own way he generally truckles to her dominion and dreads like a schoolboy the lash of her tongue on the other hand she is afraid of provoking him too far lest he should make some desperate effort to shake off her yokeshe therefore acquiesces in the proofs he daily gives of his attachment to the liberty of an english freeholder by saying and doing at his own table whatever gratifies the brutality of his disposition or contributes to the case of his person the house though large is neither elegant nor comfortableit looks like a great inn crowded with travellers who dine at the landlords ordinary where there is a great profusion of victuals and drink but mine host seems to be misplaced and i would rather dine upon filberts with a hermit than feed upon venison with a hog the footmen might be aptly compared to the waiters of a tavern if they were more serviceable and less rapacious but they are generally insolent and inattentive and so greedy that i think i can dine better and for less expence at the star and garter in pall mall than at our cousins castle in yorkshire the squire is not only accommodated with a wife but he is also blessed with an only son about two and twenty just returned from italy a complete fidler and dillettante and he slips no opportunity of manifesting the most perfect contempt for his own father  when we arrived there was a family of foreigners at the house on a visit to this virtuoso with whom they had been acquainted at the spa it was the count de melville with his lady on their way to scotland mr burdock had met with an accident in consequence of which both the count and i would have retired but the young gentleman and his mother insisted upon our staying dinner and their serenity seemed to be so little ruffled by what had happened that we complied with their invitation the squire had been brought home over night in his postchaise so terribly belaboured about the pate that he seemed to be in a state of stupefaction and had ever since remained speechless a country apothecary called grieve who lived in a neighbouring village having been called to his assistance had let him blood and applied a poultice to his head declaring that he had no fever nor any other bad symptom but the loss of speech if he really had lost that faculty but the young squire said this practitioner was an ignorantaccio that there was a fracture in the cranium and that there was a necessity for having him trepanned without loss of time his mother espousing this opinion had sent an express to york for a surgeon to perform the operation and he was already come with his prentice and instruments having examined the patients head he began to prepare his dressings though grieve still retained his first opinion that there was no fracture and was the more confirmed in it as the squire had passed the night in profound sleep uninterrupted by any catching or convulsion the york surgeon said he could not tell whether there was a fracture until he should take off the scalp but at any rate the operation might be of service in giving vent to any blood that might be extravasated either above or below the dura mater the lady and her son were clear for trying the experiment and grieve was dismissed with some marks of contempt which perhaps he owed to the plainness of his appearance he seemed to be about the middle age wore his own black hair without any sort of dressing by his garb one would have taken him for a quaker but he had none of the stiffness of that sect on the contrary he was very submissive respectful and remarkably taciturn  leaving the ladies in an apartment by themselves we adjourned to the patients chamber where the dressings and instruments were displayed in order upon a pewter dish the operator laying aside his coat and periwig equipped himself with a nightcap apron and sleeves while his prentice and footman seizing the squires head began to place it in a proper posturebut mark what followedthe patient bolting upright in the bed collared each of these assistants with the grasp of hercules exclaiming in a bellowing tone i hant lived so long in yorkshire to be trepanned by such vermin as you and leaping on the floor put on his breeches quietly to the astonishment of us all the surgeon still insisted upon the operation alleging it was now plain that the brain was injured and desiring the servants put him into bed again but nobody would venture to execute his orders or even to interpose when the squire turned him and his assistants out of doors and threw his apparatus out at the window having thus asserted his prerogative and put on his cloaths with the help of a valet the count with my nephew and me were introduced by his son and received with his usual stile of rustic civility then turning to signor macaroni with a sarcastic grin i tell thee what dick said he a mans scull is not to be bored every time his head is broken and ill convince thee and thy mother that i know as many tricks as eer an old fox in the west riding  we afterwards understood he had quarrelled at a public house with an exciseman whom he challenged to a bout at single stick in which he had been worsted and that the shame of this defeat had tied up his tongue as for madam she had shewn no concern for his disaster and now heard of his recovery without emotionshe had taken some little notice of my sister and niece though rather with a view to indulge her own petulance than out of any sentiment of regard to our familyshe said liddy was a fright and ordered her woman to adjust her head before dinner but she would not meddle with tabby whose spirit she soon perceived was not to be irritated with impunity at table she acknowledged me so far as to say she had heard of my father though she hinted that he had disobliged her family by making a poor match in wales she was disagreeably familiar in her enquiries about our circumstances and asked if i intended to bring up my nephew to the law i told her that as he had an independent fortune he should follow no profession but that of a country gentleman and that i was not without hopes of procuring for him a seat in parliamentpray cousin said she what may his fortune be when i answered that with what i should be able to give him he would have better than two thousand a year she replied with a disdainful toss of her head that it would be impossible for him to preserve his independence on such a paultry provision  not a little nettled at this arrogant remark i told her i had the honour to sit in parliament with her father when he had little more than half that income and i believed there was not a more independent and incorruptible member in the house ay but times are changed cried the squirecountry gentlemen nowadays live after another fashion my table alone stands me in a cool thousand a quarter though i raise my own stock import my own liquors and have every thing at the first handtrue it is i keep open house and receive all corners for the honour of old england if that be the case said i tis a wonder you can maintain it at so small an expence but every private gentleman is not expected to keep a caravanserai for the accommodation of travellers indeed if every individual lived in the same stile you would not have such a number of guests at your table of consequence your hospitality would not shine so bright for the glory of the west riding the young squire tickled by this ironical observation exclaimed o che burlahis mother eyed me in silence with a supercilious air and the father of the feast taking a bumper of october my service to you cousin bramble said he i have always heard there was something keen and biting in the air of the welch mountains  i was much pleased with the count de melville who is sensible easy and polite and the countess is the most amiable woman i ever beheld in the afternoon they took leave of their entertainers and the young gentleman mounting his horse undertook to conduct their coach through the park while one of their servants rode round to give notice to the rest whom they had left at a public house on the road the moment their backs were turned the censorious daemon took possession of our yorkshire landlady and our sister tabithathe former observed that the countess was a good sort of a body but totally ignorant of good breeding consequently aukward in her address the squire said he did not pretend to the breeding of any thing but colts but that the jade would be very handsome if she was a little more in flesh handsome cried tabby she has indeed a pair of black eyes without any meaning but then there is not a good feature in her face i know not what you call good features in wales replied our landlord but theyll pass in yorkshire then turning to liddy he added what say you my pretty redstreakwhat is your opinion of the countess i think cried liddy with great emotion shes an angel tabby chid her for talking with such freedom in company and the lady of the house said in a contemptuous tone she supposed miss had been brought up at some country boardingschool  our conversation was suddenly interrupted by the young gentleman who galloped into the yard all aghast exclaiming that the coach was attacked by a great number of highwaymen my nephew and i rushed out found his own and his servants horse ready saddled in the stable with pistols in the capswe mounted instantly ordering clinker and dutton to follow with all possible expedition but notwithstanding all the speed we could make the action was over before we arrived and the count with his lady safe lodged at the house of grieve who had signalized himself in a very remarkable manner on this occasion at the turning of a lane that led to the village where the counts servants remained a couple of robbers ahorseback suddenly appeared with their pistols advanced one kept the coachman in awe and the other demanded the counts money while the young squire went off at full speed without ever casting a look behind the count desiring the thief to withdraw his pistol as the lady was in great terror delivered his purse without making the least resistance but not satisfied with this booty which was pretty considerable the rascal insisted upon rifling her of her carrings and necklace and the countess screamed with affright her husband exasperated at the violence with which she was threatened wrested the pistol out of the fellows hand and turning it upon him snapped it in his face but the robber knowing there was no charge in it drew another from his bosom and in all probability would have killed him on the spot had not his life been saved by a wonderful interposition grieve the apothecary chancing to pass that very instant ran up to the coach and with a crabstick which was all the weapon he had brought the fellow to the ground with the first blow then seizing his pistol presented it at his colleague who fired his piece at random and fled without further opposition the other was secured by the assistance of the count and the coachman and his legs being tied under the belly of his own horse grieve conducted him to the village whither also the carriage proceeded it was with great difficulty the countess could be kept from swooning but at last she was happily conveyed to the house of the apothecary who went into the shop to prepare some drops for her while his wife and daughter administered to her in another apartment  i found the count standing in the kitchen with the parson of the parish and expressing much impatience to see his protector whom as yet he had scarce found time to thank for the essential service he had done him and the countessthe daughter passing at the same time with a glass of water monsieur de melville could not help taking notice of her figure which was strikingly engagingay said the parson she is the prettiest girl and the best girl in all my parish and if i could give my son an estate of ten thousand a year he should have my consent to lay it at her feet if mr grieve had been as solicitious about getting money as he has been in performing all the duties of a primitive christian he would not have hung so long upon his hands what is her name said i sixteen years ago answered the vicar i christened her by the names of seraphina melvilia ha what how cried the count eagerly sure you said seraphina melvilia i did said he mr grieve told me those were the names of two noble persons abroad to whom he had been obliged for more than life  the count without speaking another syllable rushed into the parlour crying this is your goddaughter my dear mrs grieve then seizing the countess by the hand exclaimed with great agitation o madam o siri ami am your poor elinorthis is my seraphina melvilia o child these are the count and countess of melville the generous the glorious benefactors of thy once unhappy parents  the countess rising from her scat threw her arms about the neck of the amiable seraphina and clasped her to her breast with great tenderness while she herself was embraced by the weeping mother this moving scene was completed by the entrance of grieve himself who falling on his knees before the count behold said he a penitent who at length can look upon his patron without shrinking ah ferdinand cried he raising and folding him in his arms the playfellow of my infancythe companion of my youthis it to you then i am indebted for my life heaven has heard my prayer said the other and given me an opportunity to prove myself not altogether unworthy of your clemency and protection he then kissed the hand of the countess while monsieur de melville saluted his wife and lovely daughter and all of us were greatly affected by this pathetic recognition  in a word grieve was no other than ferdinand count fathom whose adventures were printed many years ago being a sincere convert to virtue he had changed his name that he might elude the enquiries of the count whose generous allowance he determined to forego that he might have no dependence but upon his own industry and moderation he had accordingly settled in this village as a practitioner in surgery and physic and for some years wrestled with all the miseries of indigence which however he and his wife had borne with the most exemplary resignation at length by dint of unwearied attention to the duties of his profession which he exercised with equal humanity and success he had acquired tolerable share of business among the farmers and common people which enabled him to live in a decent manner he had been scarce ever seen to smile was unaffectedly pious and all the time he could spare from the avocations of his employment he spent in educating his daughter and in studying for his own improvement in short the adventurer fathom was under the name of grieve universally respected among the commonalty of this district as a prodigy of learning and virtue these particulars i learned from the vicar when we quitted the room that they might be under no restraint in their mutual effusions i make no doubt that grieve will be pressed to leave off business and reunite himself to the counts family and as the countess seemed extremely fond of his daughter she will in all probability insist upon seraphinas accompanying her to scotland  having paid our compliments to these noble persons we returned to the squires where we expected an invitation to pass the night which was wet and raw but it seems squire burdocks hospitality reached not so far for the honour of yorkshire we therefore departed in the evening and lay at an inn where i caught cold  in hope of riding it down before it could take fast hold on my constitution i resolved to visit another relation one mr pimpernel who lived about a dozen miles from the place where we lodged pimpernel being the youngest of four sons was bred an attorney at furnivals inn but all his elder brothers dying he got himself called to the bar for the honour of his family and soon after this preferment succeeded to his fathers estate which was very considerable he carried home with him all the knavish chicanery of the lowest pettifogger together with a wife whom he had purchased of a drayman for twenty pounds and he soon found means to obtain a dedimus as an acting justice of peace he is not only a sordid miser in his disposition but his avarice is mingled with a spirit of despotism which is truly diabolicalhe is a brutal husband an unnatural parent a harsh master an oppressive landlord a litigious neighbour and a partial magistrate friends he has none and in point of hospitality and good breeding our cousin burdock is a prince in comparison of this ungracious miscreant whose house is the lively representation of a gaol our reception was suitable to the character i have sketched had it depended upon the wife we should have been kindly treatedshe is really a good sort of a woman in spite of her low original and well respected in the country but she has not interest enough in her own house to command a draught of table beer far less to bestow any kind of education on her children who run about like tagged colts in a state of naturepox on him he is such a dirty fellow that i have not patience to prosecute the subject  by that time we reached harrigate i began to be visited by certain rheumatic symptoms the scotch lawyer mr micklewhimmen recommended a hot bath of these waters so earnestly that i was overpersuaded to try the experimenthe had used it often with success and always stayed an hour in the bath which was a tub filled with harrigate water heated for the purpose if i could hardly bear the smell of a single tumbler when cold you may guess how my nose was regaled by the streams arising from a hot bath of the same fluid at night i was conducted into a dark hole on the ground floor where the tub smoaked and stunk like the pot of acheron in one corner and in another stood a dirty bed provided with thick blankets in which i was to sweat after coming out of the bath my heart seemed to die within me when i entered this dismal bagnio and found my brain assaulted by such insufferable effluvia i cursed micklewhimmen for not considering that my organs were formed on this side of the tweed but being ashamed to recoil upon the threshold i submitted to the process  after having endured all but real suffocation for above a quarter of an hour in the tub i was moved to the bed and wrapped in blanketsthere i lay a full hour panting with intolerable heat but not the least moisture appearing on my skin i was carried to my own chamber and passed the night without closing an eye in such a flutter of spirits as rendered me the most miserable wretch in being i should certainly have run distracted if the rarefaction of my blood occasioned by that stygian bath had not burst the vessels and produced a violent haemorrhage which though dreadful and alarming removed the horrible disquieti lost two pounds of blood and more on this occasion and find myself still weak and languid but i believe a little exercise will forward my recovery and therefore i am resolved to set out tomorrow for york in my way to scarborough where i propose to brace up my fibres by seabathing which i know is one of your favourite specificks there is however one disease for which you have found as yet no specific and that is old age of which this tedious unconnected epistle is an infallible symptom what therefore cannot be cured must be endured by you as well as by  yours matt bramble harrigate june        to sir watkin phillips bart of jesus college oxon  dear knight  the manner of living at harrigate was so agreeable to my disposition that i left the place with some regretour aunt tabby would have probably made some objection to our departing so soon had not an accident embroiled her with mr micklewhimmen the scotch advocate on whose heart she had been practising from the second day after our arrivalthat original though seemingly precluded from the use of his limbs had turned his genius to good accountin short by dint of groaning and whining he had excited the compassion of the company so effectually that an old lady who occupied the very best apartment in the house gave it up for his case and convenience when his man led him into the long room all the females were immediately in commotionone set an elbowchair another shook up the cushion a third brought a stool and a fourth a pillow for the accommodation of his feet two ladies of whom tabby was always one supported him into the diningroom and placed him properly at the table and his taste was indulged with a succession of delicacies culled by their fair hands all this attention he repaid with a profusion of compliments and benedictions which were not the less agreeable for being delivered in the scottish dialect as for mrs tabitha his respects were particularly addressed to her and he did not fail to mingle them with religious reflections touching free grace knowing her bias to methodism which he also professed upon a calvinistical model  for my part i could not help thinking this lawyer was not such an invalid as he pretended to be i observed he ate very heartily three times a day and though his bottle was marked stomachic tincture he had recourse to it so often and seemed to swallow it with such peculiar relish that i suspected it was not compounded in the apothecarys shop or the chemists laboratory one day while he was earnest in discourse with mrs tabitha and his servant had gone out on some occasion or other i dexterously exchanged the labels and situation of his bottle and mine and having tasted his tincture found it was excellent claret i forthwith handed it about me to some of my neighbours and it was quite emptied before mr micklewhimmen had occasion to repeat his draught at length turning about he took hold of my bottle instead of his own and filling a large glass drank to the health of mrs tabitha it had scarce touched his lips when he perceived the change which had been put upon him and was at first a little out of countenance he seemed to retire within himself in order to deliberate and in half a minute his resolution was taken addressing himself to our quarter i give the gentleman credit for his wit said he it was a gude practical joke but sometimes hi joci in seria ducunt malai hope for his own sake he has na drank all the liccor for it was a vara poorful infusion of jallap in bourdeaux wine at its possable he may ha taen sic a dose as will produce a terrible catastrophe in his ain booels  by far the greater part of the contents had fallen to the share of a young clothier from leeds who had come to make a figure at harrigate and was in effect a great coxcomb in his way it was with a view to laugh at his fellowguests as well as to mortify the lawyer that he had emptied the bottle when it came to his turn and he had laughed accordingly but now his mirth gave way to his apprehensionhe began to spit to make wry faces and writhe himself into various contorsionsdamn the stuff cried he i thought it had a villainous twangpah he that would cozen a scot mun get oope betimes and take old scratch for his counsellor in troth mester what dye caum replied the lawyer your wit has run you into a filthy puddleim truly consarned for your waeful casethe best advice i can give you in sic a delemma is to send an express to rippon for doctor waugh without delay and in the mean time swallow all the oil and butter you can find in the hoose to defend your poor stomach and intastines from the villication of the particles of the jallap which is vara violent even when taken in moderation  the poor clothiers torments had already begun he retired roaring with pain to his own chamber the oil was swallowed and the doctor sent for but before he arrived the miserable patient had made such discharges upwards and downwards that nothing remained to give him further offence and this double evacuation was produced by imagination alone for what he had drank was genuine wine of bourdeaux which the lawyer had brought from scotland for his own private use the clothier finding the joke turn out so expensive and disagreeable quitted the house next morning leaving the triumph to micklewhimmen who enjoyed it internally without any outward signs of exultationon the contrary he affected to pity the young man for what he had suffered and acquired fresh credit from this shew of moderation  it was about the middle of the night which succeeded this adventure that the vent of the kitchen chimney being foul the soot took fire and the alarm was given in a dreadful manner every body leaped naked out of bed and in a minute the whole house was filled with cries and confusionthere was two stairs in the house and to these we naturally ran but they were both so blocked up by the people pressing one upon another that it seemed impossible to pass without throwing down and trampling upon the women in the midst of this anarchy mr micklewhimmen with a leathern portmanteau on his back came running as nimble as a buck along the passage and tabby in her underpetticoat endeavouring to hook him under the arm that she might escape through his protection he very fairly pushed her down crying na na gude faith charity begins at hame without paying the least respect to the shrieks and intreaties of his female friends he charged through the midst of the crowd overturning every thing that opposed him and actually fought his way to the bottom of the staircaseby this time clinker had found a ladder by which he entered the window of my uncles chamber where our family was assembled and proposed that we should make our exit successively by that conveyance the squire exhorted his sister to begin the descent but before she could resolve her woman mrs winifred jenkins in a transport of terror threw herself out at the window upon the ladder while humphry dropped upon the ground that he might receive her in her descentthis maiden was just as she had started out of bed the moon shone very bright and a fresh breeze of wind blowing none of mrs winifreds beauties could possibly escape the view of the fortunate clinker whose heart was not able to withstand the united force of so many charms at least i am much mistaken if he has not been her humble slave from that momenthe received her in his arms and giving her his coat to protect her from the weather ascended again with admirable dexterity  at that instant the landlord of the house called out with an audible voice that the fire was extinguished and the ladies had nothing further to fear this was a welcome note to the audience and produced an immediate effect the shrieking ceased and a confused sound of expostulation ensued i conducted mrs tabitha and my sister to their own chamber where liddy fainted away but was soon brought to herself then i went to offer my services to the other ladies who might want assistancethey were all scudding through the passage to their several apartments and as the thoroughfair was lighted by two lamps i had a pretty good observation of them in their transit but as most of them were naked to the smock and all their heads shrowded in huge nightcaps i could not distinguish one face from another though i recognized some of their voicesthese were generally plaintive some wept some scolded and some prayedi lifted up one poor old gentlewoman who had been overturned and sore bruised by a multitude of feet and this was also the case with the lame person from northumberland whom micklewhimmen had in his passage overthrown though not with impunity for the cripple in falling gave him such a good pelt on the head with his crutch that the blood followed  as for this lawyer he waited below till the hurly burly was over and then stole softly to his own chamber from whence he did not venture to make a second sally till eleven in the forenoon when he was led into the public room by his own servant and another assistant groaning most woefully with a bloody napkin round his head but things were greatly alteredthe selfish brutality of his behaviour on the stairs had steeled their hearts against all his arts and addressnot a soul offered to accommodate him with a chair cushion or footstool so that he was obliged to sit down on a hard benchin that position he looked around with a rueful aspect and bowing very low said in a whining tone your most humble servant ladiesfire is a dreadful calamityfire purifies gold and it ties friendship cried mrs tabitha bridling yea madam replied micklewhimmen and it trieth discretion alsoif discretion consists in forsaking a friend in adversity you are eminently possessed of that virtue resumed our auntna madam rejoined the advocate well i wot i cannot claim any merit from the mode of my retreatyell please to observe ladies there are twa independent principles that actuate our natureone is instinct which we have in common with the brute creation and the other is reasonnoo in certain great emergencies when the faculty of reason is suspended instinct taks the lead and when this predominates having no affinity with reason it pays no sort of regard to its connections it only operates for the preservation of the individual and that by the most expeditious and effectual means therefore begging your pardon ladies im no accountable in foro conscientioe for what i did while under the influence of this irresistible pooer  here my uncle interposing i should be glad to know said he whether it was instinct that prompted you to retreat with bag and baggage for i think you had a portmanteau on your shoulder the lawyer answered without hesitation gif i might tell my mind freely withoot incuring the suspicion of presumption i should think it was something superior to either reason or instinct which suggested that measure and this on a twafold accoont in the first place the portmanteau contained the writings of a worthy noblemans estate and their being burnt would have occasioned a loss that could not be repaired secondly my good angel seems to have laid the portmanteau on my shoulders by way of defence to sustain the violence of a most inhuman blow from the crutch of a reverend clergyman which even in spite of that medium hath wounded me sorely even unto the pericranium by your own doctrine cried the parson who chanced to be present i am not accountable for the blow which was the effect of instinct i crave your pardon reverend sir said the other instinct never acts but for the preservation of the individual but your preservation was out of the caseyou had already received the damage and therefore the blow must be imputed to revenge which is a sinful passion that ill becomes any christian especially a protestant divine and let me tell you most reverend doctor gin i had a mind to plea the law would hauld my libel relevant why the damage is pretty equal on both sides cried the parson your head is broke and my crutch is snapt in the middle now if you will repair the one i will be at the expence of curing the other  this sally raised the laugh against micklewhimmen who began to look grave when my uncle in order to change the discourse observed that instinct had been very kind to him in another respect for it had restored to him the use of his limbs which in his exit he had moved with surprising agilityhe replied that it was the nature of fear to brace up the nerves and mentioned some surprising feats of strength and activity performed by persons under the impulse of terror but he complained that in his own particular the effects had ceased when the cause was taken awaythe squire said he would lay a teadrinking on his head that he should dance a scotch measure without making a false step and the advocate grinning called for the pipera fidler being at hand this original started up with his bloody napkin over his black tyeperiwig and acquitted himself in such a manner as excited the mirth of the whole company but he could not regain the good graces of mrs tabby who did not understand the principle of instinct and the lawyer did not think it worth his while to proceed to further demonstration  from harrigate we came hither by the way of york and here we shall tarry some days as my uncle and tabitha are both resolved to make use of the waters scarborough though a paltry town is romantic from its situation along a cliff that overhangs the sea the harbour is formed by a small elbow of land that runs out as a natural mole directly opposite to the town and on that side is the castle which stands very high of considerable extent and before the invention of gunpowder was counted impregnable at the other end of scarborough are two public rooms for the use of the company who resort to this place in the summer to drink the waters and bathe in the sea and the diversions are pretty much on the same footing here as at bath the spa is a little way beyond the town on this side under a cliff within a few paces of the sea and thither the drinkers go every morning in dishabille but the descent is by a great number of steps which invalids find very inconvenient betwixt the well and the harbour the bathing machines are ranged along the beach with all their proper utensils and attendants you have never seen one of these machinesimage to yourself a small snug wooden chamber fixed upon a wheelcarriage having a door at each end and on each side a little window above a bench belowthe bather ascending into this apartment by wooden steps shuts himself in and begins to undress while the attendant yokes a horse to the end next the sea and draws the carriage forwards till the surface of the water is on a level with the floor of the dressingroom then he moves and fixes the horse to the other endthe person within being stripped opens the door to the seaward where he finds the guide ready and plunges headlong into the waterafter having bathed he reascends into the apartment by the steps which had been shifted for that purpose and puts on his clothes at his leisure while the carriage is drawn back again upon the dry land so that he has nothing further to do but to open the door and come down as he went upshould he be so weak or ill as to require a servant to put off and on his clothes there is room enough in the apartment for half a dozen people the guides who attend the ladies in the water are of their own sex and they and the female bathers have a dress of flannel for the sea nay they are provided with other conveniences for the support of decorum a certain number of the machines are fitted with tilts that project from the seaward ends of them so as to screen the bathers from the view of all persons whatsoeverthe beach is admirably adapted for this practice the descent being gently gradual and the sand soft as velvet but then the machines can be used only at a certain time of the tide which varies every day so that sometimes the bathers are obliged to rise very early in the morningfor my part i love swimming as an exercise and can enjoy it at all times of the tide without the formality of an apparatusyou and i have often plunged together into the isis but the sea is a much more noble bath for health as well as pleasure you cannot conceive what a flow of spirits it gives and how it braces every sinew of the human frame were i to enumerate half the diseases which are every day cured by seabathing you might justly say you had received a treatise instead of a letter from  your affectionate friend and servant j melford scarborough july       to dr lewis  i have not found all the benefit i expected at scarborough where i have been these eight daysfrom harrigate we came hither by the way of york where we stayed only one day to visit the castle the minster and the assemblyroom the first which was heretofore a fortress is now converted to a prison and is the best in all respects i ever saw at home or abroadit stands in a high situation extremely well ventilated and has a spacious area within the walls for the health and convenience of all the prisoners except those whom it is necessary to secure in close confinement even these last have all the comforts that the nature of their situation can admit here the assizes are held in a range of buildings erected for that purpose  as for the minster i know not how to distinguish it except by its great size and the height of its spire from those other ancient churches in different parts of the kingdom which used to be called monuments of gothic architecture but it is now agreed that this stile is saracen rather than gothic and i suppose it was first imported into england from spain great part of which was under the dominion of the moors those british architects who adopted this stile dont seem to have considered the propriety of their adoption the climate of the country possessed by the moors or saracens both in africa and spain was so exceedingly hot and dry that those who built places of worship for the multitude employed their talents in contriving edifices that should be cool and for this purpose nothing could be better adopted than those buildings vast narrow dark and lofty impervious to the sunbeams and having little communication with the scorched external atmosphere but ever affording a refreshing coolness like subterranean cellars in the heats of summer or natural caverns in the bowels of huge mountains but nothing could be more preposterous than to imitate such a mode of architecture in a country like england where the climate is cold and the air eternally loaded with vapours and where of consequence the builders intention should be to keep the people dry and warmfor my part i never entered the abbey church at bath but once and the moment i stept over the threshold i found myself chilled to the very marrow of my bones when we consider that in our churches in general we breathe a gross stagnated air surcharged with damps from vaults tombs and charnelhouses may we not term them so many magazines of rheums created for the benefit of the medical faculty and safely aver that more bodies are lost than souls saved by going to church in the winter especially which may be said to engross eight months in the year i should be glad to know what offence it would give to tender consciences if the house of god was made more comfortable or less dangerous to the health of valetudinarians and whether it would not be an encouragement to piety as well as the salvation of many lives if the place of worship was well floored wainscotted warmed and ventilated and its area kept sacred from the pollution of the dead the practice of burying in churches was the effect of ignorant superstition influenced by knavish priests who pretended that the devil could have no power over the defunct if he was interred in holy ground and this indeed is the only reason that can be given for consecrating all cemeteries even at this day  the external appearance of an old cathedral cannot be but displeasing to the eye of every man who has any idea of propriety or proportion even though he may be ignorant of architecture as a science and the long slender spire puts one in mind of a criminal impaled with a sharp stake rising up through his shoulderthese towers or steeples were likewise borrowed from the mahometans who having no bells used such minarets for the purpose of calling the people to prayersthey may be of further use however for making observations and signals but i would vote for their being distinct from the body of the church because they serve only to make the pile more barbarous or saracenical  there is nothing of this arabic architecture in the assembly room which seems to me to have been built upon a design of palladio and might be converted into an elegant place of worship but it is indifferently contrived for that sort of idolatry which is performed in it at present the grandeur of the fane gives a diminutive effect to the little painted divinities that are adorned in it and the company on a ballnight must look like an assembly of fantastic fairies revelling by moonlight among the columns of a grecian temple  scarborough seems to be falling off in point of reputation all these places bath excepted have their vogue and then the fashion changes i am persuaded there are fifty spaws in england as efficacious and salutary as that of scarborough though they have not yet risen to fame and perhaps never will unless some medical encomiast should find an interest in displaying their virtues to the public viewbe that as it may recourse will always be had to this place for the convenience of sea bathing while this practice prevails but it were to be wished they would make the beach more accessible to invalids  i have here met with my old acquaintance hewett whom you have often heard me mention as one of the most original characters upon earthi first knew him at venice and afterwards saw him in different parts of italy where he was well known by the nickname of cavallo bianco from his appearing always mounted on a pale horse like death in the revelations you must remember the account i once gave you of a curious dispute he had at constantinople with a couple of turks in defence of the christian religion a dispute from which he acquired the epithet of demonstratorthe truth is howns no religion but that of nature but on this occasion he was stimulated to shew his parts for the honour of his countrysome years ago being in the campidoglio at rome he made up to the bust of jupiter and bowing very low exclaimed in the italian language i hope sir if ever you get your head above water again you will remember that i paid my respects to you in your adversity this sally was reported to the cardinal camerlengo and by him laid before pope benedict xiv who could not help laughing at the extravagance of the address and said to the cardinal those english heretics think they have a right to go to the devil in their own way  indeed h was the only englishman i ever knew who had resolution enough to live in his own way in the midst of foreigners for neither in dress diet customs or conversation did he deviate one tittle from the manner in which he had been brought up about twelve years ago he began a giro or circuit which he thus performedat naples where he fixed his headquarters he embarked for marseilles from whence he travelled with a voiturin to antibesthere he took his passage to genoa and lerici from which last place he proceeded by the way of cambratina to pisa and florenceafter having halted some time in this metropolis he set out with a vetturino for rome where he reposed himself a few weeks and then continued his route for naples in order to wait for the next opportunity of embarkationafter having twelve times described this circle he lately flew off at a tangent to visit some trees at his countryhouse in england which he had planted above twenty years ago after the plan of the double colonnade in the piazza of st peters at romehe came hither to scarborough to pay his respects to his noble friend and former pupil the m of g and forgetting that he is now turned of seventy sacrificed so liberally to bacchus that next day he was seized with a fit of the apoplexy which has a little impaired his memory but he retains all the oddity of his character in perfection and is going back to italy by the way of geneva that he may have a conference with his friend voltaire about giving the last blow to the christian superstitionhe intends to take shipping here for holland or hamburgh for it is a matter of great indifference to him at what part of the continent he first lands  when he was going abroad the last time he took his passage in a ship bound for leghorn and his baggage was actually embarked in going down the river by water he was by mistake put on board of another vessel under sail and upon inquiry understood she was bound to petersburghpetersburghpetersburgh said he i dont care if i go along with you he forthwith struck a bargain with the captain bought a couple of shirts of the mate and was safe conveyed to the court of muscovy from whence he travelled by land to receive his baggage at leghornhe is now more likely than ever to execute a whim of the same nature and i will hold any wager that as he cannot be supposed to live much longer according to the course of nature his exit will be as odd as his life has been extravagant  this gentleman crossed the sea to france visited and conferred with mr de voltaire at fernay resumed his old circuit at genoa and died in      at the house of vanini in florence being taken with a suppression of urine he resolved in imitation of pomponius atticus to take himself off by abstinence and this resolution he executed like an ancient roman he saw company to the last cracked his jokes conversed freely and entertained his guests with music on the third day of his fast he found himself entirely freed of his complaint but refused taking sustenance he said the most disagreeable part of the voyage was past and he should be a cursed fool indeed to put about ship when he was just entering the harbour in these sentiments he persisted without any marks of affectation and thus finished his course with such case and serenity as would have done honour to the firmest stoic of antiquity  but to return from one humourist to another you must know i have received benefit both from the chalybeate and the sea and would have used them longer had not a most ridiculous adventure by making me the towntalk obliged me to leave the place for i cant bear the thoughts of affording a spectacle to the multitude yesterday morning at six oclock i went down to the bathingplace attended by my servant clinker who waited on the beach as usualthe wind blowing from the north and the weather being hazy the water proved so chill that when i rose from my first plunge i could not help sobbing and bawling out from the effects of the cold clinker who heard me cry and saw me indistinctly a good way without the guide buffetting the waves took it for granted i was drowning and rushing into the sea clothes and all overturned the guide in his hurry to save his master i had swam out a few strokes when hearing a noise i turned about and saw clinker already up to his neck advancing towards me with all the wildness of terror in his aspectafraid he would get out of his depth i made haste to meet him when all of a sudden he seized me by one ear dragged me bellowing with pain upon the dry beach to the astonishment of all the people men and women and children there assembled  i was so exasperated by the pain of my ear and the disgrace of being exposed in such an attitude that in the first transport i struck him down then running back into the sea took shelter in the machine where my clothes had been deposited i soon recollected myself so far as to do justice to the poor fellow who in great simplicity of heart had acted from motives of fidelity and affectionopening the door of the machine which was immediately drawn on shore i saw him standing by the wheel dropping like a waterwork and trembling from head to foot partly from cold and partly from the dread of having offended his masteri made my acknowledgments for the blow he had received assured him i was not angry and insisted upon his going home immediately to shift his clothes a command which he could hardly find in his heart to execute so well disposed was he to furnish the mob with further entertainment at my expence clinkers intention was laudable without all doubt but nevertheless i am a sufferer by his simplicityi have had a burning heat and a strange buzzing noise in that ear ever since it was so roughly treated and i cannot walk the street without being pointed at as the monster that was hauled naked ashore upon the beachwell i affirm that folly is often more provoking than knavery aye and more mischievous too and whether a man had not better choose a sensible rogue than an honest simpleton for his servant is no matter of doubt with  yours matt bramble scarborough july       to sir watkin phillips bart of jesus college oxon  dear wat  we made a precipitate retreat from scarborough owing to the excessive delicacy of our squire who cannot bear the thoughts of being proetereuntium digito monstratus  one morning while he was bathing in the sea his man clinker took it in his head that his master was in danger of drowning and in this conceit plunging into the water he lugged him out naked on the beach and almost pulled off his ear in the operation you may guess how this atchievement was relished by mr bramble who is impatient irascible and has the most extravagant ideas of decency and decorum in the oeconomy of his own personin the first ebullition of his choler he knocked clinker down with his fist but he afterwards made him amends for his outrage and in order to avoid further notice of the people among whom this incident had made him remarkable he resolved to leave scarborough next day  we set out accordingly over the moors by the way of whitby and began our journey betimes in hopes of reaching stockton that night but in this hope we were disappointedin the afternoon crossing a deep gutter made by a torrent the coach was so hard strained that one of the irons which connect the frame snapt and the leather sling on the same side cracked in the middle the shock was so great that my sister liddy struck her head against mrs tabithas nose with such violence that the blood flowed and win jenkins was darted through a small window in that part of the carriage next the horses where she stuck like a bawd in the pillory till she was released by the hand of mr bramble we were eight miles distant from any place where we could be supplied with chaises and it was impossible to proceed with the coach until the damage should be repairedin this dilemma we discovered a blacksmiths forge on the edge of a small common about half a mile from the scene of our disaster and thither the postilions made shift to draw the carriage slowly while the company walked afoot but we found the blacksmith had been dead some days and his wife who had been lately delivered was deprived of her senses under the care of a nurse hired by the parish we were exceedingly mortified at this disappointment which however was surmounted by the help of humphry clinker who is a surprising compound of genius and simplicity finding the tools of the defunct together with some coals in the smithy he unscrewed the damaged iron in a twinkling and kindling a fire united the broken pieces with equal dexterity and dispatchwhile he was at work upon this operation the poor woman in the straw struck with the wellknown sound of the hammer and anvil started up and notwithstanding all the nurses efforts came running into the smithy where throwing her arms about clinkers neck ah jacob cried she how could you leave me in such a condition  this incident was too pathetic to occasion mirthit brought tears into the eyes of all present the poor widow was put to bed again and we did not leave the village without doing something for her benefiteven tabithas charity was awakened on this occasion as for the tenderhearted humphry clinker he hammered the iron and wept at the same timebut his ingenuity was not confined to his own province of farrier and blacksmithit was necessary to join the leather sling which had been broke and this service he likewise performed by means of a broken awl which he newpointed and ground a little hemp which he spun into lingels and a few tacks which he made for the purpose upon the whole we were in a condition to proceed in little more than an hour but even this delay obliged us to pass the night at gisboroughnext day we crossed the tees at stockton which is a neat agreeable town and there we resolved to dine with purpose to lie at durham  whom should we meet in the yard when we alighted but martin the adventurer having handed out the ladies and conducted them into an apartment where he payed his compliments to mrs tabby with his usual address he begged leave to speak to my uncle in another room and there in some confusion he made an apology for having taken the liberty to trouble him with a letter at stevenage he expressed his hope that mr bramble had bestowed some consideration on his unhappy case and repeated his desire of being taken into his service  my uncle calling me into the room told him that we were both very well inclined to rescue him from a way of life that was equally dangerous and dishonourable and that he should have no scruples in trusting to his gratitude and fidelity if he had any employment for him which he thought would suit his qualifications and his circumstances but that all the departments he had mentioned in his letter were filled up by persons of whose conduct he had no reason to complain of consequence he could not without injustice deprive any one of them of his bread nevertheless he declared himself ready to assist him in any feasible project either with his purse or credit  martin seemed deeply touched at this declarationthe tear started in his eye while he said in a faultering accentworthy siryour generosity oppresses mei never dreamed of troubling you for any pecuniary assistanceindeed i have no occasioni have been so lucky at billiards and betting in different places at buxton harrigate scarborough and newcastle races that my stock in readymoney amounts to three hundred pounds which i would willingly employ in prosecuting some honest scheme of life but my friend justice buzzard has set so many springs for my life that i am under the necessity of either retiring immediately to a remote part of the country where i can enjoy the protection of some generous patron or of quitting the kingdom altogether it is upon this alternative that i now beg leave to ask your advice i have had information of all your route since i had the honour to see you at stevenage and supposing you would come this way from scarborough i came hither last night from darlington to pay you my respects  it would be no difficult matter to provide you with an asylum in the country replied my uncle but a life of indolence and obscurity would not suit with your active and enterprizing dispositioni would therefore advise you to try your fortune in the east indiesi will give you a letter to a friend in london who will recommend you to the direction for a commission in the companys service and if that cannot be obtained you will at least be received as a volunteerin which case you may pay for your passage and i shall undertake to procure you such credentials that you will not be long without a commission  martin embraced the proposal with great eagerness it was therefore resolved that he should sell his horse and take a passage by sea for london to execute the project without delayin the mean time he accompanied us to durham were we took up our quarters for the night here being furnished with letters from my uncle he took his leave of us with strong symptoms of gratitude and attachment and set out for sunderland in order to embark in the first collier bound for the river thames he had not been gone half an hour when we were joined by another character which promised something extraordinarya tall meagre figure answering with his horse the description of don quixote mounted on rozinante appeared in the twilight at the inn door while my aunt and liddy stood at a window in the diningroomhe wore a coat the cloth of which had once been scarlet trimmed with brandenburgs now totally deprived of their metal and he had holstercaps and housing of the same stuff and same antiquity perceiving ladies at the window above he endeavoured to dismount with the most graceful air he could assume but the ostler neglecting to hold the stirrup when he wheeled off his right foot and stood with his whole weight on the other the girth unfortunately gave way the saddle turned down came the cavalier to the ground and his hat and perriwig falling off displayed a headpiece of various colours patched and plaistered in a woeful conditionthe ladies at the window above shrieked with affright on the supposition that the stranger had received some notable damages in his fall but the greatest injury he had sustained arose from the dishonour of his descent aggravated by the disgrace of exposing the condition of his cranium for certain plebeians that were about the door laughed aloud in the belief that the captain had got either a scald head or a broken head both equally opprobrious  he forthwith leaped up in a fury and snatching one of his pistols threatened to put the ostler to death when another squall from the women checked his resentment he then bowed to the window while he kissed the buttend of his pistol which he replaced adjusted his wig in great confusion and led his horse into the stableby this time i had come to the door and could not help gazing at the strange figure that presented itself to my view he would have measured above six feet in height had he stood upright but he stooped very much was very narrow in the shoulders and very thick in the calves of his legs which were cased in black spatterdashesas for his thighs they were long and slender like those of a grasshopper his face was at least half a yard in length brown and shrivelled with projecting cheekbones little grey eyes on the greenish hue a large hooknose a pointed chin a mouth from ear to car very ill furnished with teeth and a high narrow forehead well furrowed with wrinkles his horse was exactly in the stile of its rider a resurrection of dry bones which as we afterwards learned he valued exceedingly as the only present he had ever received in his life  having seen this favourite steed properly accommodated in the stable he sent up his compliments to the ladies begging permission to thank them in person for the marks of concern they had shewn at his disaster in the court yardas the squire said they could not decently decline his visit he was shewn up stairs and paid his respects in the scotch dialect with much formality leddies said he perhaps ye may be scandaleezed at the appearance of my heed made when it was uncovered by accident but i can assure you the condition you saw it in is neither the effects of diseases nor of drunkenness but an honest scar received in the service of my country he then gave us to understand that having been wounded at ticonderoga in america a party of indians rifled him scalped him broke his scull with the blow of a tomahawk and left him for dead on the field of battle but that being afterwards found with signs of life he had been cured in the french hospital though the loss of substance could not be repaired so that the scull was left naked in several places and these he covered with patches  there is no hold by which an englishman is sooner taken than that of compassionwe were immediately interested in behalf of this veteran even tabbys heart was melted but our pity was warmed with indignation when we learned that in the course of two sanguinary wars he had been wounded maimed mutilated taken and enslaved without ever having attained a higher rank than that of lieutenantmy uncles eyes gleamed and his nether lip quivered while he exclaimed i vow to god sir your case is a reproach to the servicethe injustice you have met with is so flagranti must crave your pardon sir cried the other interrupting him i complain of no injusticei purchased an ensigncy thirty years ago and in the course of service rose to a lieutenant according to my senioritybut in such a length of time resumed the squire you must have seen a great many young officers put over your headnevertheless said he i have no cause to murmurthey bought their preferment with their moneyi had no money to carry to market that was my misfortune but no body was to blamewhat no friend to advance a sum of money said mr bramble perhaps i might have borrowed money for the purchase of a company answered the other but that loan must have been refunded and i did not chuse to incumber myself with a debt of a thousand pounds to be payed from an income of ten shillings aday so you have spent the best part of your life cried mr bramble your youth your blood and your constitution amidst the dangers the difficulties the horrors and hardships of a war for the consideration of three or four shillings aday a consideration sir replied the scot with great warmth you are the man that does me injustice if you say or think i have been actuated by any such paltry considerationi am a gentleman and entered the service as other gentlemen do with such hopes and sentiments as honourable ambition inspiresif i have not been lucky in the lottery of life so neither do i think myself unfortunatei owe to no man a farthing i can always command a clean shirt a muttonchop and a truss of straw and when i die i shall leave effects sufficient to defray the expence of my burial  my uncle assured him he had no intention to give him the least offence by the observations he had made but on the contrary spoke from a sentiment of friendly regard to his interestthe lieutenant thanked him with a stiffness of civility which nettled our old gentleman who perceived that his moderation was all affected for whatsoever his tongue might declare his whole appearance denoted dissatisfactionin short without pretending to judge of his military merit i think i may affirm that this caledonian is a selfconceited pedant aukward rude and disputacioushe has had the benefit of a schooleducation seems to have read a good number of books his memory is tenacious and he pretends to speak several different languages but he is so addicted to wrangling that he will cavil at the clearest truths and in the pride of argumentation attempt to reconcile contradictionswhether his address and qualifications are really of that stamp which is agreeable to the taste of our aunt mrs tabitha or that indefatigable maiden is determined to shoot at every sort of game certain it is she has begun to practice upon the heart of the lieutenant who favoured us with his company to supper  i have many other things to say of this man of war which i shall communicate in a post or two mean while it is but reasonable that you should be indulged with some respite from those weary lucubrations of  yours j melford newcastle upon tyne july  0     to sir watkin phillips bart of jesus college oxon  dear phillips  in my last i treated you with a high flavoured dish in the character of the scotch lieutenant and i must present him once more for your entertainment it was our fortune to feed upon him the best part of three days and i do not doubt that he will start again in our way before we shall have finished our northern excursion the day after our meeting with him at durham proved so tempestuous that we did not choose to proceed on our journey and my uncle persuaded him to stay till the weather should clear up giving him at the same time a general invitation to our mess the man has certainly gathered a whole budget of shrewd observations but he brings them forth in such an ungracious manner as would be extremely disgusting if it was not marked by that characteristic oddity which never fails to attract the attentionhe and mr bramble discoursed and even disputed on different subjects in war policy the belles lettres law and metaphysics and sometimes they were warmed into such altercation as seemed to threaten an abrupt dissolution of their society but mr bramble set a guard over his own irascibility the more vigilantly as the officer was his guest and when in spite of all his efforts he began to wax warm the other prudently cooled in the same proportion  mrs tabitha chancing to accost her brother by the familiar diminutive of matt pray sir said the lieutenant is your name matthias you must know it is one of our uncles foibles to be ashamed of his name matthew because it is puritanical and this question chagrined him so much that he answered no by gd in a very abrupt tone of displeasurethe scot took umbrage at the manner of his reply and bristling up if i had known said he that you did not care to tell your name i should not have asked the questionthe leddy called you matt and i naturally thought it was matthiasperhaps it may be methuselah or metrodorus or metellus or mathurinus or malthinnus or matamorus or no cried my uncle laughing it is neither of those captain my name is matthew bramble at your servicethe truth is have a foolish pique at the name of matthew because it favours of those canting hypocrites who in cromwells time christened all their children by names taken from the scripture a foolish pique indeed cried mrs tabby and even sinful to fall out with your name because it is taken from holy writi would have you to know you was called after greatuncle matthew ap madoc ap meredith esquire of llanwysthin in montgomeryshire justice of the quorum and crusty ruttleorum a gentleman of great worth and property descended in a strait line by the female side from llewellyn prince of wales  this genealogical anecdote seemed to make some impression upon the northbriton who bowed very low to the descendant of llewellyn and observed that he himself had the honour of a scriptural nomination the lady expressing a desire of knowing his address he said he designed himself lieutenant obadiah lismahago and in order to assist her memory he presented her with a slip of paper inscribed with these three words which she repeated with great emphasis declaring it was one of the most noble and sonorous names she had ever heard he observed that obadiah was an adventitious appellation derived from his greatgrandfather who had been one of the original covenanters but lismahago was the family surname taken from a place in scotland so called helikewise dropped some hints about the antiquity of his pedigree adding with a smile of selfdenial sed genus et proavos et quoe non fecimus ipsi vix ea nostra voco which quotation he explained in deference to the ladies and mrs tabitha did not fail to compliment him on his modesty in waving the merit of his ancestry adding that it was the less necessary to him as he had such a considerable fund of his own she now began to glew herself to his favour with the grossest adulationshe expatiated upon the antiquity and virtues of the scottish nation upon their valour probity learning and politeness she even descended to encomiums on his own personal address his gallantry good sense and eruditionshe appealed to her brother whether the captain was not the very image of our cousin governor griffith she discovered a surprising eagerness to know the particulars of his life and asked a thousand questions concerning his atchievements in war all which mr lismahago answered with a sort of jesuitical reserve affecting a reluctance to satisfy her curiosity on a subject that concerned his own exploits  by dint of her interrogations however we learned that he and ensign murphy had made their escape from the french hospital at montreal and taken to the woods in hope of reaching some english settlement but mistaking their route they fell in with a party of miamis who carried them away in captivity the intention of these indians was to give one of them as an adopted son to a venerable sachem who had lost his own in the course of the war and to sacrifice the other according to the custom of the country murphy as being the younger and handsomer of the two was designed to fill the place of the deceased not only as the son of the sachem but as the spouse of a beautiful squaw to whom his predecessor had been betrothed but in passing through the different whigwhams or villages of the miamis poor murphy was so mangled by the women and children who have the privilege of torturing all prisoners in their passage that by the time they arrived at the place of the sachems residence he was rendered altogether unfit for the purposes of marriage it was determined therefore in the assembly of the warriors that ensign murphy should be brought to the stake and that the lady should be given to lieutenant lismahago who had likewise received his share of torments though they had not produced emasculationa joint of one finger had been cut or rather sawed off with a rusty knife one of his great toes was crushed into a mash betwixt two stones some of his teeth were drawn or dug out with a crooked nail splintered reeds had been thrust up his nostrils and other tender parts and the calves of his legs had been blown up with mines of gunpowder dug in the flesh with the sharp point of the tomahawk  the indians themselves allowed that murphy died with great heroism singing as his death song the drimmendoo in concert with mr lismahago who was present at the solemnity after the warriors and the matrons had made a hearty meal upon the muscular flesh which they pared from the victim and had applied a great variety of tortures which he bore without flinching an old lady with a sharp knife scooped out one of his eyes and put a burning coal in the socket the pain of this operation was so exquisite that he could not help bellowing upon which the audience raised a shout of exultation and one of the warriors stealing behind him gave him the coup de grace with a hatchet  lismahagos bride the squaw squinkinacoosta distinguished herself on this occasionshe shewed a great superiority of genius in the tortures which she contrived and executed with her own handsshe vied with the stoutest warrior in eating the flesh of the sacrifice and after all the other females were fuddled with dramdrinking she was not so intoxicated but that she was able to play the game of the platter with the conjuring sachem and afterwards go through the ceremony of her own wedding which was consummated that same evening the captain had lived very happily with this accomplished squaw for two years during which she bore him a son who is now the representative of his mothers tribe but at length to his unspeakable grief she had died of a fever occasioned by eating too much raw bear which they had killed in a hunting excursion  by this time mr lismahago was elected sachem acknowledged first warrior of the badger tribe and dignified with the name or epithet of occacanastaogarora which signifies nimble as a weasel but all these advantages and honours he was obliged to resign in consequence of being exchanged for the orator of the community who had been taken prisoner by the indians that were in alliance with the english at the peace he had sold out upon half pay and was returned to britain with a view to pass the rest of his life in his own country where he hoped to find some retreat where his slender finances would afford him a decent subsistence such are the outlines of mr lismahagos history to which tabitha did seriously incline her earindeed she seemed to be taken with the same charms that captivated the heart of desdemona who loved the moor for the dangers he had past  the description of poor murphys sufferings which threw my sister liddy into a swoon extracted some sighs from the breast of mrs tabby when she understood he had been rendered unfit for marriage she began to spit and ejaculated jesus what cruel barbarians and she made wry faces at the ladys nuptial repast but she was eagerly curious to know the particulars of her marriagedress whether she wore highbreasted stays or bodice a robe of silk or velvet and laces of mechlin or minionetteshe supposed as they were connected with the french she used rouge and had her hair dressed in the parisian fashion the captain would have declined giving a catagorical explanation of all these particulars observing in general that the indians were too tenacious of their own customs to adopt the modes of any nation whatsoever he said moreover that neither the simplicity of their manners nor the commerce of their country would admit of those articles of luxury which are deemed magnificence in europe and that they were too virtuous and sensible to encourage the introduction of any fashion which might help to render them corrupt and effeminate  these observations served only to inflame her desire of knowing the particulars about which she had enquired and with all his evasion he could not help discovering the following circumstancesthat his princess had neither shoes stockings shift nor any kind of linenthat her bridal dress consisted of a petticoat of red bays and a fringed blanket fastened about her shoulders with a copper skewer but of ornaments she had great plentyher hair was curiously plaited and interwoven with bobbins of human boneone eyelid was painted green and the other yellow the cheeks were blue the lips white the teeth red and there was a black list drawn down the middle of the forehead as far as the tip of the nosea couple of gaudy parrots feathers were stuck through the division of the nostrilsthere was a blue stone set in the chin her earrings consisted of two pieces of hickery of the size and shape of drumsticksher arms and legs were adorned with bracelets of wampumher breast glittered with numerous strings of glass beadsshe wore a curious pouch or pocket of woven grass elegantly painted with various coloursabout her neck was hung the fresh scalp of a mohawk warrior whom her deceased lover had lately slain in battleand finally she was anointed from head to foot with bears grease which sent forth a most agreeable odour  one would imagine that these paraphernalia would not have been much admired by a modern fine lady but mrs tabitha was resolved to approve of all the captains connexionsshe wished indeed the squaw had been better provided with linen but she owned there was much taste and fancy in her ornaments she made no doubt therefore that madam squinkinacoosta was a young lady of good sense and rare accomplishments and a good christian at bottom then she asked whether his consort had been high church or lowchurch presbyterian or anabaptist or had been favoured with any glimmering of the new light of the gospel when he confessed that she and her whole nation were utter strangers to the christian faith she gazed at him with signs of astonishment and humphry clinker who chanced to be in the room uttered a hollow groan  after some pause in the name of god captain lismahago cried she what religion do they profess as to religion madam answered the lieutenant it is among those indians a matter of great simplicitythey never heard of any alliance between church and statethey in general worship two contending principles one the fountain of all good the other the source of all evil the common people there as in other countries run into the absurdities of superstition but sensible men pay adoration to a supreme being who created and sustains the universe o what pity exclaimed the pious tabby that some holy man has not been inspired to go and convert these poor heathens  the lieutenant told her that while he resided among them two french missionaries arrived in order to convert them to the catholic religion but when they talked of mysteries and revelations which they could neither explain nor authenticate and called in the evidence of miracles which they believed upon hearsay when they taught that the supreme creator of heaven and earth had allowed his only son his own equal in power and glory to enter the bowels of a woman to be born as a human creature to be insulted flagellated and even executed as a malefactor when they pretended to create god himself to swallow digest revive and multiply him ad infinitum by the help of a little flour and water the indians were shocked at the impiety of their presumptionthey were examined by the assembly of the sachems who desired them to prove the divinity of their mission by some miraclethey answered that it was not in their powerif you were really sent by heaven for our conversion said one of the sachems you would certainly have some supernatural endowments at least you would have the gift of tongues in order to explain your doctrine to the different nations among which you are employed but you are so ignorant of our language that you cannot express yourselves even on the most trifling subjects in a word the assembly were convinced of their being cheats and even suspected them of being spies they ordered them a bag of indian corn apiece and appointed a guide to conduct them to the frontiers but the missionaries having more zeal than discretion refused to quit the vineyardthey persisted in saying mass in preaching baptizing and squabbling with the conjurers or priests of the country till they had thrown the whole community into confusionthen the assembly proceeded to try them as impious impostors who represented the almighty as a trifling weak capricious being and pretended to make unmake and reproduce him at pleasure they were therefore convicted of blasphemy and sedition and condemned to the stale where they died singing salve regina in a rapture of joy for the crown of martyrdom which they had thus obtained  in the course of this conversation lieutenant lismahago dropt some hints by which it appeared he himself was a freethinker our aunt seemed to be startled at certain sarcasms he threw out against the creed of saint athanasiushe dwelt much upon the words reason philosophy and contradiction in termshe bid defiance to the eternity of hellfire and even threw such squibs at the immortality of the soul as singed a little the whiskers of mrs tabithas faith for by this time she began to look upon lismahago as a prodigy of learning and sagacityin short he could be no longer insensible to the advances she made towards his affection and although there was something repulsive in his nature he overcame it so far as to make some return to her civilitiesperhaps he thought it would be no bad scheme in a superannuated lieutenant on halfpay to effect a conjunction with an old maid who in all probability had fortune enough to keep him easy and comfortable in the fagend of his daysan ogling correspondence forthwith commenced between this amiable pair of originalshe began to sweeten the natural acidity of his discourse with the treacle of compliment and commendationhe from time to time offered her snuff of which he himself took great quantities and even made her a present of a purse of silk grass woven by the hands of the amiable squinkinacoosta who had used it as a shotpouch in her hunting expeditions  from doncaster northwards all the windows of all the inns are scrawled with doggeral rhimes in abuse of the scotch nation and what surprised me very much i did not perceive one line written in the way of recriminationcurious to hear what lismahago would say on this subject i pointed out to him a very scurrilous epigram against his countrymen which was engraved on one of the windows of the parlour where we sathe read it with the most starched composure and when i asked his opinion of the poetry it is vara terse and vara poignant said he but with the help of a wat dishclout it might be rendered more clear and parspicuousi marvel much that some modern wit has not published a collection of these essays under the title of the glaziers triumph over sawney the scotim persuaded it would be a vara agreeable offering to the patriots of london and westminster when i expressed some surprize that the natives of scotland who travel this way had not broke all the windows upon the road with submission replied the lieutenant that were but shallow policyit would only serve to make the satire more cutting and severe and i think it is much better to let it stand in the window than have it presented in the reckoning  my uncles jaws began to quiver with indignationhe said the scribblers of such infamous stuff deserved to be scourged at the carts tail for disgracing their country with such monuments of malice and stupiditythese vermin said he do not consider that they are affording their fellow subjects whom they abuse continual matter of selfgratulation as well as the means of executing the most manly vengeance that can be taken for such low illiberal attacks for my part i admire the philosophic forbearance of the scots as much as i despise the insolence of those wretched libellers which is akin to the arrogance of the village cock who never crows but upon his own dunghill the captain with an affectation of candour observed that men of illiberal minds were produced in every soil that in supposing those were the sentiments of the english in general he should pay too great a compliment to is own country which was not of consequence enough to attract the envy of such a flourishing and powerful people  mrs tabby broke forth again in praise of his moderation and declared that scotland was the soil which produced every virtue under heaven when lismahago took his leave for the night she asked her brother if the captain was not the prettiest gentleman he had ever seen and whether there was not something wonderfully engaging in his aspectmr bramble having eyed her sometime in silence sister said he the lieutenant is for aught i know an honest man and a good officerhe has a considerable share of understanding and a title to more encouragement than he seems to have met with in life but i cannot with a safe conscience affirm that he is the prettiest gentleman i ever saw neither can i descern any engaging charm in his countenance which i vow to god is on the contrary very hardfavoured and forbidding  i have endeavoured to ingratiate myself with this northbriton who is really a curiosity but he has been very shy of my conversation ever since i laughed at his asserting that the english tongue was spoke with more propriety at edinburgh than at london looking at me with a double squeeze of souring in his aspect if the old definition be true said he that risibility is the distinguishing characteristic of a rational creature the english are the most distinguished for rationality of any people i ever knew i owned that the english were easily struck with any thing that appeared ludicrous and apt to laugh accordingly but it did not follow that because they were more given to laughter they had more rationality than their neighbours i said such an inference would be an injury to the scots who were by no means defective in rationality though generally supposed little subject to the impressions of humour  the captain answered that this supposition must have been deduced either from their conversation or their compositions of which the english could not possibly judge with precision as they did not understand the dialect used by the scots in common discourse as well as in their works of humour when i desired to know what those works of humour were he mentioned a considerable number of pieces which he insisted were equal in point of humour to any thing extant in any language dead or livinghe in particular recommended a collection of detached poems in two small volumes intituled the evergreen and the works of allan ramsay which i intend to provide myself with at edinburghhe observed that a northbriton is seen to a disadvantage in an english company because he speaks in a dialect that they cant relish and in a phraseology which they dont understandhe therefore finds himself under a restraint which is a great enemy to wit and humourthese are faculties which never appear in full lustre but when the mind is perfectly at ease and as an excellent writer says enjoys her elbowroom  he proceeded to explain his assertion that the english language was spoken with greater propriety at edinburgh than in london he said what we generally called the scottish dialect was in fact true genuine old english with a mixture of some french terms and idioms adopted in a long intercourse betwixt the french and scotch nations that the modern english from affectation and false refinement had weakened and even corrupted their language by throwing out the guttural sounds altering the pronunciation and the quantity and disusing many words and terms of great significance in consequence of these innovations the works of our best poets such as chaucer spenser and even shakespeare were become in many parts unintelligible to the natives of south britain whereas the scots who retain the antient language understand them without the help of a glossary for instance said he how have your commentators been puzzled by the following expression in the tempesthes gentle and not fearful as if it was a paralogism to say that being gentle he must of course be courageous but the truth is one of the original meanings if not the sole meaning of that word was noble highminded and to this day a scotch woman in the situation of the young lady in the tempest would express herself nearly in the same termsdont provoke him for being gentle that is highspirited he wont tamely bear an insult spenser in the very first stanza of his fairy queen says     a gentle knight was pricking on the plain    which knight far from being tame and fearful was so stout that    nothing did he dread but ever was ydrad  to prove that we had impaired the energy of our language by false refinement he mentioned the following words which though widely different in signification are pronounced exactly in the same manner wright write right rite but among the scots these words are as different in pronunciation as they are in meaning and orthography and this is the case with many others which he mentioned by way of illustrationhe moreover took notice that we had for what reason he could never learn altered the sound of our vowels from that which is retained by all the nations in europe an alteration which rendered the language extremely difficult to foreigners and made it almost impracticable to lay down general rules for orthography and pronunciation besides the vowels were no longer simple sounds in the mouth of an englishman who pronounced both i and u as dipthongs finally he affirmed that we mumbled our speech with our lips and teeth and ran the words together without pause or distinction in such a manner that a foreigner though he understood english tolerably well was often obliged to have recourse to a scotchman to explain what a native of england had said in his own language  the truth of this remark was confirmed by mr bramble from his own experience but he accounted for it on another principle he said the same observation would hold in all languages that a swiss talking french was more easily understood than a parisian by a foreigner who had not made himself master of the language because every language had its peculiar recitative and it would always require more pains attention and practice to acquire both the words and the music than to learn the words only and yet no body would deny that the one was imperfect without the other he therefore apprehended that the scotchman and the swiss were better understood by learners because they spoke the words only without the music which they could not rehearse one would imagine this check might have damped the north briton but it served only to agitate his humour for disputationhe said if every nation had its own recitative or music the scots had theirs and the scotchman who had not yet acquired the cadence of the english would naturally use his own in speaking their language therefore if he was better understood than the native his recitative must be more intelligible than that of the english of consequence the dialect of the scots had an advantage over that of their fellowsubjects and this was another strong presumption that the modern english had corrupted their language in the article of pronunciation  the lieutenant was by this time become so polemical that every time he opened his mouth out flew a paradox which he maintained with all the enthusiasm of altercation but all his paradoxes favoured strong of a partiality for his own country he undertook to prove that poverty was a blessing to a nation that oatmeal was preferable to wheatflour and that the worship of cloacina in temples which admitted both sexes and every rank of votaries promiscuously was a filthy species of idolatry that outraged every idea of delicacy and decorum i did not so much wonder at his broaching these doctrines as at the arguments equally whimsical and ingenious which he adduced in support of them  in fine lieutenant lismahago is a curiosity which i have not yet sufficiently perused and therefore i shall be sorry when we lose his company though god knows there is nothing very amiable in his manner or dispositionas he goes directly to the southwest division of scotland and we proceed in the road to berwick we shall part tomorrow at a place called feltonbridge and i dare say this separation will be very grievous to our aunt mrs tabitha unless she has received some flattering assurance of his meeting her again if i fail in my purpose of entertaining you with these unimportant occurrences they will at least serve as exercises of patience for which you are indebted to   yours always j melford morpeth july        to dr lewis  dear doctor  i have now reached the northern extremity of england and see close to my chamberwindow the tweed gliding through the arches of that bridge which connects this suburb to the town of berwickyorkshire you have seen and therefore i shall say nothing of that opulent province the city of durham appears like a confused heap of stones and brick accumulated so as to cover a mountain round which a river winds its brawling course the streets are generally narrow dark and unpleasant and many of them almost impassible in consequence of their declivity the cathedral is a huge gloomy pile but the clergy are well lodged the bishop lives in a princely mannerthe golden prebends keep plentiful tablesand i am told there is some good sociable company in the place but the country when viewed from the top of gatesheadfell which extends to newcastle exhibits the highest scene of cultivation that ever i beheld as for newcastle it lies mostly in a bottom on the banks of the tyne and makes an appearance still more disagreeable than that of durham but it is rendered populous and rich by industry and commerce and the country lying on both sides the river above the town yields a delightful prospect of agriculture and plantation morpeth and alnwick are neat pretty towns and this last is famous for the castle which has belonged so many ages to the noble house of piercy earls of northumberlandit is doubtless a large edifice containing a great number of apartments and stands in a commanding situation but the strength of it seems to have consisted not so much in its site or the manner in which it is fortified as in the valour of its defendants  our adventures since we left scarborough are scarce worth reciting and yet i must make you acquainted with my sister tabbys progress in husbandhunting after her disappointments at bath and london she had actually begun to practise upon a certain adventurer who was in fact a highwayman by profession but he had been used to snares much more dangerous than any she could lay and escaped accordingly then she opened her batteries upon an old weatherbeaten scotch lieutenant called lismahago who joined us at durham and is i think one of the most singular personages i ever encounteredhis manner is as harsh as his countenance but his peculiar turn of thinking and his pack of knowledge made up of the remnants of rarities rendered his conversation desirable in spite of his pedantry and ungracious address i have often met with a crabapple in a hedge which i have been tempted to eat for its flavour even while i was disgusted by its austerity the spirit of contradiction is naturally so strong in lismahago that i believe in my conscience he has rummaged and read and studied with indefatigable attention in order to qualify himself to refute established maxims and thus raise trophies for the gratification of polemical pridesuch is the asperity of his selfconceit that he will not even acquiesce in a transient compliment made to his own individual in particular or to his country in general  when i observed that he must have read a vast number of books to be able to discourse on such a variety of subjects he declared he had read little or nothing and asked how he should find books among the woods of america where he had spent the greatest part of his life my nephew remarking that the scots in general were famous for their learning he denied the imputation and defied him to prove it from their worksthe scots said he have a slight tincture of letters with which they make a parade among people who are more illiterate than themselves but they may be said to float on the surface of science and they have made very small advances in the useful arts at least cried tabby all the world allows that the scots behaved gloriously in fighting and conquering the savages of america i can assure you madam you have been misinformed replied the lieutenant in that continent the scots did nothing more than their duty nor was there one corps in his majestys service that distinguished itself more than anotherthose who affected to extol the scots for superior merit were no friends to that nation  though he himself made free with his countrymen he would not suffer any other person to glance a sarcasm at them with impunity one of the company chancing to mention lord bs inglorious peace the lieutenant immediately took up the cudgels in his lordships favour and argued very strenuously to prove that it was the most honourable and advantageous peace that england had ever made since the foundation of the monarchynay between friends he offered such reasons on this subject that i was really confounded if not convincedhe would not allow that the scots abounded above their proportion in the army and navy of greatbritain or that the english had any reason to say his countrymen had met with extraordinary encouragement in the service when a south and northbriton said he are competitors for a place or commission which is in the disposal of an english minister or an english general it would be absurd to suppose that the preference will not be given to the native of england who has so many advantages over his rivalfirst and foremost he has in his favour that laudable partiality which mr addison says never fails to cleave to the heart of an englishman secondly he has more powerful connexions and a greater share of parliamentary interest by which those contests are generally decided and lastly he has a greater command of money to smooth the way to his success for my own part said he i know no scotch officer who has risen in the army above the rank of a subaltern without purchasing every degree of preferment either with money or recruits but i know many gentlemen of that country who for want of money and interest have grown grey in the rank of lieutenants whereas very few instances of this illfortune are to be found among the natives of southbritainnot that i would insinuate that my countrymen have the least reason to complain preferment in the service like success in any other branch of traffic will naturally favour those who have the greatest stock of cash and credit merit and capacity being supposed equal on all sides  but the most hardy of all this originals positions were these that commerce would sooner or later prove the ruin of every nation where it flourishes to any extentthat the parliament was the rotten part of the british constitutionthat the liberty of the press was a national eviland that the boasted institution of juries as managed in england was productive of shameful perjury and flagrant injustice he observed that traffick was an enemy to all the liberal passions of the soul founded on the thirst of lucre a sordid disposition to take advantage of the necessities of our fellow creatureshe affirmed the nature of commerce was such that it could not be fixed or perpetuated but having flowed to a certain height would immediately begin to ebb and so continue till the channels should be left almost dry but there was no instance of the tides rising a second time to any considerable influx in the same nation mean while the sudden affluence occasioned by trade forced open all the sluices of luxury and overflowed the land with every species of profligacy and corruption a total pravity of manners would ensue and this must be attended with bankruptcy and ruin he observed of the parliament that the practice of buying boroughs and canvassing for votes was an avowed system of venality already established on the ruins of principle integrity faith and good order in consequence of which the elected and the elector and in short the whole body of the people were equally and universally contaminated and corrupted he affirmed that of a parliament thus constituted the crown would always have influence enough to secure a great majority in its dependence from the great number of posts places and pensions it had to bestow that such a parliament would as it had already done lengthen the term of its sitting and authority whenever the prince should think it for his interest to continue the representatives for without doubt they had the same right to protect their authority ad infinitum as they had to extend it from three to seven yearswith a parliament therefore dependent upon the crown devoted to the prince and supported by a standing army garbled and modelled for the purpose any king of england may and probably some ambitious sovereign will totally overthrow all the bulwarks of the constitution for it is not to be supposed that a prince of high spirit will tamely submit to be thwarted in all his measures abused and insulted by a populace of unbridled ferocity when he has it in his power to crush all opposition under his feet with the concurrence of the legislature he said he should always consider the liberty of the press as a national evil while it enabled the vilest reptile to soil the lustre of the most shining merit and furnished the most infamous incendiary with the means of disturbing the peace and destroying the good order of the community he owned however that under due restrictions it would be a valuable privilege but affirmed that at present there was no law in england sufficient to restrain it within proper bounds  with respect to juries he expressed himself to this effectjuries are generally composed of illiterate plebeians apt to be mistaken easily misled and open to sinister influence for if either of the parties to be tried can gain over one of the twelve jurors he has secured the verdict in his favour the juryman thus brought over will in despight of all evidence and conviction generally hold out till his fellows are fatigued and harassed and starved into concurrence in which case the verdict is unjust and the jurors are all perjured but cases will often occur when the jurors are really divided in opinion and each side is convinced in opposition to the other but no verdict will be received unless they are unanimous and they are all bound not only in conscience but by oath to judge and declare according to their convictionwhat then will be the consequencethey must either starve in company or one side must sacrifice their conscience to their convenience and join in a verdict which they believe to be false this absurdity is avoided in sweden where a bare majority is sufficient and in scotland where two thirds of the jury are required to concur in the verdict  you must not imagine that all these deductions were made on his part without contradictions on minenothe truth is i found myself piqued in point of honour at his pretending to be so much wiser than his neighboursi questioned all his assertions started innumerable objections argued and wrangled with uncommon perseverance and grew very warm and even violent in the debatesometimes he was puzzled and once or twice i think fairly refuted but from those falls he rose again like antaeus with redoubled vigour till at length i was tired exhausted and really did not know how to proceed when luckily he dropped a hint by which he discovered he had been bred to the law a confession which enabled me to retire from the dispute with a good grace as it could not be supposed that a man like me who had been bred to nothing should be able to cope with a veteran in his own profession i believe however that i shall for some time continue to chew the cud of reflection upon many observations which this original discharged  whether our sister tabby was really struck with his conversation or is resolved to throw at every thing she meets in the shape of a man till she can fasten the matrimonial noose certain it is she has taken desperate strides towards the affection of lismahago who cannot be said to have met her half way though he does not seem altogether insensible to her civilitiesshe insinuated more than once how happy we should be to have his company through that part of scotland which we proposed to visit till at length he plainly told us that his road was totally different from that which we intended to take that for his part his company would be of very little service to us in our progress as he was utterly unacquainted with the country which he had left in his early youth consequently he could neither direct us in our enquiries nor introduce us to any family of distinction he said he was stimulated by an irresistible impulse to revisit the paternus lar or patria domus though he expected little satisfaction inasmuch as he understood that his nephew the present possessor was but ill qualified to support the honour of the familyhe assured us however as we design to return by the west road that he will watch our motions and endeavour to pay his respects to us at dumfriesaccordingly he took his leave of us at a place half way betwixt morpeth and alnwick and pranced away in great state mounted on a tall meagre rawboned shambling grey gelding without eer a tooth in his head the very counterpart of the rider and indeed the appearance of the two was so picturesque that i would give twenty guineas to have them tolerably presented on canvas  northumberland is a fine county extending to the tweed which is a pleasant pastoral stream but you will be surprised when i tell you that the english side of that river is neither so well cultivated nor so populous as the otherthe farms are thinly scattered the lands uninclosed and scarce a gentlemans seat is to be seen in some miles from the tweed whereas the scots are advanced in crowds to the very brink of the river so that you may reckon above thirty good houses in the compass of a few miles belonging to proprietors whose ancestors had fortified castles in the same situations a circumstance that shews what dangerous neighbours the scots must have formerly been to the northern counties of england  our domestic oeconomy continues on the old footingmy sister tabby still adheres to methodism and had the benefit of a sermon at wesleys meeting in newcastle but i believe the passion of love has in some measure abated the fervour of devotion both in her and her woman mrs jenkins about whose good graces there has been a violent contest betwixt my nephews valet mr dutton and my man humphry clinkerjery has been obliged to interpose his authority to keep the peace and to him i have left the discussion of that important affair which had like to have kindled the flames of discord in the family of  yours always matt bramble tweedmouth july        to sir watkin phillips bart at oxon  dear wat  in my two last you had so much of lismahago that i suppose you are glad he is gone off the stage for the presenti must now descend to domestic occurrenceslove it seems is resolved to assert his dominion over all the females of our familyafter having practised upon poor liddys heart and played strange vagaries with our aunt mrs tabitha he began to run riot in the affections of her woman mrs winifred jenkins whom i have had occasion to mention more than once in the course of our memoirs nature intended jenkins for something very different from the character of her mistress yet custom and habit have effected a wonderful resemblance betwixt them in many particulars win to be sure is much younger and more agreeable in her person she is likewise tenderhearted and benevolent qualities for which her mistress is by no means remarkable no more than she is for being of a timorous disposition and much subject to fits of the mother which are the infirmities of wins constitution but then she seems to have adopted mrs tabbys manner with her cast cloathsshe dresses and endeavours to look like her mistress although her own looks are much more engagingshe enters into her scheme of oeconomy learns her phrases repeats her remarks imitates her stile in scolding the inferior servants and finally subscribes implicitly to her system of devotionthis indeed she found the more agreeable as it was in a great measure introduced and confirmed by the ministry of clinker with whose personal merit she seems to have been struck ever since he exhibited the pattern of his naked skin at marlborough  nevertheless though humphry had this double hank upon her inclinations and exerted all his power to maintain the conquest he had made he found it impossible to guard it on the side of vanity where poor win was as frail as any female in the kingdom in short my rascal dutton professed himself her admirer and by dint of his outlandish qualifications threw his rival clinker out of the saddle of her heart humphry may be compared to an english pudding composed of good wholesome flour and suet and dutton to a syllabub or iced froth which though agreeable to the taste has nothing solid or substantial the traitor not only dazzled her with his secondhand finery but he fawned and flattered and cringedhe taught her to take rappee and presented her with a snuffbox of papier machehe supplied her with a powder for her teethhe mended her complexion and he dressed her hair in the paris fashionhe undertook to be her french master and her dancingmaster as well as friseur and thus imperceptibly wound himself into her good graces clinker perceived the progress he had made and repined in secrethe attempted to open her eyes in the way of exhortation and finding it produced no effect had recourse to prayer at newcastle while he attended mrs tabby to the methodist meeting his rival accompanied mrs jenkins to the play he was dressed in a silk coat made at paris for his former master with a tawdry waistcoat of tarnished brocade he wore his hair in a great bag with a huge solitaire and a long sword dangled from his thigh the lady was all of a flutter with faded lutestring washed gauze and ribbons three times refreshed but she was most remarkable for the frisure of her head which rose like a pyramid seven inches above the scalp and her face was primed and patched from the chin up to the eyes nay the gallant himself had spared neither red nor white in improving the nature of his own complexion in this attire they walked together through the high street to the theatre and as they passed for players ready dressed for acting they reached it unmolested but as it was still light when they returned and by that time the people had got information of their real character and condition they hissed and hooted all the way and mrs jenkins was all bespattered with dirt as well as insulted with the opprobrious name of painted jezabel so that her fright and mortification threw her into an hysteric fit the moment she came home  clinker was so incensed at dutton whom he considered as the cause of her disgrace that he upbraided him severely for having turned the poor womans brain the other affected to treat him with contempt and mistaking his forbearance for want of courage threatened to horsewhip him into good manners humphry then came to me humbly begging i would give him leave to chastise my servant for his insolencehe has challenged me to fight him at swords point said he but i might as well challenge him to make a horseshoe or a plough iron for i know no more of the one than he does of the otherbesides it doth not become servants to use those weapons or to claim the privilege of gentlemen to kill one another when they fall out moreover i would not have his blood upon my conscience for ten thousand times the profit or satisfaction i should get by his death but if your honour wont be angry ill engage to gee en a good drubbing that may hap will do en service and ill take care it shall do en no harm i said i had no objection to what he proposed provided he could manage matters so as not to be found the aggressor in case dutton should prosecute him for an assault and battery  thus licensed he retired and that same evening easily provoked his rival to strike the first blow which clinker returned with such interest that he was obliged to call for quarter declaring at the same time that he would exact severe and bloody satisfaction the moment we should pass the border when he could run him through the body without fear of the consequencethis scene passed in presence of lieutenant lismahago who encouraged clinker to hazard a thrust of cold iron with his antagonist cold iron cried humphry i shall never use against the life of any human creature but i am so far from being afraid of his cold iron that i shall use nothing in my defence but a good cudgel which shall always be at his service in the mean time the fair cause of this contest mrs winifred jenkins seemed overwhelmed with affliction and mr clinker acted much on the reserve though he did not presume to find fault with her conduct  the dispute between the two rivals was soon brought to a very unexpected issue among our fellowlodgers at berwick was a couple from london bound to edinburgh on the voyage of matrimony the female was the daughter and heiress of a pawnbroker deceased who had given her guardians the slip and put herself under the tuition of a tall hibernian who had conducted her thus far in quest of a clergyman to unite them in marriage without the formalities required by the law of england i know not how the lover had behaved on the road so as to decline in the favour of his inamorata but in all probability dutton perceived a coldness on her side which encouraged him to whisper it was a pity she should have cast affections upon a taylor which he affirmed the irishman to be this discovery completed her disgust of which my man taking the advantage began to recommend himself to her good graces and the smoothtongued rascal found no difficulty to insinuate himself into the place of her heart from which the other had been discardedtheir resolution was immediately taken in the morning before day while poor teague lay snoring abed his indefatigable rival ordered a postchaise and set out with the lady for coldstream a few miles up the tweed where there was a parson who dealt in this branch of commerce and there they were noosed before the irishman ever dreamt of the matter but when he got up at six oclock and found the bird was flown he made such a noise as alarmed the whole house one of the first persons he encountered was the postilion returned from coldstream where he had been witness to the marriage and over and above an handsome gratuity had received a brides favour which he now wore in his capwhen the forsaken lover understood they were actually married and set out for london and that dutton had discovered to the lady that he the hibernian was a taylor he had like to have run distracted he tore the ribbon from the fellows cap and beat it about his ears he swore he would pursue him to the gates of hell and ordered a postchaise and four to be got ready as soon as possible but recollecting that his finances would not admit of this way of travelling he was obliged to countermand this order  for my part i knew nothing at all of what had happened till the postilion brought me the keys of my trunk and portmanteau which he had received from dutton who sent me his respects hoping i would excuse him for his abrupt departure as it was a step upon which his fortune depended before i had time to make my uncle acquainted with this event the irishman burst into my chamber without any introduction exclaimingby my soul your sarvant has robbed me of five thousand pounds and ill have satisfaction if i should be hanged tomorrowwhen i asked him who he was my name said he is master macloughlin but it should be leighlin oneale for i am come from tirowen the great and so i am as good a gentleman as any in ireland and that rogue your sarvant said i was a taylor which was as big a lie as if he had called me the popeim a man of fortune and have spent all i had and so being in distress mr coshgrave the fashioner in shuffolkstreet tuck me out and made me his own private shecretary by the same token i was the last he bailed for his friends obliged him to tie himself up that he would bail no more above ten pounds for why becaase as how he could not refuse any body that asked and therefore in time would have robbed himself of his whole fortune and if he had lived long at that rate must have died bankrupt very soon and so i made my addresses to miss skinner a young lady of five thousand pounds fortune who agreed to take me for better nor worse and to be sure this day would have put me in possession if it had not been for that rogue your sarvant who came like a tief and stole away my property and made her believe i was a taylor and that she was going to marry the ninth part of a man but the devil burn my soul if ever i catch him on the mountains of tulloghobegly if i dont shew him that im nine times as good a man as he or eer a bug of his country  when he had rung out his first alarm i told him i was sorry he had allowed himself to be so jockied but it was no business of mine and that the fellow who robbed him of his bride had likewise robbed me of my servantdidnt i tell you then cried he that rogue was his true christian nameoh if i had but one fair trust with him upon the sod id give him lave to brag all the rest of his life  my uncle hearing the noise came in and being informed of this adventure began to comfort mr oneale for the ladys elopement observing that he seemed to have had a lucky escape that it was better she should elope before than after marriagethe hibernian was of a very different opinion he said if he had been once married she might have eloped as soon as she pleased he would have taken care that she should not have carried her fortune along with herah said he shes a judas iscariot and has betrayed me with a kiss and like judas she carried the bag and has not left me money enough to bear my expences back to london and so im come to this pass and the rogue that was the occasion of it has left you without a sarvant you may put me in his place and by jasus it is the best thing you can doi begged to be excused declaring i could put up with any inconvenience rather than treat as a footman the descendant of tirowen the great i advised him to return to his friend mr cosgrave and take his passage from newcastle by sea towards which i made him a small present and he retired seemingly resigned to his evil fortune i have taken upon trial a scotchman called archy malpin an old soldier whose last master a colonel lately died at berwick the fellow is old and withered but he has been recommended to me for his fidelity by mrs humphreys a very good sort of a woman who keeps the inn at tweedmouth and is much respected by all the travellers on this road  clinker without doubt thinks himself happy in the removal of a dangerous rival and he is too good a christian to repine at duttons success even mrs jenkins will have reason to congratulate herself upon this event when she cooly reflects upon the matter for howsoever she was forced from her poise for a season by snares laid for her vanity humphry is certainly the northstar to which the needle of her affection would have pointed at the long run at present the same vanity is exceedingly mortified upon finding herself abandoned by her new admirer in favour of another inamorata she received the news with a violent burst of laughter which soon brought on a fit of crying and this gave the finishing blow to the patience of her mistress which had held out beyond all expectation she now opened all those floodgates of reprehension which had been shut so long she not only reproached her with her levity and indiscretion but attacked her on the score of religion declaring roundly that she was in a state of apostacy and reprobation and finally threatened to send her a packing at this extremity of the kingdom all the family interceded for poor winifred not even excepting her slighted swain mr clinker who on his knees implored and obtained her pardon  there was however another consideration that gave mrs tabitha some disturbance at newcastle the servants had been informed by some wag that there was nothing to eat in scotland but oatmeal and sheepsheads and lieutenant lismahago being consulted what he said served rather to confirm than to refute the report our aunt being apprised of this circumstance very gravely advised her brother to provide a sumpter horse with store of hams tongues bread biscuit and other articles for our subsistence in the course of our peregrination and mr bramble as gravely replied that he would take the hint into consideration but finding no such provision was made she now revived the proposal observing that there was a tolerable market at berwick where we might be supplied and that my mans horse would serve as a beast of burthenthe squire shrugging his shoulders eyed her askance with a look of ineffable contempt and after some pause sister said he i can hardly persuade myself you are serious she was so little acquainted with the geography of the island that she imagined we could not go to scotland but by sea and after we had passed through the town of berwick when he told her we were upon scottish ground she could hardly believe the assertionif the truth must be told the south britons in general are woefully ignorant in this particular what between want of curiosity and traditional sarcasms the effect of ancient animosity the people at the other end of the island know as little of scotland as of japan  if i had never been in wales i should have been more struck with the manifest difference in appearance betwixt the peasants and commonalty on different sides of the tweed the boors of northumberland are lusty fellows fresh complexioned cleanly and well cloathed but the labourers in scotland are generally lank lean hardfeatured sallow soiled and shabby and their little pinched blue caps have a beggarly effect the cattle are much in the same stile with their drivers meagre stunted and ill equipt when i talked to my uncle on this subject he said though all the scottish hinds would not bear to be compared with those of the rich counties of south britain they would stand very well in competition with the peasants of france italy and savoynot to mention the mountaineers of wales and the redshanks of ireland  we entered scotland by a frightful moor of sixteen miles which promises very little for the interior parts of the kingdom but the prospect mended as we advanced passing through dunbar which is a neat little town situated on the seaside we lay at a country inn where our entertainment far exceeded our expectation but for this we cannot give the scots credit as the landlord is a native of england yesterday we dined at haddington which has been a place of some consideration but is now gone to decay and in the evening arrived at this metropolis of which i can say very little it is very romantic from its situation on the declivity of a hill having a fortified castle at the top and a royal palace at the bottom the first thing that strikes the nose of a stranger shall be nameless but what first strikes the eye is the unconscionable height of the houses which generally rise to five six seven and eight stories and in some places as i am assured to twelve this manner of building attended with numberless inconveniences must have been originally owing to want of room certain it is the town seems to be full of people but their looks their language and their customs are so different from ours that i can hardly believe myself in greatbritain  the inn at which we put up if it may be so called was so filthy and disagreeable in all respects that my uncle began to fret and his gouty symptoms to recurrecollecting however that he had a letter of recommendation to one mr mitchelson a lawyer he sent it by his servant with a compliment importing that we would wait upon him next day in person but that gentleman visited us immediately and insisted upon our going to his own house until he could provide lodgings for our accommodation we gladly accepted of his invitation and repaired to his house where we were treated with equal elegance and hospitality to the utter confusion of our aunt whose prejudices though beginning to give way were not yet entirely removed today by the assistance of our friend we are settled in convenient lodgings up four pair of stairs in the highstreet the fourth story being in this city reckoned more genteel than the first the air is in all probability the better but it requires good lungs to breathe it at this distance above the surface of the earthwhile i do remain above it whether higher or lower provided i breathe at all   i shall ever be dear phillips yours j melford july        to dr lewis  dear lewis  that part of scotland contiguous to berwick nature seems to have intended as a barrier between two hostile nations it is a brown desert of considerable extent that produces nothing but heath and fern and what rendered it the more dreary when we passed there was a thick fog that hindered us from seeing above twenty yards from the carriagemy sister began to make wry faces and use her smellingbottle liddy looked blank and mrs jenkins dejected but in a few hours these clouds were dissipated the sea appeared upon our right and on the left the mountains retired a little leaving an agreeable plain betwixt them and the beach but what surprised us all this plain to the extent of several miles was covered with as fine wheat as ever i saw in the most fertile parts of south britainthis plentiful crop is raised in the open field without any inclosure or other manure than the alga marina or seaweed which abounds on this coast a circumstance which shews that the soil and climate are favourable but that agriculture in this country is not yet brought to that perfection which it has attained in england inclosures would not only keep the grounds warm and the several fields distinct but would also protect the crop from the high winds which are so frequent in this part of the island  dunbar is well situated for trade and has a curious bason where ships of small burthen may be perfectly secure but there is little appearance of business in the placefrom thence all the way to edinburgh there is a continual succession of fine seats belonging to noblemen and gentlemen and as each is surrounded by its own parks and plantation they produce a very pleasing effect in a country which lies otherwise open and exposed at dunbar there is a noble park with a lodge belonging to the duke of roxburgh where oliver cromwell had his headquarters when lesley at the head of a scotch army took possession of the mountains in the neighbourhood and hampered him in such a manner that he would have been obliged to embark and get away by sea had not the fanaticism of the enemy forfeited the advantage which they had obtained by their generals conducttheir ministers by exhortation prayer assurance and prophecy instigated them to go down and slay the philistines in gilgal and they quitted their ground accordingly notwithstanding all that lesley could do to restrain the madness of their enthusiasmwhen oliver saw them in motion he exclaimed praised be the lord he hath delivered them into the hands of his servant and ordered his troops to sing a psalm of thanksgiving while they advanced in order to the plain where the scots were routed with great slaughter  in the neighbourhood of haddington there is a gentlemans house in the building of which and the improvements about it he is said to have expended forty thousand pounds but i cannot say i was much pleased with either the architecture or the situation though it has in front a pastoral stream the banks of which are laid out in a very agreeable manner i intended to pay my respects to lord elibank whom i had the honour to know at london many years ago he lives in this part of lothian but was gone to the north on a visityou have often heard me mention this nobleman whom i have long revered for his humanity and universal intelligence over and above the entertainment arising from originality of his characterat musselburgh however i had the goodfortune to drink tea with my old friend mr cardonel and at his house i met with dr c the parson of the parish whose humour and conversation inflamed me with a desire of being better acquainted with his personi am not at all surprised that these scots make their way in every quarter of the globe  this place is but four miles from edinburgh towards which we proceeded along the seashore upon a firm bottom of smooth sand which the tide had left uncovered in its retreatedinburgh from this avenue is not seen to much advantagewe had only an imperfect view of the castle and upper parts of the town which varied incessantly according to the inflexions of the road and exhibited the appearance of detached spires and turrets belonging to some magnificent edifice in ruins the palace of holyrood house stands on the left as you enter the canongatethis is a street continued from hence to the gate called nether bow which is now taken away so that there is no interruption for a long mile from the bottom to the top of the hill on which the castle stands in a most imperial situationconsidering its fine pavement its width and the lofty houses on each side this would be undoubtedly one of the noblest streets in europe if an ugly mass of mean buildings called the luckenbooths had not thrust itself by what accident i know not into the middle of the way like middlerow in holborn the city stands upon two hills and the bottom between them and with all its defects may very well pass for the capital of a moderate kingdomit is full of people and continually resounds with the noise of coaches and other carriages for luxury as well as commerce as far as i can perceive here is no want of provisionsthe beef and mutton are as delicate here as in wales the sea affords plenty of good fish the bread is remarkably fine and the water is excellent though im afraid not in sufficient quantity to answer all the purposes of cleanliness and convenience articles in which it must be allowed our fellowsubjects are a little defectivethe water is brought in leaden pipes from a mountain in the neighbourhood to a cistern on the castlehill from whence it is distributed to public conduits in different parts of the city from these it is carried in barrels on the backs of male and female porters up two three four five six seven and eight pairs of stairs for the use of particular familiesevery story is a complete house occupied by a separate family and the stair being common to them all is generally left in a very filthy condition a man must tread with great circumspection to get safe housed with unpolluted shoesnothing can form a stronger contrast than the difference betwixt the outside and inside of the door for the goodwomen of this metropolis are remarkably nice in the ornaments and propriety of their apartments as if they were resolved to transfer the imputation from the individual to the public you are no stranger to their method of discharging all their impurities from their windows at a certain hour of the night as the custom is in spain portugal and some parts of france and italya practice to which i can by no means be reconciled for notwithstanding all the care that is taken by their scavengers to remove this nuisance every morning by break of day enough still remains to offend the eyes as well as other organs of those whom use has not hardened against all delicacy of sensation  the inhabitants seem insensible to these impressions and are apt to imagine the disgust that we avow is little better than affectation but they ought to have some compassion for strangers who have not been used to this kind of sufferance and consider whether it may not be worth while to take some pains to vindicate themselves from the reproach that on this account they bear among their neighbours as to the surprising height of their houses it is absurd in many respects but in one particular light i cannot view it without horror that is the dreadful situation of all the families above in case the common staircase should be rendered impassable by a fire in the lower storiesin order to prevent the shocking consequences that must attend such an accident it would be a right measure to open doors of communication from one house to another on every story by which the people might fly from such a terrible visitation in all parts of the world we see the force of habit prevailing over all the dictates of convenience and sagacity all the people of business at edinburgh and even the genteel company may be seen standing in crowds every day from one to two in the afternoon in the open street at a place where formerly stood a marketcross which by the bye was a curious piece of gothic architecture still to be seen in lord sommervilles garden in this neighbourhoodi say the people stand in the open street from the force of custom rather than move a few yards to an exchange that stands empty on one side or to the parliamentclose on the other which is a noble square adorned with a fine equestrian statue of king charles iithe company thus assembled are entertained with a variety of tunes played upon a set of bells fixed in a steeple hard byas these bells are welltoned and the musician who has a salary from the city for playing upon them with keys is no bad performer the entertainment is really agreeable and very striking to the ears of a stranger  the public inns of edinburgh are still worse than those of london but by means of a worthy gentleman to whom i was recommended we have got decent lodgings in the house of a widow gentlewoman of the name of lockhart and here i shall stay until i have seen every thing that is remarkable in and about this capital i now begin to feel the good effects of exercisei eat like a farmer sleep from midnight till eight in the morning without interruption and enjoy a constant tide of spirits equally distant from inanition and excess but whatever ebbs or flows my constitution may undergo my heart will still declare that i am  dear lewis your affectionate friend and servant matt bramble edr july        to mrs mary jones at brambletonhall  dear mary  the squire has been so kind as to rap my bit of nonsense under the kiver of his own sheeto mary jones mary jones i have had trials and trembulation god help me i have been a vixen and a griffin these many dayssattin has had power to temp me in the shape of van ditton the young squires wally de shamble but by gods grease he did not purvaili thoft as how there was no arm in going to a play at newcastle with my hair dressed in the parish fashion and as for the trifle of paint he said as how my complexion wanted touch and so i let him put it on with a little spanish owl but a mischievous mob of colliers and such promiscous ribble rabble that could bare no smut but their own attacked us in the street and called me hoar and painted issabel and splashed my close and spoiled me a complete set of blond lace triple ruffles not a pin the worse for the warethey cost me seven good sillings to lady griskins woman at london  when i axed mr clinker what they meant by calling me issabel he put the byebill into my hand and i read of van issabel a painted harlot that vas thrown out of a vindore and the dogs came and licked her blood but i am no harlot and with gods blessing no dog shall have my poor blood to lick marry heaven forbid amen as for ditton after all his courting and his compliment he stole away an irishmans bride and took a french leave of me and his master but i vally not his going a farting but i have had hanger on his accountmistriss scoulded like mad thof i have the comfit that all the family took my part and even mr clinker pleaded for me on his bended knee thof god he knows he had raisins enuff to complain but hes a good sole abounding with christian meekness and one day will meet with his reward  and now dear mary we have got to haddingborrough among the scots who are civil enuff for our money thof i dont speak their lingobut they should not go for to impose upon foreigners for the bills in their houses say they have different easements to let and behold there is nurro geaks in the whole kingdom nor any thing for poor sarvants but a barrel with a pair of tongs thrown across and all the chairs in the family are emptied into this here barrel once aday and at ten oclock at night the whole cargo is flung out of a back windore that looks into some street or lane and the maids calls gardy loo to the passengers which signifies lord have mercy upon you and this is done every night in every house in haddingborrough so you may guess mary jones what a sweet savour comes from such a number of profuming pans but they say it is wholesome and truly i believe it is for being in the vapours and thinking of issabel and mr clinker i was going into a fit of astericks when this fiff saving your presence took me by the nose so powerfully that i sneezed three times and found myself wonderfully refreshed and this to be sure is the raisin why there are no fits in haddingborrough  i was likewise made believe that there was nothing to be had but oatmeal and seepsheads but if i hadnt been a fool i mought have known there could be no heads without kerkassesthis very blessed day i dined upon a delicate leg of velsh mutton and cullyflower and as for the oatmeal i leave that to the sarvants of the country which are pore drudges many of them without shoes or stockingsmr clinker tells me here is a great call of the gospel but i wish i wish some of our family be not fallen off from the rite wayo if i was given to tailbaring i have my own secrets to discoverthere has been a deal of huggling and flurtation betwixt mistress and an ould scotch officer called kismycago he looks for all the orld like the scarecrow that our gardener has set up to frite away the sparrows and what will come of it the lord knows but come what will it shall never be said that i menchioned a syllabub of the matterremember me kindly to saul and the kitteni hope they got the hornbuck and will put it to a good yuse which is the constant prayer of  dear molly your loving friend win jenkins addingborough july        to sir watkin phillips bart of jesus college oxon  dear phillips  if i stay much longer at edinburgh i shall be changed into a downright caledonianmy uncle observes that i have already acquired something of the country accent the people here are so social and attentive in their civilities to strangers that i am insensibly sucked into the channel of their manners and customs although they are in fact much more different from ours than you can imaginethat difference however which struck me very much at my first arrival i now hardly perceive and my ear is perfectly reconciled to the scotch accent which i find even agreeable in the mouth of a pretty womanit is a sort of doric dialect which gives an idea of amiable simplicityyou cannot imagine how we have been caressed and feasted in the good town of edinburgh of which we are become free denizens and guild brothers by the special favour of the magistracy  i had a whimsical commission from bath to a citizen of this metropolis quin understanding our intention to visit edinburgh pulled out a guinea and desired the favour i would drink it at a tavern with a particular friend and bottlecompanion of his mr r c a lawyer of this cityi charged myself with the commission and taking the guinea you see said i i have pocketed your bounty yes replied quin laughing and a headake into the bargain if you drink fair i made use of this introduction to mr c who received me with open arms and gave me the rendezvous according to the cartel he had provided a company of jolly fellows among whom i found myself extremely happy and did mr c and quin all the justice in my power but alas i was no more than a tiro among a troop of veterans who had compassion upon my youth and conveyed me home in the morning by what means i know notquin was mistaken however as to the headake the claret was too good to treat me so roughly  while mr bramble holds conferences with the graver literati of the place and our females are entertained at visits by the scotch ladies who are the best and kindest creatures upon earth i pass my time among the bucks of edinburgh who with a great share of spirit and vivacity have a certain shrewdness and selfcommand that is not often found among their neighbours in the highday of youth and exultationnot a hint escapes a scotchman that can be interpreted into offence by any individual in the company and national reflections are never heardin this particular i must own we are both unjust and ungrateful to the scots for as far as i am able to judge they have a real esteem for the natives of southbritain and never mention our country but with expressions of regardnevertheless they are far from being servile imitators of our modes and fashionable vices all their customs and regulations of public and private oeconomy of business and diversion are in their own stile this remarkably predominates in their looks their dress and manner their music and even their cookery our squire declares that he knows not another people upon earth so strongly marked with a national characternow we are upon the article of cookery i must own some of their dishes are savoury and even delicate but i am not yet scotchman enough to relish their singed sheepshead and haggice which were provided at our request one day at mr mitchelsons where we dinedthe first put me in mind of the history of congo in which i had read of negroes heads sold publickly in the markets the last being a mess of minced lights livers suet oatmeal onions and pepper inclosed in a sheeps stomach had a very sudden effect upon mine and the delicate mrs tabby changed colour when the cause of our disgust was instantaneously removed at the nod of our entertainer the scots in general are attached to this composition with a sort of national fondness as well as to their oatmeal bread which is presented at every table in thin triangular cakes baked upon a plate of iron called a girdle and these many of the natives even in the higher ranks of life prefer to wheatenbread which they have here in perfectionyou know we used to vex poor murray of baliol college by asking if there was really no fruit but turnips in scotlandsure enough i have seen turnips make their appearance not as a desert but by way of hors doeuvres or whets as radishes are served betwixt more substantial dishes in france and italy but it must be observed that the turnips of this country are as much superior in sweetness delicacy and flavour to those in england as a muskmelon is to the stock of a common cabbage they are small and conical of a yellowish colour with a very thin skin and over and above their agreeable taste are valuable for their antiscorbutic qualityas to the fruit now in season such as cherries gooseberries and currants there is no want of them at edinburgh and in the gardens of some gentlemen who live in the neighbourhood there is now a very favourable appearance of apricots peaches nectarines and even grapes nay i have seen a very fine shew of pineapples within a few miles of this metropolis indeed we have no reason to be surprised at these particulars when we consider how little difference there is in fact betwixt this climate and that of london  all the remarkable places in the city and its avenues for ten miles around we have visited much to our satisfaction in the castle are some royal apartments where the sovereign occasionally resided and here are carefully preserved the regalia of the kingdom consisting of a crown said to be of great value a sceptre and a sword of state adorned with jewelsof these symbols of sovereignty the people are exceedingly jealousa report being spread during the sitting of the unionparliament that they were removed to london such a tumult arose that the lord commissioner would have been torn to pieces if he had not produced them for the satisfaction of the populace  the palace of holyroodhouse is an elegant piece of architecture but sunk in an obscure and as i take it unwholesome bottom where one would imagine it had been placed on purpose to be concealed the apartments are lofty but unfurnished and as for the pictures of the scottish kings from fergus i to king william they are paultry daubings mostly by the same hand painted either from the imagination or porters hired to sit for the purpose all the diversions of london we enjoy at edinburgh in a small compass here is a well conducted concert in which several gentlemen perform on different instrumentsthe scots are all musiciansevery man you meet plays on the flute the violin or violoncello and there is one nobleman whose compositions are universally admiredour company of actors is very tolerable and a subscription is now on foot for building a new theatre but their assemblies please me above all other public exhibitions  we have been at the hunters ball where i was really astonished to see such a number of fine womenthe english who have never crossed the tweed imagine erroneously that the scotch ladies are not remarkable for personal attractions but i can declare with a safe conscience i never saw so many handsome females together as were assembled on this occasion at the leith races the best company comes hither from the remoter provinces so that i suppose we had all the beauty of the kingdom concentrated as it were into one focus which was indeed so vehement that my heart could hardly resist its power between friends it has sustained some damage from the bright eyes of the charming miss renton whom i had the honour to dance with at the ballthe countess of melville attracted all eyes and the admiration of all presentshe was accompanied by the agreeable miss grieve who made many conquests nor did my sister liddy pass unnoticed in the assemblyshe is become a toast at edinburgh by the name of the fair cambrian and has already been the occasion of much wineshed but the poor girl met with an accident at the ball which has given us great disturbance  a young gentleman the express image of that rascal wilson went up to ask her to dance a minuet and his sudden appearance shocked her so much that she fainted awayi call wilson a rascal because if he had been really a gentleman with honourable intentions he would have ere now appeared in his own characteri must own my blood boils with indignation when i think of that fellows presumption and heaven confound me if i dontbut i wont be so womanish as to railtime will perhaps furnish occasionthank god the cause of liddys disorder remains a secret the lady directress of the ball thinking she was overcome by the heat of the place had her conveyed to another room where she soon recovered so well as to return and join in the country dances in which the scotch lasses acquit themselves with such spirit and agility as put their partners to the height of their mettle i believe our aunt mrs tabitha had entertained hopes of being able to do some execution among the cavaliers at this assembly she had been several days in consultation with milliners and mantuamakers preparing for the occasion at which she made her appearance in a full suit of damask so thick and heavy that the sight of it alone at this season of the year was sufficient to draw drops of sweat from any man of ordinary imaginationshe danced one minuet with our friend mr mitchelson who favoured her so far in the spirit of hospitality and politeness and she was called out a second time by the young laird of ballymawhawple who coming in by accident could not readily find any other partner but as the first was a married man and the second payed no particular homage to her charms which were also overlooked by the rest of the company she became dissatisfied and censoriousat supper she observed that the scotch gentlemen made a very good figure when they were a little improved by travelling and therefore it was pity they did not all take the benefit of going abroad she said the women were awkward masculine creatures that in dancing they lifted their legs like so many colts that they had no idea of graceful motion and put on their clothes in a frightful manner but if the truth must be told tabby herself was the most ridiculous figure and the worst dressed of the whole assembly the neglect of the male sex rendered her malcontent and peevish she now found fault with every thing at edinburgh and teized her brother to leave the place when she was suddenly reconciled to it on a religious considerationthere is a sect of fanaticks who have separated themselves from the established kirk under the name of secedersthey acknowledge no earthly head of the church reject laypatronage and maintain the methodist doctrines of the new birth the new light the efficacy of grace the insufficiency of works and the operations of the spirit mrs tabitha attended by humphry clinker was introduced to one of their conventicles where they both received much edification and she has had the good fortune to come acquainted with a pious christian called mr moffat who is very powerful in prayer and often assists her in private exercises of devotion  i never saw such a concourse of genteel company at any races in england as appeared on the course of leithhard by in the fields called the links the citizens of edinburgh divert themselves at a game called golf in which they use a curious kind of bats tipt with horn and small elastic balls of leather stuffed with feathers rather less than tennis balls but of a much harder consistencethis they strike with such force and dexterity from one hole to another that they will fly to an incredible distance of this diversion the scots are so fond that when the weather will permit you may see a multitude of all ranks from the senator of justice to the lowest tradesman mingled together in their shirts and following the balls with the utmost eagerness among others i was shewn one particular set of golfers the youngest of whom was turned of fourscorethey were all gentlemen of independent fortunes who had amused themselves with this pastime for the best part of a century without having ever felt the least alarm from sickness or disgust and they never went to bed without having each the best part of a gallon of claret in his belly such uninterrupted exercise cooperating with the keen air from the sea must without all doubt keep the appetite always on edge and steel the constitution against all the common attacks of distemper  the leith races gave occasion to another entertainment of a very singular naturethere is at edinburgh a society or corporation of errandboys called cawdies who ply in the streets at night with paper lanthorns and are very serviceable in carrying messagesthese fellows though shabby in their appearance and rudely familiar in their address are wonderfully acute and so noted for fidelity that there is no instance of a cawdys having betrayed his trustsuch is their intelligence that they know not only every individual of the place but also every stranger by that time he has been four and twenty hours in edinburgh and no transaction even the most private can escape their notice they are particularly famous for their dexterity in executing one of the functions of mercury though for my own part i never employed them in this department of businesshad i occasion for any service of this nature my own man archy malpine is as well qualified as eer a cawdie in edinburgh and i am much mistaken if he has not been heretofore of their fraternity be that as it may they resolved to give a dinner and a ball at leith to which they formally invited all the young noblemen and gentlemen that were at the races and this invitation was reinforced by an assurance that all the celebrated ladies of pleasure would grace the entertainment with their companyi received a card on this occasion and went thither with half a dozen of my acquaintancein a large hall the cloth was laid on a long range of tables joined together and here the company seated themselves to the number of about fourscore lords and lairds and other gentlemen courtezans and cawdies mingled together as the slaves and their masters were in the time of the saturnalia in ancient romethe toast master who sat at the upper end was one cawdie fraser a veteran pimp distinguished for his humour and sagacity well known and much respected in his profession by all the guests male and female that were here assembledhe had bespoke the dinner and the wine he had taken care that all his brethren should appear in decent apparel and clean linen and he himself wore a periwig with three tails in honour of the festivali assure you the banquet was both elegant and plentiful and seasoned with a thousand sallies that promoted a general spirit of mirth and good humourafter the desert mr fraser proposed the following toasts which i dont pretend to explain the best in christendomgibbs contractthe beggars benisonking and kirkgreat britain and ireland then filling a bumper and turning to me mester malford said he may a unkindness cease betwixt john bull and his sister moggythe next person he singled out was a nobleman who had been long abroadma lord cried fraser here is a bumper to a those noblemen who have virtue enough to spend their rents in their ain countrayhe afterwards addressed himself to a member of parliament in these wordsmeesterim sure yell ha nae objection to my drinking disgrace and dule to ilka scot that sells his conscience and his votehe discharged a third sarcasm at a person very gaily dressed who had risen from small beginnings and made a considerable fortune at playfilling his glass and calling him by name lang life said he to the wylie loon that gangs afield with a toom poke at his lunzie and comes hame with a sackful of sillerall these toasts being received with loud bursts of applause mr fraser called for pint glasses and filled his own to the brim then standing up and all his brethren following his example ma lords and gentlemen cried he here is a cup of thanks for the great and undeserved honour you have done your poor errandboys this dayso saying he and they drank off their glasses in a trice and quitting their seats took their station each behind one of the other guests exclaiming noo were your honours cawdies again  the nobleman who had bore the first brunt of mr frasers satire objected to his abdication he said as the company was assembled by invitation from the cawdies he expected they were to be entertained at their expense by no means my lord cried fraser i wad na he guilty of sic presumption for the wide warldi never affronted a gentleman since i was born and sure at this age i wonnot offer an indignity to sic an honourable convention well said his lordship as you have expended some wit you have a right to save your money you have given me good counsel and i take it in good part as you have voluntarily quitted your seat i will take your place with the leave of the good company and think myself happy to be hailed father of the feast he was forthwith elected into the chair and complimented in a bumper in his new character  the claret continued to circulate without interruption till the glasses seemed to dance upon the table and this perhaps was a hint to the ladies to call for musicat eight in the evening the ball began in another apartment at midnight we went to supper but it was broad day before i found the way to my lodgings and no doubt his lordship had a swinging bill to discharge  in short i have lived so riotously for some weeks that my uncle begins to be alarmed on the score of my constitution and very seriously observes that all his own infirmities are owing to such excesses indulged in his youthmrs tabitha says it would be more to the advantage of my soul as well as body if instead of frequenting these scenes of debauchery i would accompany mr moffat and her to hear a sermon of the reverend mr mcorkindaleclinker often exhorts me with a groan to take care of my precious health and even archy malpine when he happens to be overtaken which is oftener the case than i could wish reads me a long lecture upon temperance and sobriety and is so very wise and sententious that if i could provide him with a professors chair i would willingly give up the benefit of his amonitions and service together for i was tutorsick at alma mater  i am not however so much engrossed by the gaieties of edinburgh but that i find time to make parties in the family way we have not only seen all the villas and villages within ten miles of the capital but we have also crossed the firth which is an arm of the sea seven miles broad that divides lothian from the shire or as the scots call it the kingdom of fife there is a number of large open seaboats that ply on this passage from leith to kinghorn which is a borough on the other side in one of these our whole family embarked three days ago excepting my sister who being exceedingly fearful of the water was left to the care of mrs mitchelson we had an easy and quick passage into fife where we visited a number of poor towns on the seaside including st andrews which is the skeleton of a venerable city but we were much better pleased with some noble and elegant seats and castles of which there is a great number in that part of scotland yesterday we took boat again on our return to leith with fair wind and agreeable weather but we had not advanced halfway when the sky was suddenly overcast and the wind changing blew directly in our teeth so that we were obliged to turn or tack the rest of the way in a word the gale increased to a storm of wind and rain attended with such a fog that we could not see the town of leith to which we were bound nor even the castle of edinburgh notwithstanding its high situation it is not to be doubted but that we were all alarmed on this occasion and at the same time most of the passengers were seized with a nausea that produced violent retchings my aunt desired her brother to order the boatmen to put back to kinghorn and this expedient he actually proposed but they assured him there was no danger mrs tabitha finding them obstinate began to scold and insisted upon my uncles exerting his authority as a justice of the peace sick and peevish as he was he could not help laughing at this wise proposal telling her that his commission did not extend so far and if it did he should let the people take their own way for he thought it would be great presumption in him to direct them in the exercise of their own profession mrs winifred jenkins made a general clearance with the assistance of mr humphry clinker who joined her both in prayer and ejaculationas he took it for granted that we should not be long in this world he offered some spiritual consolation to mrs tabitha who rejected it with great disgust bidding him keep his sermons for those who had leisure to hear such nonsensemy uncle sat collected in himself without speaking my man archy had recourse to a brandybottle with which he made so free that i imagined he had sworn to die of drinking any thing rather than seawater but the brandy had no more effect upon him in the way of intoxication than if it had been seawater in good earnestas for myself i was too much engrossed by the sickness at my stomach to think of any thing else meanwhile the sea swelled mountains high the boat pitched with such violence as if it had been going to pieces the cordage rattled the wind roared the lightning flashed the thunder bellowed and the rain descended in a delugeevery time the vessel was put about we shipd a sea that drenched us all to the skinwhen by dint of turning we thought to have cleared the pier head we were driven to leeward and then the boatmen themselves began to fear that the tide would fail before we should fetch up our leeway the next trip however brought us into smooth water and we were safely landed on the quay about one oclock in the afternoonto be sure cried tabby when she found herself on terra firma we must all have perished if we had not been the particular care of providence yes replied my uncle but i am much of the honest highlanders mindafter he had made such a passage as this his friend told him he was much indebted to providencecertainly said donald but by my saul mon ise neer trouble providence again so long as the brig of stirling standsyou must know the brig or bridge of stirling stands above twenty miles up the river forth of which this is the outleti dont find that our squire has suffered in his health from this adventure but poor liddy is in a peaking wayim afraid this unfortunate girl is uneasy in her mind and this apprehension distracts me for she is really an amiable creature  we shall set out tomorrow or next day for stirling and glasgow and we propose to penetrate a little way into the highlands before we turn our course to the southwardin the mean time commend me to all our friends round carfax and believe me to be ever yours  edinburgh aug   j melford     to dr lewis  i should be very ungrateful dear lewis if i did not find myself disposed to think and speak favourably of this people among whom i have met with more kindness hospitality and rational entertainment in a few weeks than ever i received in any other country during the whole course of my lifeperhaps the gratitude excited by these benefits may interfere with the impartiality of my remarks for a man is as apt to be prepossessed by particular favours as to be prejudiced by private motives of disgust if i am partial there is at least some merit in my conversion from illiberal prejudices which had grown up with my constitution  the first impressions which an englishman receives in this country will not contribute to the removal of his prejudices because he refers every thing he sees to a comparison with the same articles in his own country and this comparison is unfavourable to scotland in all its exteriors such as the face of the country in respect to cultivation the appearance of the bulk of the people and the language of conversation in generali am not so far convinced by mr lismahagos arguments but that i think the scots would do well for their own sakes to adopt the english idioms and pronunciation those of them especially who are resolved to push their fortunes in southbritaini know by experience how easily an englishman is influenced by the ear and how apt he is to laugh when he hears his own language spoken with a foreign or provincial accenti have known a member of the house of commons speak with great energy and precision without being able to engage attention because his observations were made in the scotch dialect which no offence to lieutenant lismahago certainly gives a clownish air even to sentiments of the greatest dignity and decorumi have declared my opinion on this head to some of the most sensible men of this country observing at the same time that if they would employ a few natives of england to teach the pronunciation of our vernacular tongue in twenty years there would be no difference in point of dialect between the youth of edinburgh and of london  the civil regulations of this kingdom and metropolis are taken from very different models from those of england except in a few particular establishments the necessary consequences of the uniontheir college of justice is a bench of great dignity filled with judges of character and abilityi have heard some causes tried before this venerable tribunal and was very much pleased with the pleadings of their advocates who are by no means deficient either in argument or elocution the scottish legislation is founded in a great measure on the civil law consequently their proceedings vary from those of the english tribunals but i think they have the advantage of us in their method of examining witnesses apart and in the constitution of their jury by which they certainly avoid the evil which i mentioned in my last from lismahagos observation  the university of edinburgh is supplied with excellent professors in all the sciences and the medical school in particular is famous all over europethe students of this art have the best opportunity of learning it to perfection in all its branches as there are different courses for the theory of medicine and the practice of medicine for anatomy chemistry botany and the materia medica over and above those of mathematics and experimental philosophy and all these are given by men of distinguished talents what renders this part of education still more complete is the advantage of attending the infirmary which is the best instituted charitable foundation that i ever knew now we are talking of charities here are several hospitals exceedingly well endowed and maintained under admirable regulations and these are not only useful but ornamental to the city among these i shall only mention the general workhouse in which all the poor not otherwise provided for are employed according to their different abilities with such judgment and effect that they nearly maintain themselves by their labour and there is not a beggar to be seen within the precincts of this metropolis it was glasgow that set the example of this establishment about thirty years agoeven the kirk of scotland so long reproached with fanaticism and canting abounds at present with ministers celebrated for their learning and respectable for their moderationi have heard their sermons with equal astonishment and pleasurethe good people of edinburgh no longer think dirt and cobwebs essential to the house of godsome of their churches have admitted such ornaments as would have excited sedition even in england a little more than a century ago and psalmody is here practised and taught by a professor from the cathedral of durhami should not be surprised in a few years to hear it accompanied with an organ  edinburgh is a hotbed of geniusi have had the good fortune to be made acquainted with many authors of the first distinction such as the two humes robertson smith wallace blair ferguson wilkie c and i have found them all as agreeable in conversation as they are instructive and entertaining in their writings these acquaintances i owe to the friendship of dr carlyle who wants nothing but inclination to figure with the rest upon paper the magistracy of edinburgh is changed every year by election and seems to be very well adapted both for state and authoritythe lord provost is equal in dignity to the lord mayor of london and the four bailies are equivalent to the rank of aldermenthere is a dean of guild who takes cognizance of mercantile affairs a treasurer a townclerk and the council is composed of deacons one of whom is returned every year in rotation as representative of every company of artificers or handicraftsmen though this city from the nature of its situation can never be made either very convenient or very cleanly it has nevertheless an air of magnificence that commands respectthe castle is an instance of the sublime in scite and architectureits fortifications are kept in good order and there is always in it a garrison of regular soldiers which is relieved every year but it is incapable of sustaining a siege carried on according to the modern operations of warthe castle hill which extends from the outward gate to the upper end of the high street is used as a public walk for the citizens and commands a prospect equally extensive and delightful over the county of fife on the other side of the frith and all along the seacoast which is covered with a succession of towns that would seem to indicate a considerable share of commerce but if the truth must be told these towns have been falling to decay ever since the union by which the scots were in a great measure deprived of their trade with francethe palace of holyroodhouse is a jewel in architecture thrust into a hollow where it cannot be seen a situation which was certainly not chosen by the ingenious architect who must have been confined to the site of the old palace which was a convent edinburgh is considerably extended on the south side where there are divers little elegant squares built in the english manner and the citizens have planned some improvements on the north which when put in execution will add greatly to the beauty and convenience of this capital  the seaport is leith a flourishing town about a mile from the city in the harbour of which i have seen above one hundred ships lying all together you must know i had the curiosity to cross the frith in a passage boat and stayed two days in fife which is remarkably fruitful in corn and exhibits a surprising number of fine seats elegantly built and magnificently furnished there is an incredible number of noble houses in every part of scotland that i have seendalkeith pinkie yester and lord hoptons hopetouns all of them within four or five miles of edinburgh are princely palaces in every one of which a sovereign might reside at his casei suppose the scots affect these monuments of grandeurif i may be allowed to mingle censure with my remarks upon a people i revere i must observe that their weak side seems to be vanityi am afraid that even their hospitality is not quite free of ostentation i think i have discovered among them uncommon pains taken to display their fine linen of which indeed they have great plenty their furniture plate housekeeping and variety of wines in which article it must be owned they are profuse if not prodigala burgher of edinburgh not content to vie with a citizen of london who has ten times his fortune must excel him in the expence as well as elegance of his entertainments  though the villas of the scotch nobility and gentry have generally an air of grandeur and state i think their gardens and parks are not comparable to those of england a circumstance the more remarkable as i was told by the ingenious mr phillip miller of chelsea that almost all the gardeners of southbritain were natives of scotland the verdure of this country is not equal to that of englandthe pleasuregrounds are in my opinion not so well laid out according to the genius loci nor are the lawns and walks and hedges kept in such delicate orderthe trees are planted in prudish rows which have not such an agreeable natural effect as when they are thrown into irregular groupes with intervening glades and firs which they generally raise around their houses look dull and funereal in the summer seasoni must confess indeed that they yield serviceable timber and good shelter against the northern blasts that they grow and thrive in the most barren soil and continually perspire a fine balsam of turpentine which must render the air very salutary and sanative to lungs of a tender texture  tabby and i have been both frightened in our return by sea from the coast of fifeshe was afraid of drowning and i of catching cold in consequence of being drenched with seawater but my fears as well as hers have been happily disappointed she is now in perfect health i wish i could say the same of liddysomething uncommon is the matter with that poor girl her colour fades her appetite fails and her spirits flagshe is become moping and melancholy and is often found in tearsher brother suspects internal uneasiness on account of wilson and denounces vengeance against that adventurershe was it seems strongly affected at the ball by the sudden appearance of one mr gordon who strongly resembles the said wilson but i am rather suspicious that she caught cold by being overheated with dancingi have consulted dr gregory an eminent physician of an amiable character who advises the highland air and the use of goatmilk whey which surely cannot have a bad effect upon a patient who was born and bred among the mountains of walesthe doctors opinion is the more agreeable as we shall find those remedies in the very place which i proposed as the utmost extent of our expeditioni mean the borders of argyle  mr smollett one of the judges of the commissary court which is now sitting has very kindly insisted upon our lodging at his countryhouse on the banks of loughlomond about fourteen miles beyond glasgow for this last city we shall set out in two days and take stirling in our way well provided with recommendations from our friends at edinburgh whom i protest i shall leave with much regret i am so far from thinking it any hardship to live in this country that if i was obliged to lead a town life edinburgh would certainly be the headquarters of   yours always matt bramble edin august       to sir watkin phillips bart of jesus college oxon  dear knight  i am now little short of the ultima thule if this appellation properly belongs to the orkneys or hebrides these last are now lying before me to the amount of some hundreds scattered up and down the deucalidonian sea affording the most picturesque and romantic prospect i ever beheldi write this letter in a gentlemans house near the town of inverary which may be deemed the capital of the west highlands famous for nothing so much as for the stately castle begun and actually covered in by the late duke of argyle at a prodigious expencewhether it will ever be completely finished is a question  but to take things in orderwe left edinburgh ten days ago and the further north we proceed we find mrs tabitha the less manageable so that her inclinations are not of the nature of the loadstone they point not towards the pole what made her leave edinburgh with reluctance at last if we may believe her own assertions was a dispute which she left unfinished with mr moffat touching the eternity of hell torments that gentleman as he advanced in years began to be sceptical on this head till at length he declared open war against the common acceptation of the word eternal he is now persuaded that eternal signifies no more than an indefinite number of years and that the most enormous sinner may be quit for nine millions nine hundred thousand nine hundred and ninetynine years of hellfire which term or period as he very well observes forms but an inconsiderable drop as it were in the ocean of eternityfor this mitigation he contends as a system agreeable to the ideas of goodness and mercy which we annex to the supreme beingour aunt seemed willing to adopt this doctrine in favour of the wicked but he hinted that no person whatever was so righteous as to be exempted entirely from punishment in a future state and that the most pious christian upon earth might think himself very happy to get off for a fast of seven or eight thousand years in the midst of fire and brimstone mrs tabitha revolted at this dogma which filled her at once with horror and indignationshe had recourse to the opinion of humphry clinker who roundly declared it was the popish doctrine of purgatory and quoted scripture in defence of the fire everlasting prepared for the devil and his angelsthe reverend master mackcorkendal and all the theologists and saints of that persuasion were consulted and some of them had doubts about the matter which doubts and scruples had begun to infect our aunt when we took our departure from edinburgh  we passed through linlithgow where there was an elegant royal palace which is now gone to decay as well as the town itselfthis too is pretty much the case with stirling though it still boasts of a fine old castle in which the kings of scotland were wont to reside in their minoritybut glasgow is the pride of scotland and indeed it might very well pass for an elegant and flourishing city in any part of christendom there we had the good fortune to be received into the house of mr moore an eminent surgeon to whom we were recommended by one of our friends at edinburgh and truly he could not have done us more essential servicemr moore is a merry facetious companion sensible and shrewd with a considerable fund of humour and his wife an agreeable woman well bred kind and obliging kindness which i take to be the essence of goodnature and humanity is the distinguishing characteristic of the scotch ladies in their own countryour landlord shewed us every thing and introduced us to all the world at glasgow where through his recommendation we were complimented with the freedom of the town considering the trade and opulence of this place it cannot but abound with gaiety and diversions here is a great number of young fellows that rival the youth of the capital in spirit and expence and i was soon convinced that all the female beauties of scotland were not assembled at the hunters ball in edinburghthe town of glasgow flourishes in learning as well as in commercehere is an university with professors in all the different branches of science liberally endowed and judiciously chosenit was vacation time when i passed so that i could not entirely satisfy my curiosity but their mode of education is certainly preferable to ours in some respects the students are not left to the private instruction of tutors but taught in public schools or classes each science by its particular professor or regent  my uncle is in raptures with glasgowhe not only visited all the manufactures of the place but made excursions all round to hamilton paisley renfrew and every other place within a dozen miles where there was any thing remarkable to be seen in art or nature i believe the exercise occasioned by those jaunts was of service to my sister liddy whose appetite and spirits begin to revivemrs tabitha displayed her attractions as usual and actually believed she had entangled one mr maclellan a rich inklemanufacturer in her snares but when matters came to an explanation it appeared that his attachment was altogether spiritual founded upon an intercourse of devotion at the meeting of mr john wesley who in the course of his evangelical mission had come hither in personat length we set out for the banks of loughlomond passing through the little borough of dumbarton or as my uncle will have it dunbritton where there is a castle more curious than any thing of the kind i had ever seen it is honoured with a particular description by the elegant buchanan as an arx inexpugnabilis and indeed it must have been impregnable by the antient manner of besieging it is a rock of considerable extent rising with a double top in an angle formed by the confluence of two rivers the clyde and the leven perpendicular and inaccessible on all sides except in one place where the entrance is fortified and there is no rising ground in the neighbourhood from whence it could be damaged by any kind of battery  from dumbarton the west highlands appear in the form of huge dusky mountains piled one over another but this prospect is not at all surprising to a native of glamorganwe have fixed our headquarters at cameron a very neat countryhouse belonging to commissary smollet where we found every sort of accommodation we could desireit is situated like a druids temple in a grove of oak close by the side of loughlomond which is a surprising body of pure transparent water unfathomably deep in many places six or seven miles broad four and twenty miles in length displaying above twenty green islands covered with wood some of them cultivated for corn and many of them stocked with red deerthey belong to different gentlemen whose seats are scattered along the banks of the lake which are agreeably romantic beyond all conception my uncle and i have left the women at cameron as mrs tabitha would by no means trust herself again upon the water and to come hither it was necessary to cross a small inlet of the sea in an open ferryboatthis country appears more and more wild and savage the further we advance and the people are as different from the lowland scots in their looks garb and language as the mountaineers of brecknock are from the inhabitants of herefordshire  when the lowlanders want to drink a chearuppingcup they go to the public house called the changehouse and call for a chopine of twopenny which is a thin yeasty beverage made of malt not quite so strong as the tablebeer of englandthis is brought in a pewter stoop shaped like a skittle from whence it is emptied into a quaff that is a curious cup made of different pieces of wood such as box and ebony cut into little staves joined alternately and secured with delicate hoops having two cars or handlesit holds about a gill is sometimes tipt round the mouth with silver and has a plate of the same metal at bottom with the landlords cypher engravedthe highlanders on the contrary despise this liquor and regale themselves with whisky a malt spirit as strong as geneva which they swallow in great quantities without any signs of inebriation they are used to it from the cradle and find it an excellent preservative against the winter cold which must be extreme on these mountainsi am told that it is given with great success to infants as a cordial in the confluent smallpox when the eruption seems to flag and the symptoms grow unfavourablethe highlanders are used to eat much more animal food than falls to the share of their neighbours in the lowcountrythey delight in hunting have plenty of deer and other game with a great number of sheep goats and blackcattle running wild which they scruple not to kill as vension without being much at pains to ascertain the property  inverary is but a poor town though it stands immediately under the protection of the duke of argyle who is a mighty prince in this part of scotland the peasants live in wretched cabins and seem very poor but the gentlemen are tolerably well lodged and so loving to strangers that a man runs some risque of his life from their hospitalityit must be observed that the poor highlanders are now seen to disadvantage they have been not only disarmed by act of parliament but also deprived of their ancient garb which was both graceful and convenient and what is a greater hardship still they are compelled to wear breeches a restraint which they cannot bear with any degree of patience indeed the majority wear them not in the proper place but on poles or long staves over their shouldersthey are even debarred the use of their striped stuff called tartane which was their own manufacture prized by them above all the velvets brocades and tissues of europe and asia they now lounge along in loose great coats of coarse russet equally mean and cumbersome and betray manifest marks of dejectioncertain it is the government could not have taken a more effectual method to break their national spirit  we have had princely sport in hunting the stag on these mountains these are the lonely hills of morven where fingal and his heroes enjoyed the same pastime i feel an enthusiastic pleasure when i survey the brown heath that ossian wont to tread and hear the wind whistle through the bending grasswhen i enter our landlords hall i look for the suspended harp of that divine bard and listen in hopes of hearing the aerial sound of his respected spiritthe poems of ossian are in every moutha famous antiquarian of this country the laird of macfarlane at whose house we dined a few days ago can repeat them all in the original gallick which has a great affinity to the welch not only in the general sound but also in a great number of radical words and i make no doubt that they are both sprung from the same origin i was not a little surprised when asking a highlander one day if he knew where we should find any game he replied hu niel sassenagh which signifies no english the very same answer i should have received from a welchman and almost in the same words the highlanders have no other name for the people of the lowcountry but sassenagh or saxons a strong presumption that the lowland scots and the english are derived from the same stockthe peasants of these hills strongly resemble those of wales in their looks their manners and habitations every thing i see and hear and feel seems welchthe mountains vales and streams the air and climate the beef mutton and game are all welchit must be owned however that this people are better provided than we in some articlesthey have plenty of red deer and roebuck which are fat and delicious at this season of the year their sea teems with amazing quantities of the finest fish in the world and they find means to procure very good claret at a very small expence  our landlord is a man of consequence in this part of the country a cadet from the family of argyle and hereditary captain of one of his castleshis name in plain english is dougal campbell but as there is a great number of the same appellation they are distinguished like the welch by patronimics and as i have known an antient briton called madoc apmorgan apjenkin apjones our highland chief designs himself doul macamish macoul ichian signifying dougal the son of james the son of dougal the son of john he has travelled in the course of his education and is disposed to make certain alterations in his domestic oeconomy but he finds it impossible to abolish the ancient customs of the family some of which are ludicrous enoughhis piper for example who is an hereditary officer of the household will not part with the least particle of his privileges he has a right to wear the kilt or ancient highland dress with the purse pistol and durka broad yellow ribbon fixed to the chanterpipe is thrown over his shoulder and trails along the ground while he performs the function of his minstrelsy and this i suppose is analogous to the pennon or flag which was formerly carried before every knight in battlehe plays before the laird every sunday in his way to the kirk which he circles three times performing the family march which implies defiance to all the enemies of the clan and every morning he plays a full hour by the clock in the great hall marching backwards and forwards all the time with a solemn pace attended by the lairds kinsmen who seem much delighted with the musicin this exercise he indulges them with a variety of pibrochs or airs suited to the different passions which he would either excite or assuage  mr campbell himself who performs very well on the violin has an invincible antipathy to the sound of the highland bagpipe which sings in the nose with a most alarming twang and indeed is quite intolerable to ears of common sensibility when aggravated by the echo of a vaulted hallhe therefore begged the piper would have some mercy upon him and dispense with this part of the morning servicea consultation of the clan being held on this occasion it was unanimously agreed that the lairds request could not be granted without a dangerous encroachment upon the customs of the familythe piper declared he could not give up for a moment the privilege he derived from his ancestors nor would the lairds relations forego an entertainment which they valued above all othersthere was no remedy mr campbell being obliged to acquiesce is fain to stop his ears with cotton to fortify his head with three or four nightcaps and every morning retire into the penetralia of his habitation in order to avoid this diurnal annoyance when the music ceases he produces himself at an open window that looks into the courtyard which is by this time filled with a crowd of his vassals and dependents who worship his first appearance by uncovering their heads and bowing to the earth with the most humble prostration as all these people have something to communicate in the way of proposal complaint or petition they wait patiently till the laird comes forth and following him in his walks are favoured each with a short audience in his turn two days ago he dispatched above an hundred different sollicitors in walking with us to the house of a neighbouring gentleman where we dined by invitation our landlords housekeeping is equally rough and hospitable and savours much of the simplicity of ancient times the great hall paved with flat stones is about fortyfive feet by twentytwo and serves not only for a diningroom but also for a bedchamber to gentlemendependents and hangerson of the family at night half a dozen occasional beds are ranged on each side along the wall these are made of fresh heath pulled up by the roots and disposed in such a manner as to make a very agreeable couch where they lie without any other covering than the plaidmy uncle and i were indulged with separate chambers and down beds which we begged to exchange for a layer of heath and indeed i never slept so much to my satisfaction it was not only soft and elastic but the plant being in flower diffused an agreeable fragrance which is wonderfully refreshing and restorative  yesterday we were invited to the funeral of an old lady the grandmother of a gentleman in this neighbourhood and found ourselves in the midst of fifty people who were regaled with a sumptuous feast accompanied by the music of a dozen pipers in short this meeting had all the air of a grand festival and the guests did such honour to the entertainment that many of them could not stand when we were reminded of the business on which we had met the company forthwith taking horse rode in a very irregular cavalcade to the place of interment a church at the distance of two long miles from the castle on our arrival however we found we had committed a small oversight in leaving the corpse behind so we were obliged to wheel about and met the old gentlewoman half way being carried upon poles by the nearest relations of her family and attended by the coronach composed of a multitude of old hags who tore their hair beat their breasts and howled most hideously at the grave the orator or senachie pronounced the panegyric of the defunct every period being confirmed by a yell of the coronach the body was committed to the earth the pipers playing a pibroch all the time and all the company standing uncovered the ceremony was closed with the discharge of pistols then we returned to the castle resumed the bottle and by midnight there was not a sober person in the family the females excepted the squire and i were with some difficulty permitted to retire with our landlord in the evening but our entertainer was a little chagrined at our retreat and afterwards seemed to think it a disparagement to his family that not above a hundred gallons of whisky had been drunk upon such a solemn occasion this morning we got up by four to hunt the roebuck and in half an hour found breakfast ready served in the hall the hunters consisted of sir george colquhoun and me as strangers my uncle not chusing to be of the party of the laird in person the lairds brother the lairds brothers son the lairds sisters son the lairds fathers brothers son and all their foster brothers who are counted parcel of the family but we were attended by an infinite number of gaellys or ragged highlanders without shoes or stockings  the following articles formed our mornings repast one kit of boiled eggs a second full of butter a third full of cream an entire cheese made of goats milk a large earthen pot full of honey the best part of a ham a cold venison pasty a bushel of oat meal made in thin cakes and bannocks with a small wheaten loaf in the middle for the strangers a large stone bottle full of whisky another of brandy and a kilderkin of ale there was a ladle chained to the cream kit with curious wooden bickers to be filled from this reservoir the spirits were drank out of a silver quaff and the ale out of hems great justice was done to the collation by the guest in general one of them in particular ate above two dozen of hard eggs with a proportionable quantity of bread butter and honey nor was one drop of liquor left upon the board finally a large roll of tobacco was presented by way of desert and every individual took a comfortable quid to prevent the bad effects of the morning air we had a fine chace over the mountains after a roebuck which we killed and i got home time enough to drink tea with mrs campbell and our squire tomorrow we shall set out on our return for cameron we propose to cross the frith of clyde and take the towns of greenock and portglasgow in our way this circuit being finished we shall turn our faces to the south and follow the sun with augmented velocity in order to enjoy the rest of the autumn in england where boreas is not quite so biting as he begins already to be on the tops of these northern hills but our progress from place to place shall continue to be specified in these detached journals of  yours always j melford argylshire sept       to dr lewis  dear dick  about a fortnight is now elapsed since we left the capital of scotland directing our course towards stirling where we lay the castle of this place is such another as that of edinburgh and affords a surprising prospect of the windings of the river forth which are so extraordinary that the distance from hence to alloa by land is but forty miles and by water it is twentyfour alloa is a neat thriving town that depends in a great measure on the commerce of glasgow the merchants of which send hither tobacco and other articles to be deposited in warehouses for exportation from the frith of forth in our way hither we visited a flourishing ironwork where instead of burning wood they use coal which they have the art of clearing in such a manner as frees it from the sulphur that would otherwise render the metal too brittle for working excellent coal is found in almost every part of scotland  the soil of this district produces scarce any other grain but oats lid barley perhaps because it is poorly cultivated and almost altogether uninclosed the few inclosures they have consist of paultry walls of loose stones gathered from the fields which indeed they cover as if they had been scattered on purpose when i expressed my surprize that the peasants did not disencumber their grounds of these stones a gentleman well acquainted with the theory as well as practice of farming assured me that the stones far from being prejudicial were serviceable to the crop this philosopher had ordered a field of his own to be cleared manured and sown with barley and the produce was more scanty than before he caused the stones to be replaced and next year the crop was as good as ever the stones were removed a second time and the harvest failed they were again brought back and the ground retrieved its fertility the same experiment has been tried in different parts of scotland with the same successastonished at this information i desired to know in what manner he accounted for this strange phenomenon and he said there were three ways in which the stones might be serviceable they might possibly restrain an excess in the perspiration of the earth analogous to colliquative sweats by which the human body is sometimes wasted and consumed they might act as so many fences to protect the tender blade from the piercing winds of the spring or by multiplying the reflexion of the sun they might increase the warmth so as to mitigate the natural chilness of the soil and climatebut surely this excessive perspiration might be more effectually checked by different kinds of manure such as ashes lime chalk or marl of which last it seems there are many pits in this kingdom as for the warmth it would be much more equally obtained by inclosures the cultivation would require less labour and the ploughs harrows and horses would not suffer half the damage which they now sustain  these northwestern parts are by no means fertile in corn the ground is naturally barren and moorish the peasants are poorly lodged meagre in their looks mean in their apparel and remarkably dirty this last reproach they might easily wash off by means of those lakes rivers and rivulets of pure water with which they are so liberally supplied by nature agriculture cannot be expected to flourish where the farms are small the leases short and the husbandman begins upon a rack rent without a sufficient stock to answer the purposes of improvement the granaries of scotland are the banks of the tweed the counties of east and midlothian the carse of gowrie in perthshire equal in fertility to any part of england and some tracts in aberdeenshire and murray where i am told the harvest is more early than in northumberland although they lie above two degrees farther north i have a strong curiosity to visit many places beyond the forth and the tay such as perth dundee montrose and aberdeen which are towns equally elegant and thriving but the season is too far advanced to admit of this addition to my original plan  i am so far happy as to have seen glasgow which to the best of my recollection and judgment is one of the prettiest towns in europe and without all doubt it is one of the most flourishing in great britain in short it is a perfect beehive in point of industry it stands partly on a gentle declivity but the greatest part of it is in a plain watered by the river clyde the streets are straight open airy and well paved and the houses lofty and well built of hewn stone at the upper end of the town there is a venerable cathedral that may be compared with yorkminster or westminster and about the middle of the descent from this to the cross is the college a respectable pile of building with all manner of accommodation for the professors and students including an elegant library and a observatory well provided with astronomical instruments the number of inhabitants is said to amount to thirty thousand and marks of opulence and independency appear in every quarter of this commercial city which however is not without its inconveniences and defects the water of their public pumps is generally hard and brackish an imperfection the loss excusable as the river clyde runs by their doors in the lower part of the town and there are rivulets and springs above the cathedral sufficient to fill a large reservoir with excellent water which might be thence distributed to all the different parts of the city it is of more consequence to consult the health of the inhabitants in this article than to employ so much attention in beautifying their town with new streets squares and churches another defect not so easily remedied is the shallowness of the river which will not float vessels of any burthen within ten or twelve miles of the city so that the merchants are obliged to load and unload their ships at greenock and portglasgow situated about fourteen miles nearer the mouth of the frith where it is about two miles broad  the people of glasgow have a noble spirit of enterprisemr moore a surgeon to whom i was recommended from edinburgh introduced me to all the principal merchants of the place here i became acquainted with mr cochran who may be stiled one of the sages of this kingdom he was first magistrate at the time of the last rebellion i sat as member when he was examined in the house of commons upon which occasion mr p observed he had never heard such a sensible evidence given at that bar i was also introduced to dr john gordon a patriot of a truly roman spirit who is the father of the linen manufacture in this place and was the great promoter of the city workhouse infirmary and other works of public utility had he lived in ancient rome he would have been honoured with a statue at the public expence i moreover conversed with one mr gssfd whom i take to be one of the greatest merchants in europe in the last war he is said to have had at one time five and twenty ships with their cargoes his own property and to have traded for above half a million sterling ayear the last war was a fortunate period for the commerce of glasgowthe merchants considering that their ships bound for america launching out at once into the atlantic by the north of ireland pursued a track very little frequented by privateers resolved to insure one another and saved a very considerable sum by this resolution as few or none of their ships were takenyou must know i have a sort of national attachment to this part of scotlandthe great church dedicated to st mongah the river clyde and other particulars that smack of our welch language and customs contribute to flatter me with the notion that these people are the descendants of the britons who once possessed this country without all question this was a cumbrian kingdom its capital was dumbarton a corruption of dunbritton which still exists as a royal borough at the influx of the clyde and leven ten miles below glasgow the same neighbourhood gave birth to st patrick the apostle of ireland at a place where there is still a church and village which retain his name hard by are some vestiges of the famous roman wall built in the reign of antonine from the clyde to the forth and fortified with castles to restrain the incursions of the scots or caledonians who inhabited the westhighlands in a line parallel to this wall the merchants of glasgow have determined to make a navigable canal betwixt the two firths which will be of incredible advantage to their commerce in transporting merchandize from one side of the island to the other  from glasgow we travelled along the clyde which is a delightful stream adorned on both sides with villas towns and villages here is no want of groves and meadows and cornfields interspersed but on this side of glasgow there is little other grain than oats and barley the first are much better the last much worse than those of the same species in england i wonder there is so little rye which is a grain that will thrive in almost any soil and it is still more surprising that the cultivation of potatoes should be so much neglected in the highlands where the poor people have not meal enough to supply them with bread through the winter on the other side of the river are the towns of paisley and renfrew the first from an inconsiderable village is become one of the most flourishing places of the kingdom enriched by the linen cambrick flowered lawn and silk manufactures it was formerly noted for a rich monastery of the monks of clugny who wrote the famous scotichronicon called the black book of paisley the old abbey still remains converted into a dwellinghouse belonging to the earl of dundonald renfrew is a pretty town on the banks of clyde capital of the shire which was heretofore the patrimony of the stuart family and gave the title of baron to the kings eldest son which is still assumed by the prince of wales  the clyde we left a little on our lefthand at dunbritton where it widens into an aestuary or frith being augmented by the influx of the leven on this spot stands the castle formerly called alcluyd washed by these two rivers on all sides except a narrow isthmus which at every springtide is overflowed the whole is a great curiosity from the quality and form of the rock as well as from the nature of its situationwe now crossed the water of leven which though nothing near so considerable as the clyde is much more transparent pastoral and delightful this charming stream is the outlet of loughlomond and through a tract of four miles pursues its winding course murmuring over a bed of pebbles till it joins the frith at dunbritton a very little above its source on the lake stands the house of cameron belonging to mr smollett so embosomed in an oak wood that we did not see it till we were within fifty yards of the door i have seen the lago di garda albano de vico bolsena and geneva and upon my honour i prefer loughlomond to them all a preference which is certainly owing to the verdant islands that seem to float upon its surface affording the most inchanting objects of repose to the excursive view nor are the banks destitute of beauties which even partake of the sublime on this side they display a sweet variety of woodland cornfield and pasture with several agreeable villas emerging as it were out of the lake till at some distance the prospect terminates in huge mountains covered with heath which being in the bloom affords a very rich covering of purple every thing here is romantic beyond imagination this country is justly stiled the arcadia of scotland and i dont doubt but it may vie with arcadia in every thing but climatei am sure it excels it in verdure wood and waterwhat say you to a natural bason of pure water near thirty miles long and in some places seven miles broad and in many above a hundred fathom deep having four and twenty habitable islands some of them stocked with deer and all of them covered with wood containing immense quantities of delicious fish salmon pike trout perch flounders eels and powans the last a delicate kind of freshwater herring peculiar to this lake and finally communicating with the sea by sending off the leven through which all those species except the powan make their exit and entrance occasionally  inclosed i send you the copy of a little ode to this river by dr smollett who was born on the banks of it within two miles of the place where i am now writingit is at least picturesque and accurately descriptive if it has no other meritthere is an idea of truth in an agreeable landscape taken from nature which pleases me more than the gayest fiction which the most luxuriant fancy can display  i have other remarks to make but as my paper is full i must reserve them till the next occasion i shall only observe at present that i am determined to penetrate at least

within six or seven yards of the window it might have been placed in a higher site which would have afforded a more extensive prospect and a drier atmosphere but this imperfection is not chargeable on the present proprietor who purchased it ready built rather than be at the trouble of repairing his own familyhouse of bonhill which stands two miles from hence on the leven so surrounded with plantation that it used to be known by the name of the mavis or thrush nest above that house is a romantic glen or clift of a mountain covered with hanging woods having at bottom a stream of fine water that forms a number of cascades in its descent to join the leven so that the scene is quite enchanting a captain of a man of war who had made the circuit of the globe with mr anson being conducted to this glen exclaimed juan fernandez by god  indeed this country would be a perfect paradise if it was not like wales cursed with a weeping climate owing to the same cause in both the neighbourhood of high mountains and a westerly situation exposed to the vapours of the atlantic ocean this air however notwithstanding its humidity is so healthy that the natives are scarce ever visited by any other disease than the smallpox and certain cutaneous evils which are the effects of dirty living the great and general reproach of the commonalty of this kingdom here are a great many living monuments of longaevity and among the rest a person whom i treat with singular respect as a venerable druid who has lived near ninety years without pain or sickness among oaks of his own

perfection of content mr smollet calls him the admiral because he insists upon steering his pleasureboat upon the lake and he spends most of his time in ranging through the woods which he declares he enjoys as much as if they were still his own propertyi asked him the other day if he was never sick and he answered yes he had a slight fever the year before the union if he was not deaf i should take much pleasure in his conversation for he is very intelligent and his memory is surprisingly retentivethese are the happy effects of temperance exercise and good nature notwithstanding all his

fellow is far from being timorous in cases that are not supposed preternatural he could not stand the sight of this apparition but ran into the kitchen with his hair standing on end staring wildly and deprived of utterance mrs jenkins seeing him in this condition screamed aloud lord have mercy upon us he has seen something mrs tabitha was alarmed and the whole house in confusion when he was recruited with a dram i desired him to explain the meaning of all this agitation and with some reluctance he owned he had seen a spirit in the shape of an old man with a white beard a black cap and a plaid nightgown he was undeceived by the admiral in person who coming in at this juncture appeared to be a creature of real flesh and blood  do you know how we fare in this scottish paradise we make free with our landlords mutton which is excellent his poultryyard his garden his dairy and his cellar which are all well stored we have delicious salmon pike trout perch par c at the door for the taking the frith of clyde on the other side of the hill supplies us with mullet red and grey cod mackarel whiting and a variety of seafish including the finest fresh herrings i ever tasted we have sweet juicy beef and tolerable veal with delicate bread from the little town of dunbritton and plenty of partridge growse heath cock and other game in presents  we have been visited by all the gentlemen in the neighbourhood and they have entertained us at their houses not barely with hospitality but with such marks of cordial affection as one would wish to find among near relations after an absence of many years  i told you in my last i had projected an excursion to the highlands which project i have now happily executed under the auspices of sir george colquhoun a colonel in the dutch service who offered himself as our conductor on this occasion leaving our women at cameron to the care and inspection of lady h c we set out on horseback for inverary the county town of argyle and dined on the road with the laird of macfarlane the greatest genealogist i ever knew in any country and perfectly acquainted with all the antiquities of scotland  the duke of argyle has an old castle in inverary where he resides when he is in scotland and hard by is the shell of a noble gothic palace built by the last duke which when finished will be a great ornament to this part of the highlands as for inverary it is a place of very little importance  this country is amazingly wild especially towards the mountains which are heaped upon the backs of one another making a most stupendous appearance of savage nature with hardly any signs of cultivation or even of population all is sublimity silence and solitude the people live together in glens or bottoms where they are sheltered from the cold and storms of winter but there is a margin of plain ground spread along the sea side which is well inhabited and improved by the arts of husbandry and this i take to be one of the most agreeable tracts of the whole island the sea not only keeps it warm and supplies it with fish but affords one of the most ravishing prospects in the whole world i mean the appearance of the hebrides or western islands to the number of three hundred scattered as far as the eye can reach in the most agreeable confusion as the soil and climate of the highlands are but ill adapted to the cultivation of corn the people apply themselves chiefly to the breeding and feeding of black cattle which turn to good account those animals run wild all the winter without any shelter or subsistence but what they can find among the heath when the snow lies so deep and hard that they cannot penetrate to the roots of the grass they make a diurnal progress guided by a sure instinct to the seaside at low water where they feed on the alga marina and other plants that grow upon the beach  perhaps this branch of husbandry which required very little attendance and labour is one of the principal causes of that idleness and want of industry which distinguishes these mountaineers in their own country when they come forth into the world they become as diligent and alert as any people upon earth they are undoubtedly a very distinct species from their fellow subjects of the lowlands against whom they indulge an ancient spirit of animosity and this difference is very discernible even among persons of family and education the lowlanders are generally cool and circumspect the highlanders fiery and ferocious but this violence of their passions serves only to inflame the zeal of their devotion to strangers which is truly enthusiastic  we proceeded about twenty miles beyond inverary to the house of a gentleman a friend of our conductor where we stayed a few days and were feasted in such a manner that i began to dread the consequence to my constitution  notwithstanding the solitude that prevails among these mountains there is no want of people in the highlands i am credibly informed that the duke of argyle can assemble five thousand men in arms of his own clan and surname which is campbell and there is besides a tribe of the same appellation whose chief is the earl of breadalbine the macdonalds are as numerous and remarkably warlike the camerons mleods frasers grants mkenzies mkays mphersons mintoshes are powerful clans so that if all the highlanders including the inhabitants of the isles were united they could bring into the field an army of forty thousand fighting men capable of undertaking the most dangerous enterprize we have lived to see four thousand of them without discipline throw the whole kingdom of great britain into confusion they attacked and defeated two armies of regular troops accustomed to service they penetrated into the centre of england and afterwards marched back with deliberation in the face of two other armies through an enemys country where every precaution was taken to cut off their retreat i know not any other people in europe who without the use or knowledge of arms will attack regular forces sword in hand if their chief will head them in battle when disciplined they cannot fail of being excellent soldiers they do not walk like the generality of mankind but trot and bounce like deer as if they moved upon springs they greatly excel the lowlanders in all the exercises that require agility they are incredibly abstemious and patient of hunger and fatigueso steeled against the weather that in travelling even when the ground is covered with snow they never look for a house or any other shelter but their plaid in which they wrap themselves up and go to sleep under the cope of heaven such people in quality of soldiers must be invincible when the business is to perform quick marches in a difficult country to strike sudden strokes beat up the enemys quarters harrass their cavalry and perform expeditions without the formality of magazines baggage forage and artillery the chieftainship of the highlanders is a very dangerous influence operating at the extremity of the island where the eyes and hands of government cannot be supposed to see and act with precision and vigour in order to break the force of clanship administration has always practised the political maxim divide et impera the legislature hath not only disarmed these mountaineers but also deprived them of their antient garb which contributed in a great measure to keep up their military spirit and their slavish tenures are all dissolved by act of parliament so that they are at present as free and independent of their chiefs as the law can make them but the original attachment still remains and is founded on something prior to the feudal system about which the writers of this age have made such a pother as if it was a new discovery like the copernican system every peculiarity of policy custom and even temperament is affectedly traced to this origin as if the feudal constitution had not been common to almost all the natives of europe for my part i expect to see the use of trunkhose and buttered ale ascribed to the influence of the feudal system the connection between the clans and their chiefs is without all doubt patriarchal it is founded on hereditary regard and affection cherished through a long succession of ages the clan consider the chief as their father they bear his name they believe themselves descended from his family and they obey him as their lord with all the ardour of filial love and veneration while he on his part exerts a paternal authority commanding chastising rewarding protecting and maintaining them as his own children if the legislature would entirely destroy this connection it must compel the highlanders to change their habitation and their names even this experiment has been formerly tried without successin the reign of james vi a battle was fought within a few short miles of this place between two clans the mgregors and the colquhouns in which the latter were defeated the laird of mgregor made such a barbarous use of his victory that he was forfeited and outlawed by act of parliament his lands were given to the family of montrose and his clan were obliged to change their name they obeyed so far as to call themselves severally campbell graham or drummond the surnames of the families of argyle montrose and perth that they might enjoy the protection of those houses but they still added mgregor to their new appellation and as their chief was deprived of his estate they robbed and plundered for his subsistencemr cameron of lochiel the chief of that clan whose father was attainted for having been concerned in the last rebellion returning from france in obedience to a proclamation and act of parliament passed at the beginning of the late war payed a visit to his own country and hired a farm in the neighbourhood of his fathers house which had been burnt to the ground the clan though ruined and scattered no sooner heard of his arrival than they flocked to him from all quarters to welcome his return and in a few days stocked his farm with seven hundred black cattle which they had saved in the general wreck of their affairs but their beloved chief who was a promising youth did not live to enjoy the fruits of their fidelity and attachment  the most effectual method i know to weaken and at length destroy this influence is to employ the commonalty in such a manner as to give them a taste of property and independence in vain the government grants them advantageous leases on the forfeited estates if they have no property to prosecute the means of improvementthe sea is an inexhaustible fund of riches but the fishery cannot be carried on without vessels casks salt lines nets and other tackle i conversed with a sensible man of this country who from a real spirit of patriotism had set up a fishery on the coast and a manufacture of coarse linen for the employment of the poor highlanders cod is here in such plenty that he told me he had seen several hundred taken on one line at one hawlit must be observed however that the line was of immense length and had two thousand hooks baited with muscles but the fish was so superior to the cod caught on the banks of newfoundland that his correspondent at lisbon sold them immediately at his own price although lent was just over when they arrived and the people might be supposed quite cloyed with this kind of diethis linen manufacture was likewise in a prosperous way when the late war intervening all his best hands were pressed into the service  it cannot be expected that the gentlemen of this country should execute commercial schemes to render their vassals independent nor indeed are such schemes suited to their way of life and inclination but a company of merchants might with proper management turn to good account a fishery established in this part of scotlandour people have a strange itch to colonize america when the uncultivated parts of our own island might be settled to greater advantage  after having rambled through the mountains and glens of argyle we visited the adjacent islands of ila jura mull and icomkill in the first we saw the remains of a castle built in a lake where macdonald lord or king of the isles formerly resided jura is famous for having given birth to one mackcrain who lived one hundred and eighty years in one house and died in the reign of charles the second mull affords several bays where there is safe anchorage in one of which the florida a ship of the spanish armada was blown up by one of mr smolletts ancestorsabout forty years ago john duke of argyle is said to have consulted the spanish registers by which it appeared that this ship had the military chest on boardhe employed experienced divers to examine the wreck and they found the hull of the vessel still entire but so covered with sand that they could not make their way between decks however they picked up several pieces of plate that were scattered about in the bay and a couple of fine brass cannon  icolmkill or iona is a small island which st columba chose for his habitationit was respected for its sanctity and college or seminary of ecclesiasticspart of its church is still standing with the tombs of several scottish irish and danish sovereigns who were here interredthese islanders are very bold and dexterous watermen consequently the better adapted to the fishery in their manners they are less savage and impetuous than their countrymen on the continent and they speak the erse or gaelick in its greatest purity  having sent round our horses by land we embarked in the distinct of cowal for greenock which is a neat little town on the other side of the frith with a curious harbour formed by three stone jetties carried out a good way into the seanewportglasgow is such another place about two miles higher up both have a face of business and plenty and are supported entirely by the shipping of glasgow of which i counted sixty large vessels in these harbourstaking boat again at newport we were in less than an hour landed on the other side within two short miles of our headquarters where we found our women in good health and spirits they had been two days before joined by mr smollett and his lady to whom we have such obligations as i cannot mention even to you without blushing  tomorrow we shall bid adieu to the scotch arcadia and begin our progress to the southward taking our way by lanerk and nithsdale to the west borders of england i have received so much advantage and satisfaction from this tour that if my health suffers no revolution in the winter i believe i shall be tempted to undertake another expedition to the northern extremity of caithness unencumbered by those impediments which now clog the heels of  yours matt

goods and coming to pay his respects to our family has undertaken to deliver this letter into your own handwe have been six weeks in scotland and seen the principal towns of the kingdom where we have been treated with great civilitythe people are very courteous and the country being exceedingly romantic suits my turn and inclinationsi contracted some friendships at edinburgh which is a large and lofty city full of gay company and in particular commenced an intimate correspondence with one miss rtn an amiable young lady of my own age whose charms seemed to soften and even to subdue the stubborn heart of my brother jery but he no sooner left the place than he relapsed into his former insensibilityi feel however that this indifference is not the family constitutioni never admitted but one idea of love and that has taken such root in my heart as to be equally proof against all the pulls of discretion and the frosts of neglect  dear letty i had an alarming adventure at the hunters ball in edinburghwhile i sat discoursing with a friend in a corner all at once the very image of wilson stood before me dressed exactly as he was in the character of aimwell it was one mr gordon whom i had not seen beforeshocked at the sudden apparition i fainted away and threw the whole assembly in confusionhowever the cause of my disorder remained a secret to every body but my brother who was likewise struck with the resemblance and scolded after we came homei am very sensible of jerys affection and know he spoke as well with a view to my own interest and happiness as in regard to the honour of the family but i cannot bear to have my wounds probed severelyi was not so much affected by the censure he passed upon my own indiscretion as with the reflection he made on the conduct of wilson he observed that if he was really the gentleman he pretended to be and harboured nothing but honourable designs he would have vindicated his pretensions in the face of daythis remark made a deep impression upon my mindi endeavoured to conceal my thoughts and this endeavour had a bad effect upon my health and spirits so it was thought necessary that i should go to the highlands and drink the goatmilkwhey  we went accordingly to lough lomond one of the most enchanting spots in the whole world and what with this remedy which i had every morning fresh from the mountains and the pure air and chearful company i have recovered my flesh and appetite though there is something still at bottom which it is not in the power of air exercise company or medicine to removethese incidents would not touch me so nearly if i had a sensible confidant to sympathize with my affliction and comfort me with wholesome advicei have nothing of this kind except win jenkins who is really a good body in the main but very ill qualified for such an officethe poor creature is weak in her nerves as well as in her understanding otherwise i might have known the true name and character of that unfortunate youthbut why do i call him unfortunate perhaps the epithet is more applicable to me for having listened to the false professions ofbut hold i have as yet no right and sure i have no inclination to believe any thing to the prejudice of his honourin that reflection i shall still exert my patience as for mrs jenkins she herself is really an object of compassionbetween vanity methodism and love her head is almost turned i should have more regard for her however if she had been more constant in the object of her affection but truly she aimed at conquest and flirted at the same time with my uncles footman humphrey clinker who is really a deserving young man and one dutton my brothers valet de chambre a debauched fellow who leaving win in the lurch ran away with another mans bride at berwick  my dear willis i am truly ashamed of my own sexwe complain of advantages which the men take of our youth inexperience insensibility and all that but i have seen enough to believe that our sex in general make it their business to ensnare the other and for this purpose employ arts which are by no means to be justifiedin point of constancy they certainly have nothing to reproach the male part of the creationmy poor aunt without any regard to her years and imperfections has gone to market with her charms in every place where she thought she had the least chance to dispose of her person which however hangs still heavy on her handsi am afraid she has used even religion as a decoy though it has not answered her expectationshe has been praying preaching and catechising among the methodists with whom this country abounds and pretends to have such manifestations and revelations as even clinker himself can hardly believe though the poor fellow is half crazy with enthusiasm as for jenkins she affects to take all her mistresss reveries for gospel she has also her heartheavings and motions of the spirit and god forgive me if i think uncharitably but all this seems to me to be downright hypocrisy and deceitperhaps indeed the poor girl imposes on herselfshe is generally in a flutter and is much subject to vapourssince we came to scotland she has seen apparitions and pretends to prophesyif i could put faith in all these supernatural visitations i should think myself abandoned of grace for i have neither seen heard nor felt anything of this nature although i endeavour to discharge the duties of religion with all the sincerity zeal and devotion that is in the power of  dear letty your ever affectionate lydia melford glasgow sept    we are so far on our return to

to let you know as i am still in the land of the living and yet i have been on the brink of the other world since i sent you my last letterwe went by sea to another kingdom called fife and coming back had like to have gone to pot in a stormwhat between the frite and sickness i thought i should have brought my heart up even mr clinker was not his own man for eight and forty hours after we got ashore it was well for some folks that we scaped drownding for mistress was very frexious and seemed but indifferently prepared for a change but thank god she was soon put in a better frame by the private exaltations of the reverend mr macrocodilewe afterwards churned to starling and grascow which are a kiple of handsome towns and then we went to a gentlemans house at loffloming which is a wonderful sea of fresh water with a power of hylands in the midst ontthey say as how it has ner a bottom and was made by a musician and truly i believe it for it is not in the coarse of natureit has got waves without wind fish without fins and a floating hyland and one of them is a crutchyard where the dead are buried and always before the person dies a bell rings of itself to give warning  o mary this is the land of congyrationthe bell knolled when we were therei saw lights and heard lamentationsthe gentleman our landlord has got another house which he was fain to quit on account of a mischievous ghost that would not suffer people to lie in their beds the fairies dwell in a hole of kairmann a mounting hard by and they steal away the good women that are in the straw if so be as how there ant a horshoe nailed to the door and i was shewn an ould vitch called elspath ringavey with a red petticoat bleared eyes and a mould of grey bristles on her sinthat she mought do me no harm i crossed her hand with a taster and bid her tell my fortune and she told me such things descriving mr clinker to a hairbut it shall neer be said that i minchioned a word of the matteras i was troubled with fits she advised me to bathe in the loff which was holy water and so i went in the morning to a private place along with the housemaid and we bathed in our birthday soot after the fashion of the country and behold whilst we dabbled in the loff sir george coon started up with a gun but we clapt our hands to our faces and passed by him to the place where we had left our smocksa civil gentleman would have turned his head another waymy comfit is he knew not which was which and as the saying is all cats in the dark are greywhilst we stayed at loffloming he and our two squires went three or four days churning among the wild men of the mountings a parcel of selvidges that lie in caves among the rocks devour young children speak velch but the vords are different our ladies would not part with mr clinker because he is so stout and so pyehouse that he fears neither man nor devils if so be as they dont take him by surpriseindeed he was once so flurried by an operition that he had like to have soundedhe made believe as if it had been the ould edmiral but the old edmiral could not have made his air to stand on end and his teeth to shatter but he said so in prudence that the ladies mought not be afeard miss liddy has been puny and like to go into a declinei doubt her pore art is too tinderbut the gotsfey has set her on her legs againyou nows gotsfey is mothers milk to a velch woman as for mistress blessed be god she ails nothingher stomick is good and she improves in grease and godliness but for all that she may have infections like other people and i believe she wouldnt be sorry to be called your ladyship whenever sir george thinks proper to ax the questionbut for my part whatever i may see or hear not a praticle shall ever pass the lips of  dear molly your loving friend win jenkins grasco sept    remember me as usual to sallwe are now coming home though not the nearest roadi do suppose i shall find the kitten a fine boar at my return     to sir watkin phillips bart at oxon  dear knight  once more i tread upon english ground which i like not the worse for the six weeks ramble i have made among the woods and mountains of caledonia no offence to the land of cakes where bannocks grow upon straw i never saw my uncle in such health and spirits as he now enjoys liddy is perfectly recovered and mrs tabitha has no reason to complain nevertheless i believe she was till yesterday inclined to give the whole scotch nation to the devil as a pack of insensible brutes upon whom her accomplishments had been displayed in vainat every place where we halted did she mount the stage and flourished her rusty arms without being able to make one conquest one of her last essays was against the heart of sir george colquhoun with whom she fought all the weapons more than twice overshe was grave and gay by turnsshe moralized and methodizedshe laughed and romped and danced and sung and sighed and ogled and lisped and fluttered and flatteredbut all was preaching to the desart the baronet being a wellbred man carried his civilities as far as she could in conscience expect and if evil tongues are to be believed some degrees farther but he was too much a veteran in gallantry as well as in war to fall into any ambuscade that she could lay for his affectionwhile we were absent in the highlands she practised also upon the laird of ladrishmore and even gave him the rendezvous in the wood of drumscailloch but the laird had such a reverend care of his own reputation that he came attended with the parson of the parish and nothing passed but spiritual communication after all these miscarriages our aunt suddenly recollected lieutenant lismahago whom ever since our first arrival at edinburgh she seemed to have utterly forgot but now she expressed her hopes of seeing him at dumfries according to his promise  we set out from glasgow by the way of lanerk the countytown of clydesdale in the neighbourhood of which the whole river clyde rushing down a steep rock forms a very noble and stupendous cascade next day we were obliged to halt in a small borough until the carriage which had received some damage should be repaired and here we met with an incident which warmly interested the benevolent spirit of mr brambleas we stood at the window of an inn that fronted the public prison a person arrived on horseback genteelly tho plainly dressed in a blue frock with his own hair cut short and a goldlaced hat upon his headalighting and giving his horse to the landlord he advanced to an old man who was at work in paving the street and accosted him in these words this is hard work for such an old man as youso saying he took the instrument out of his hand and began to thump the pavementafter a few strokes have you never a son said he to ease you of this labour yes an please your honour replied the senior i have three hopeful lads but at present they are out of the way honour not me cried the stranger but more becomes me to honour your grey hairs where are those sons you talk of the ancient paviour said his eldest son was a captain in the east indies and the youngest had lately inlisted as a soldier in hopes of prospering like his brother the gentleman desiring to know what was become of the second he wiped his eyes and owned he had taken upon him his old fathers debts for which he was now in the prison hard by  the traveller made three quick steps towards the jail then turning short tell me said he has that unnatural captain sent you nothing to relieve your distress call him not unnatural replied the other gods blessing be upon him he sent me a great deal of money but i made a bad use of it i lost it by being security for a gentleman that was my landlord and was stript of all i had in the world besides at that instant a young man thrusting out his head and neck between two iron bars in the prisonwindow exclaimed father father if my brother william is in life thats he i ami amcried the stranger clasping the old man in his arms and shedding a flood of tearsi am your son willy sure enough before the father who was quite confounded could make any return to this tenderness a decent old woman bolting out from the door of a poor habitation cried where is my bairn where is my dear willythe captain no sooner beheld her than he quitted his father and ran into her embrace  i can assure you my uncle who saw and heard every thing that passed was as much moved as any one of the parties concerned in this pathetic recognitionhe sobbed and wept and clapped his hands and hollowed and finally ran down into the street by this time the captain had retired with his parents and all the inhabitants of the place were assembled at the doormr bramble nevertheless pressed thro the crowd and entering the house captain said he i beg the favour of your acquaintance i would have travelled a hundred miles to see this affecting scene and i shall think myself happy if you and your parents will dine with me at the public house the captain thanked him for his kind invitation which he said he would accept with pleasure but in the mean time he could not think of eating or drinking while his poor brother was in trouble he forthwith deposited a sum equal to the debt in the hands of the magistrate who ventured to set his brother at liberty without farther process and then the whole family repaired to the inn with my uncle attended by the crowd the individuals of which shook their townsman by the hand while he returned their caresses without the least sign of pride or affectation  this honest favourite of fortune whose name was brown told my uncle that he had been bred a weaver and about eighteen years ago had from a spirit of idleness and dissipation enlisted as a soldier in the service of the eastindia company that in the course of duty he had the good fortune to attract the notice and approbation of lord clive who preferred him from one step to another till he attained the rank of captain and paymaster to the regiment in which capacities he had honestly amassed above twelve thousand pounds and at the peace resigned his commissionhe had sent several remittances to his father who received the first only consisting of one hundred pounds the second had fallen into the hands of a bankrupt and the third had been consigned to a gentleman of scotland who died before it arrived so that it still remained to be accounted for by his executors he now presented the old man with fifty pounds for his present occasions over and above bank notes for one hundred which he had deposited for his brothers releasehe brought along with him a deed ready executed by which he settled a perpetuity of fourscore pounds upon his parents to be inherited by their other two sons after their deceasehe promised to purchase a commission for his youngest brother to take the other as his own partner in a manufacture which he intended to set up to give employment and bread to the industrious and to give five hundred pounds by way of dower to his sister who had married a farmer in low circumstances finally he gave fifty pounds to the poor of the town where he was born and feasted all the inhabitants without exception  my uncle was so charmed with the character of captain brown that he drank his health three times successively at dinnerhe said he was proud of his acquaintance that he was an honour to his country and had in some measure redeemed human nature from the reproach of pride selfishness and ingratitudefor my part i was as much pleased with the modesty as with the filial virtue of this honest soldier who assumed no merit from his success and said very little of his own transactions though the answers he made to our inquiries were equally sensible and laconic mrs tabitha behaved very graciously to him until she understood that he was going to make a tender of his hand to a person of low estate who had been his sweetheart while he worked as a journeyman weaverour aunt was no sooner made acquainted with this design than she starched up her behaviour with a double proportion of reserve and when the company broke up she observed with a toss of her nose that brown was a civil fellow enough considering the lowness of his original but that fortune though she had mended his circumstances was incapable to raise his ideas which were still humble and plebeian  on the day that succeeded this adventure we went some miles out of our road to see drumlanrig a seat belonging to the duke of queensberry which appears like a magnificent palace erected by magic in the midst of a wildernessit is indeed a princely mansion with suitable parks and plantations rendered still more striking by the nakedness of the surrounding country which is one of the wildest tracts in all scotlandthis wildness however is different from that of the highlands for here the mountains instead of heath are covered with a fine green swarth affording pasture to innumerable flocks of sheep but the fleeces of this country called nithsdale are not comparable to the wool of galloway which is said to equal that of salisbury plain having passed the night at the castle of drumlanrig by invitation from the duke himself who is one of the best men that ever breathed we prosecuted our journey to dumfries a very elegant trading town near the borders of england where we found plenty of good provision and excellent wine at very reasonable prices and the accommodation as good in all respects as in any part of southbritain if i was confined to scotland for life i would chuse dumfries as the place of my residence here we made enquiries about captain lismahago of whom hearing no tidings we proceeded by the solway frith to carlisle you must know that the solway sands upon which travellers pass at low water are exceedingly dangerous because as the tide makes they become quick in different places and the flood rushes in so impetuously that the passengers are often overtaken by the sea and perish  in crossing these treacherous syrtes with a guide we perceived a drowned horse which humphry clinker after due inspection declared to be the very identical beast which mr lismahago rode when he parted with us at feltonbridge in northumberland this information which seemed to intimate that our friend the lieutenant had shared the fate of his horse affected us all and above all our aunt tabitha who shed salt tears and obliged clinker to pull a few hairs out of the dead horses tail to be worn in a ring as a remembrance of his master but her grief and ours was not of long duration for one of the first persons we saw in carlisle was the lieutenant in propria persona bargaining with a horsedealer for another steed in the yard of the inn where we alightedmrs bramble was the first that perceived him and screamed as if she had seen a ghost and truly at a proper time and place he might very well have passed for an inhabitant of another world for he was more meagre and grim than beforewe received him the more cordially for having supposed he had been drowned and he was not deficient in expressions of satisfaction at this meeting he told us he had enquired for us at dumfries and been informed by a travelling merchant from glasgow that we had resolved to return by the way of coldstream he said that in passing the sands without a guide his horse had knocked up and he himself must have perished if he had not been providentially relieved by a return postchaisehe moreover gave us to understand that his scheme of settling in his own country having miscarried he was so far on his way to london with a view to embark for northamerica where he intended to pass the rest of his days among his old friends the miamis and amuse himself in finishing the education of the son he had by his beloved squinkinacoosta  this project was by no means agreeable to our good aunt who expatiated upon the fatigues and dangers that would attend such a long voyage by sea and afterwards such a tedious journey by landshe enlarged particularly on the risque he would run with respect to the concerns of his precious soul among savages who had not yet received the glad tidings of salvation and she hinted that his abandoning greatbritain might perhaps prove fatal to the inclinations of some deserving person whom he was qualified to make happy for life my uncle who is really a don quixote in generosity understanding that lismahagos real reason for leaving scotland was the impossibility of subsisting in it with any decency upon the wretched provision of a subalterns halfpay began to be warmly interested on the side of compassionhe thought it very hard that a gentleman who had served his country with honour should be driven by necessity to spend his old age among the refuse of mankind in such a remote part of the worldhe discoursed with me upon the subject observing that he would willingly offer the lieutenant an asylum at brambletonhall if he did not foresee that his singularities and humour of contradiction would render him an intolerable housemate though his conversation at some times might be both instructive and entertaining but as there seemed to be something particular in his attention to mrs tabitha he and i agreed in opinion that this intercourse should be encouraged and improved if possible into a matrimonial union in which case there would be a comfortable provision for both and they might be settled in a house of their own so that mr bramble should have no more of their company than he desired  in pursuance of this design lismahago has been invited to pass the winter at brambletonhall as it will be time enough to execute his american project in the springhe has taken time to consider of this proposal mean while he will keep us company as far as we travel in the road to bristol where he has hopes of getting a passage for america i make no doubt but that he will postpone his voyage and prosecute his addresses to a happy consummation and sure if it produces any fruit it must be of a very peculiar flavour as the weather continues favourable i believe we shall take the peak of derbyshire and buxton wells in our wayat any rate from the first place where we make any stay you shall hear again from  yours always j melford carlisle sep        to dr lewis  dear doctor  the peasantry of scotland are certainly on a poor footing all over the kingdom and yet they look better and are better cloathed than those of the same rank in burgundy and many other places of france and italy nay i will venture to say they are better fed notwithstanding the boasted wine of these foreign countries the country people of northbritain live chiefly on oatmeal and milk cheese butter and some gardenstuff with now and then a pickledherring by way of delicacy but fleshmeat they seldom or never taste nor any kind of strong liquor except twopenny at times of uncommon festivitytheir breakfast is a kind of hasty pudding of oatmeal or peasemeal eaten with milk they have commonly pottage for dinner composed of cale or cole leeks barley or big and butter and this is reinforced with bread and cheese made of skimmedmilkat night they sup on sowens or flummery of oatmealin a scarcity of oats they use the meal of barley and pease which is both nourishing and palatable some of them have potatoes and you find parsnips in every peasants gardenthey are cloathed with a coarse kind of russet of their own making which is both decent and warmthey dwell in poor huts built of loose stones and turf without any mortar having a fireplace or hearth in the middle generally made of an old millstone and a hole at top to let out the smoke  these people however are content and wonderfully sagaciousall of them read the bible and are even qualified to dispute upon the articles of their faith which in those parts i have seen is entirely presbyterian i am told that the inhabitants of aberdeenshire are still more acute i once knew a scotch gentleman at london who had declared war against this part of his countrymen and swore that the impudence and knavery of the scots in that quarter had brought a reproach upon the whole nation  the river clyde above glasgow is quite pastoral and the banks of it are every where adorned with fine villas from the sea to its source we may reckon the seats of many families of the first rank such as the duke of argyle at roseneath the earl of bute in the isle of that name the earl of glencairn at finlayston lord blantyre at areskine the dutchess of douglas at bothwell duke hamilton at hamilton the duke of douglas at douglas and the earl of hyndford at carmichael hamilton is a noble palace magnificently furnished and hard by is the village of that name one of the neatest little towns i have seen in any country the old castle of douglas being burned to the ground by accident the late duke resolved as head of the first family of scotland to have the largest house in the kingdom and ordered a plan for this purpose but there was only one wing of it finished when he died it is to be hoped that his nephew who is now in possession of his great fortune will complete the design of his predecessorclydesdale is in general populous and rich containing a great number of gentlemen who are independent in their fortune but it produces more cattle than cornthis is also the case with tweedale through part of which we passed and nithsdale which is generally rough wild and mountainousthese hills are covered with sheep and this is the small delicious mutton so much preferable to that of the londonmarket as their feeding costs so little the sheep are not killed till five years old when their flesh juices and flavour are in perfection but their fleeces are much damaged by the tar with which they are smeared to preserve them from the rot in winter during which they run wild night and day and thousands are lost under huge wreaths of snowtis pity the farmers cannot contrive some means to shelter this useful animal from the inclemencies of a rigorous climate especially from the perpetual rains which are more prejudicial than the greatest extremity of cold weather  on the little river nid is situated the castle of drumlanrig one of the noblest seats in greatbritain belonging to the duke of queensberry one of those few noblemen whose goodness of heart does honour to humannaturei shall not pretend to enter into a description of this palace which is really an instance of the sublime in magnificence as well as in situation and puts one in mind of the beautiful city of palmyra rising like a vision in the midst of the wilderness his grace keeps open house and lives with great splendourhe did us the honour to receive us with great courtesy and detaind us all night together with above twenty other guests with all their servants and horses to a very considerable numberthe dutchess was equally gracious and took our ladies under her immediate protection the longer i live i see more reason to believe that prejudices of education are never wholly eradicated even when they are discovered to be erroneous and absurd such habits of thinking as interest the grand passions cleave to the human heart in such a manner that though an effort of reason may force them from their hold for a moment this violence no sooner ceases than they resume their grasp with an increased elasticity and adhesion  i am led into this reflection by what passed at the dukes table after supper the conversation turned upon the vulgar notions of spirits and omens that prevail among the commonalty of northbritain and all the company agreed that nothing could be more ridiculous one gentleman however told a remarkable story of himself by way of speculation being on a party of hunting in the north said he i resolved to visit an old friend whom i had not seen for twenty yearsso long he had been retired and sequestered from all his acquaintance and lived in a moping melancholy way much afflicted with lowness of spirits occasioned by the death of his wife whom he had loved with uncommon affection as he resided in a remote part of the country and we were five gentlemen with as many servants we carried some provision with us from the next market town lest we should find him unprepared for our reception the roads being bad we did not arrive at the house till two oclock in the afternoon and were agreeably surprised to find a very good dinner ready in the kitchen and the cloth laid with six covers my friend himself appeared in his best apparel at the gate and received us with open arms telling me he had been expecting us these two hours astonished at this declaration i asked who had given him intelligence of our coming and he smiled without making any other reply however presuming upon our former intimacy i afterwards insisted upon knowing and he told me very gravely he had seen me in a vision of the second sightnay he called in the evidence of his steward who solemnly declared that his master had the day before apprised him of my coming with four other strangers and ordered him to provide accordingly in consequence of which intimation he had prepared the dinner which we were now eating and laid the covers according to the number foretold the incident we all owned to be remarkable and i endeavoured to account for it by natural means i observed that as the gentleman was of a visionary turn the casual idea or remembrance of his old friend might suggest those circumstances which accident had for once realized but that in all probability he had seen many visions of the same kind which were never verified none of the company directly dissented from my opinion but from the objections that were hinted i could plainly perceive that the majority were persuaded there was something more extraordinary in the case  another gentleman of the company addressing himself to me without all doubt said he a diseased imagination is very apt to produce visions but we must find some other method to account for something of this kind that happened within these eight days in my neighbourhooda gentleman of a good family who cannot be deemed a visionary in any sense of the word was near his own gate in the twilight visited by his grandfather who has been dead these fifteen yearsthe spectre was mounted seemingly on the very horse he used to ride with an angry and terrible countenance and said something which his grandson in the confusion of fear could not understand but this was not allhe lifted up a huge horse whip and applied it with great violence to his back and shoulders on which i saw the impression with my own eyes the apparition was afterwards seen by the sexton of the parish hovering about the tomb where his body lies interred as the man declared to several persons in the village before he knew what had happened to the gentlemannay he actually came to me as a justice of the peace in order to make oath of these particulars which however i declined administering as for the grandson of the defunct he is a sober sensible worldly minded fellow too intent upon schemes of interest to give in to reveries he would have willingly concealed the affair but he bawled out in the first transport of his fear and running into the house exposed his back and his sconce to the whole family so that there was no denying it in the sequel it is now the common discourse of the country that this appearance and behaviour of the old mans spirit portends some great calamity to the family and the goodwoman has actually taken to her bed in this apprehension  though i did not pretend to explain this mystery i said i did not at all doubt but it would one day appear to be a deception and in all probability a scheme executed by some enemy of the person who had sustained the assault but still the gentleman insisted upon the clearness of the evidence and the concurrence of testimony by which two creditable witnesses without any communication one with another affirmed the appearance of the same man with whose person they were both well acquaintedfrom drumlanrig we pursued the course of the nid to dumfries which stands seven miles above the place where the river falls into the sea and is after glasgow the handsomest town i have seen in scotland the inhabitants indeed seem to have proposed that city as their model not only in beautifying their town and regulating its police but also in prosecuting their schemes of commerce and manufacture by which they are grown rich and opulent  we reentered england by the way of carlisle where we accidentally met with our friend lismahago whom we had in vain inquired after at dumfries and other placesit would seem that the captain like the prophets of old is but little honoured in his own country which he has now renounced for everhe gave me the following particulars of his visit to his native soilin his way to the place of his nativity he learned that his nephew had married the daughter of a burgeois who directed a weaving manufacture and had gone into partnership with his fatherinlaw chagrined with this information he had arrived at the gate in the twilight where he heard the sound of treddles in the great hall which had exasperated him to such a degree that he had like to have lost his senses while he was thus transported with indignation his nephew chanced to come forth when being no longer master of his passion he cried degenerate rascal you have made my fathers house a den of thieves and at the same time chastised him with his horsewhip then riding round the adjoining village he had visited the buryingground of his ancestors by moonlight and having paid his respects to their manes travelled all night to another part of the countryfinding the head of the family in such a disgraceful situation all his own friends dead or removed from the places of their former residence and the expence of living increased to double of what it had been when he first left his native country he had bid it an eternal adieu and was determined to seek for repose among the forests of america  i was no longer at a loss to account for the apparition which had been described at drumlanrig and when i repeated the story to the lieutenant he was much pleased to think his resentment had been so much more effectual than he intended and he owned he might at such an hour and in such an equipage very well pass for the ghost of his father whom he was said greatly to resemblebetween friends i fancy lismahago will find a retreat without going so far as the wigwams of the miamis my sister tabby is making continual advances to him in the way of affection and if i may trust to appearances the captain is disposed to take opportunity by the forelock for my part i intend to encourage this correspondence and shall be glad to see them unitedin that case we shall find a way to settle them comfortably in our own neighbourhood i and my servants will get rid of a very troublesome and tyrannic gouvernante and i shall have the benefit of lismahagos conversation without being obliged to take more of his company than i desire for though an olla is a highflavoured dish i could not bear to dine upon it every day of my life  i am much pleased with manchester which is one of the most agreeable and flourishing towns in greatbritain and i perceive that this is the place which hath animated the spirit and suggested the chief manufactures of glasgow we propose to visit chatsworth the peak and buxton from which last place we shall proceed directly homewards though by easy journies if the season has been as favourable in wales as in the north your harvest is happily finished and we have nothing left to think of but our october of which let barns be properly reminded you will find me much better in flesh than i was at our parting and this short separation has given a new edge to those sentiments of friendship with which i always have been and ever shall be  yours matt bramble manchester sept        to mrs gwillim housekeeper at brambletonhall  mrs gwyllim  it has pleased providence to bring us safe back to england and partake us in many pearls by land and water in particular the devils harse a pike and hoydens hole which hath got no bottom and as we are drawing huomwards it may be proper to uprise you that brambletonhall may be in condition to receive us after this long gurney to the islands of scotland by the first of next month you may begin to make constant fires in my brothers chamber and mine and burn a fagget every day in the yellow damask room have the tester and curtains dusted and the featherbed and matrosses well haired because perhaps with the blissing of haven they may be yoosed on some occasion let the ould hogsheads be well skewred and seasoned for bear as mat is resolved to have his seller choak fool  if the house was mine i would turn over a new leafi dont see why the sarvants of wales shouldnt drink fair water and eat hot cakes and barley cale as they do in scotland without troubling the botcher above once a quarteri hope you keep accunt of rogers purseeding in reverence to the buttermilk i expect my dew when i come huom without baiting an ass ill assure youas you must have layed a great many more eggs than would be eaten i do suppose there is a power of turks chickings and guzzling

thorough cleaning from top to bottom for the honour of wales and let roger search into and make a general clearance of the slit holes which the maids have in secret for i know they are much given to sloth and uncleanness i hope you have worked a reformation among them as i exhorted you in my last and set their hearts upon better things than they can find in junkitting and caterwauling with the fellows of the country  as for win jenkins she has undergone a perfect metamurphysis and is become a new creeter from the ammunition of humphry clinker our new footman a pious young man who has laboured exceedingly that she may bring forth fruits of repentance i make no doubt but he will take the same pains with that pert hussey mary jones and all of you and that he may have power given to penetrate and instill his goodness even into your most inward parts is the fervent prayer of  your friend in the spirit tab bramble septr        to dr lewis  dear lewis  lismahago is more paradoxical than everthe late gulp he had of his native air seems to have blown fresh spirit into all his polemical faculties i congratulated him the other day on the present flourishing state of his country observing that the scots were now in a fair way to wipe off the national reproach of poverty and expressing my satisfaction at the happy effects of the union so conspicuous in the improvement of their agriculture commerce manufactures and mannersthe lieutenant screwing up his features into a look of dissent and disgust commented on my remarks to this effectthose who reproach a nation for its poverty when it is not owing to the profligacy or vice of the people deserve no answer the lacedaemonians were poorer than the scots when they took the lead among all the free states of greece and were esteemed above them all for their valour and their virtue the most respectable heroes of ancient rome such as fabricius cincinnatus and regulus were poorer than the poorest freeholder in scotland and there are at this day individuals in northbritain one of whom can produce more gold and silver than the whole republic of rome could raise at those times when her public virtue shone with unrivalled lustre and poverty was so far from being a reproach that it added fresh laurels to her fame because it indicated a noble contempt of wealth which was proof against all the arts of corruptionif poverty be a subject for reproach it follows that wealth is the object of esteem and venerationin that case there are jews and others in amsterdam and london enriched by usury peculation and different species of fraud and extortion who are more estimable than the most virtuous and illustrious members of the community an absurdity which no man in his senses will offer to maintainriches are certainly no proof of merit nay they are often if not most commonly acquired by persons of sordid minds and mean talents nor do they give any intrinsic worth to the possessor but on the contrary tend to pervert his understanding and render his morals more depraved but granting that poverty were really matter of reproach it cannot be justly imputed to scotland no country is poor that can supply its inhabitants with the necessaries of life and even afford articles for exportation scotland is rich in natural advantages it produces every species of provision in abundance vast herds of cattle and flocks of sheep with a great number of horses prodigious quantities of wool and flax with plenty of copse wood and in some parts large forests of timber the earth is still more rich below than above the surface it yields inexhaustible stores of coal freestone marble lead iron copper and silver with some gold the sea abounds with excellent fish and salt to cure them for exportation and there are creeks and harbours round the whole kingdom for the convenience and security of navigation the face of the country displays a surprising number of cities towns villas and villages swarming with people and there seems to be no want of art industry government and police such a kingdom can never be called poor in any sense of the word though there may be many others more powerful and opulent but the proper use of those advantages and the present prosperity of the scots you seem to derive from the union of the two kingdoms  i said i supposed he would not deny that the appearance of the country was much mended that the people lived better had more trade and a greater quantity of money circulating since the union than before i may safely admit these premises answered the lieutenant without subscribing to your inference the difference you mention i should take to be the natural progress of improvementsince that period other nations such as the swedes the danes and in particular the french have greatly increased in commerce without any such cause assigned before the union there was a remarkable spirit of trade among the scots as appeared in the case of their darien company in which they had embarked no less than four hundred thousand pounds sterling and in the flourishing state of the maritime towns in fife and on the eastern coast enriched by their trade with france which failed in consequence of the union the only solid commercial advantage reaped from that measure was the privilege of trading to the english plantations yet excepting glasgow and dumfries i dont know any other scotch towns concerned in that traffick in other respects i conceive the scots were losers by the unionthey lost the independency of their state the greatest prop of national spirit they lost their parliament and their courts of justice were subjected to the revision and supremacy of an english tribunal  softly captain cried i you cannot be said to have lost your own parliament while you are represented in that of greatbritain true said he with a sarcastic grin in debates of national competition the sixteen peers and fortyfive commoners of scotland must make a formidable figure in the scale against the whole english legislature be that as it may i observed while i had the honour to sit in the lower house the scotch members had always the majority on their side i understand you sir said he they generally side with the majority so much the worse for their constituents but even this evil is not the worst they have sustained by the union their trade has been saddled with grievous impositions and every article of living severely taxed to pay the interest of enormous debts contracted by the english in support of measures and connections in which the scots had no interest nor concern i begged he would at least allow that by the union the scots were admitted to all the privileges and immunities of english subjects by which means multitudes of them were provided for in the army and navy and got fortunes in different parts of england and its dominions all these said he become english subjects to all intents and purposes and are in a great measure lost to their mothercountry the spirit of rambling and adventure has been always peculiar to the natives of scotland if they had not met with encouragement in england they would have served and settled as formerly in other countries such as muscovy sweden denmark poland germany france piedmont and italy in all which nations their descendants continue to flourish even at this day  by this time my patience began to fail and i exclaimed for gods sake what has england got by this union which you say has been so productive of misfortune to the scots great and manifold are the advantages which england derives from the union said lismahago in a solemn tone first and foremost the settlement of the protestant succession a point which the english ministry drove with such eagerness that no stone was left unturned to cajole and bribe a few leading men to cram the union down the throats of the scottish nation who were surprisingly averse to the expedient they gained by it a considerable addition of territory extending their dominion to the sea on all sides of the island thereby shutting up all backdoors against the enterprizes of their enemies they got an accession of above a million of useful subjects constituting a neverfailing nursery of seamen soldiers labourers and mechanics a most valuable acquisition to a trading country exposed to foreign wars and obliged to maintain a number of settlements in all the four quarters of the globe in the course of seven years during the last war scotland furnished the english army and navy with seventy thousand men over and above those who migrated to their colonies or mingled with them at home in the civil departments of life this was a very considerable and seasonable supply to a nation whose people had been for many years decreasing in number and whose lands and manufactures were actually suffering for want of hands i need not remind you of the hackneyed maxim that to a nation in such circumstances a supply of industrious people is a supply of wealth nor repeat an observation which is now received as an eternal truth even among the english themselves that the scots who settle in southbritain are remarkably sober orderly and industrious  i allowed the truth of this remark adding that by their industry oeconomy and circumspection many of them in england as well as in her colonies amassed large fortunes with which they returned to their own country and this was so much lost to southbritaingive me leave sir said he to assure you that in your fact you are mistaken and in your deduction erroneous not one in two hundred that leave scotland ever returns to settle in his own country and the few that do return carry thither nothing that can possibly diminish the stock of southbritain for none of their treasure stagnates in scotlandthere is a continual circulation like that of the blood in the human body and england is the heart to which all the streams which it distributes are refunded and returned nay in consequence of that luxury which our connexion with england hath greatly encouraged if not introduced all the produce of our lands and all the profits of our trade are engrossed by the natives of southbritain for you will find that the exchange between the two kingdoms is always against scotland and that she retains neither gold nor silver sufficient for her own circulationthe scots not content with their own manufactures and produce which would very well answer all necessary occasions seem to vie with each other in purchasing superfluities from england such as broadcloth velvets stuffs silks lace furs jewels furniture of all sorts sugar rum tea chocolate and coffee in a word not only every mode of the most extravagant luxury but even many articles of convenience which they might find as good and much cheaper in their own country for all these particulars i conceive england may touch about one million sterling ayeari dont pretend to make an exact calculation perhaps it may be something less and perhaps a great deal more the annual revenue arising from all the private estates of scotland cannot fall short of a million sterling and i should imagine their trade will amount to as much morei know the linen manufacture alone returns near half a million exclusive of the homeconsumption of that articleif therefore northbritain pays a ballance of a million annually to england i insist upon it that country is more valuable to her in the way of commerce than any colony in her possession over and above the other advantages which i have specified therefore they are no friends either to england or to truth who affect to depreciate the northern part of the united kingdom  i must own i was at first a little nettled to find myself schooled in so many particularsthough i did not receive all his assertions as gospel i was not prepared to refute them and i cannot help now acquiescing in his remarks so far as to think that the contempt for scotland which prevails too much on this side the tweed is founded on prejudice and errorafter some recollection well captain said i you have argued stoutly for the importance of your own country for my part i have such a regard for our fellowsubjects of northbritain that i shall be glad to see the day when your peasants can afford to give all their oats to their cattle hogs and poultry and indulge themselves with good wheaten loaves instead of such poor unpalatable and inflammatory diet here again i brought my self into a premunire with the disputative caledonian he said he hoped he should never see the common people lifted out of that sphere for which they were intended by nature and the course of things that they might have some reason to complain of their bread if it were mixed like that of norway with saw dust and fishbones but that oatmeal was he apprehended as nourishing and salutary as wheatflour and the scots in general thought it at least as savouryhe affirmed that a mouse which in the article of selfpreservation might be supposed to act from infallible instinct would always prefer oats to wheat as appeared from experience for in a place where there was a parcel of each that animal has never begun to feed upon the latter till all the oats were consumed for their nutritive quality he appealed to the hale robust constitutions of the people who lived chiefly upon oatmeal and instead of being inflammatory he asserted that it was a cooling subacid balsamic and mucilaginous insomuch that in all inflammatory distempers recourse was had to watergruel and flummery made of oatmeal  at least said i give me leave to wish them such a degree of commerce as may enable them to follow their own inclinationsheaven forbid cried this philosopher woe be to that nation where the multitude is at liberty to follow their own inclinations commerce is undoubtedly a blessing while restrained within its proper channels but a glut of wealth brings along with it a glut of evils it brings false taste false appetite false wants profusion venality contempt of order engendering a spirit of licentiousness insolence and faction that keeps the community in continual ferment and in time destroys all the distinctions of civil society so that universal anarchy and uproar must ensue will any sensible man affirm that the national advantages of opulence are to be sought on these terms no sure but i am one of those who think that by proper regulations commerce may produce every national benefit without the allay of such concomitant evils  so much for the dogmata of my friend lismahago whom i describe the more circumstantially as i firmly believe he will set up his rest in monmouthshire yesterday while i was alone with him he asked in some confusion if i should have any objection to the success of a gentleman and a soldier provided he should be so fortunate as to engage my sisters affection i answered without hesitation that my sister was old enough to judge for herself and that i should be very far from disapproving any resolution she might take in his favourhis eyes sparkled at this declaration he declared he should think himself the happiest man on earth to be connected with my family and that he should never be weary of giving me proofs of his gratitude and attachment i suppose tabby and he are already agreed in which case we shall have a wedding at brambletonhall and you shall give away the brideit is the least thing you can do by way of atonement for your former cruelty to that poor lovesick maiden who has been so long a thorn in the side of   yours matt bramble sept  0  we have been at buxton but as i did not much relish either the company or the accommodations and had no occasion for the water we stayed but two nights in the place     to sir watkin phillips bart of jesus college oxon  dear wat  adventures begin to thicken as we advance to the southward lismahago has now professed himself the admirer of our aunt and carries on his addresses under the sanction of her brothers approbation so that we shall certainly have a wedding by christmas i should be glad you was present at the nuptials to help me throw the stocking and perform other ceremonies peculiar to that occasioni am sure it will be productive of some diversion and truly it would be worth your while to come across the country on purpose to see two such original figures in bed together with their laced night caps he the emblem of good cheer and she the picture of good nature all this agreeable prospect was clouded and had well nigh vanished entirely in consequence of a late misunderstanding between the future brothersinlaw which however is now happily removed  a few days ago my uncle and i going to visit a relation met with lord oxmington at his house who asked us to dine with him next day and we accepted the invitationaccordingly leaving our women under the care of captain lismahago at the inn where we had lodged the preceding night in a little town about a mile from his lordships dwelling we went at the hour appointed and had a fashionable meal served up with much ostentation to a company of about a dozen persons none of whom he had ever seen beforehis lordship is much more remarkable for his pride and caprice than for his hospitality and understanding and indeed it appeared that he considered his guests merely as objects to shine upon so as to reflect the lustre of his own magnificencethere was much state but no courtesy and a great deal of compliment without any conversationbefore the desert was removed our noble entertainer proposed three general toasts then calling for a glass of wine and bowing all round wished us a good afternoon this was the signal for the company to break up and they obeyed it immediately all except our squire who was greatly shocked at the manner of this dismissionhe changed countenance bit his lip in silence but still kept his seat so that his lordship found himself obliged to give us another hint by saying he should be glad to see us another time there is no time like the present cried mr bramble your lordship has not yet drank a bumper to the best in christendom ill drink no more bumpers today answered our landlord and i am sorry to see you have drank too manyorder the gentlemans carriage to the gateso saying he rose and retired abruptly our squire starting up at the same time laying his hand upon his sword and eyeing him with a most ferocious aspect the master having vanished in this manner our uncle bad one of the servants to see what was to pay and the fellow answering this is no inn i cry you mercy cried the other i perceive it is not if it were the landlord would be more civil theres a guinea however take it and tell your lord that i shall not leave the country till i have had the opportunity to thank him in person for his politeness and hospitality  we then walked down stairs through a double range of lacqueys and getting into the chaise proceeded homewards perceiving the squire much ruffled i ventured to disapprove of his resentment observing that as lord oxmington was well known to have his brain very ill timbered a sensible man should rather laugh than be angry at his ridiculous want of breedingmr bramble took umbrage at my presuming to be wiser than he upon this occasion and told me that as he had always thought for himself in every occurrence in life he would still use the same privilege with my good leave  when we returned to our inn he closeted lismahago and having explained his grievance desired that gentleman to go and demand satisfaction of lord oxmington in his namethe lieutenant charged himself with this commission and immediately set out a horseback for his lordships house attended at his own request by my man archy macalpine who had been used to military service and truly if macalpine had been mounted upon an ass this couple might have passed for the knight of la mancha and his squire panza it was not till after some demur that lismahago obtained a private audience at which he formally defied his lordship to single combat in the name of mr bramble and desired him to appoint the time and place lord oxmington was so confounded at this unexpected message that he could not for some time make any articulate reply but stood staring at the lieutenant with manifest marks of perturbation at length ringing a bell with great vehemence he exclaimed what a commoner send a challenge to a peer of the realmprivilege privilegeheres a person brings me a challenge from the welshman that dined at my tablean impudent fellowmy wine is not yet out of his head  the whole house was immediately in commotionmacalpine made a soldierly retreat with two horses but the captain was suddenly surrounded and disarmed by the footmen whom a french valet de chambre headed in this exploit his sword was passed through a closestool and his person through the horsepond in this plight he returned to the inn half mad with his disgrace so violent was the rage of his indignation that he mistook its objecthe wanted to quarrel with mr bramble he said he had been dishonoured on his account and he looked for reparation at his handsmy uncles back was up in a moment and he desired him to explain his pretensionseither compel lord oxmington to give me satisfaction cried he or give it me in your own person the latter part of the alternative is the most easy and expeditious replied the squire starting up if you are disposed for a walk ill attend you this moment  here they were interrupted by mrs tabby who had overheard all that passedshe now burst into the room and running betwixt them in great agitation is this your regard for me said she to the lieutenant to seek the life of my brother lismahago who seemed to grow cool as my uncle grew hot assured her he had a very great respect for mr bramble but he had still more for his own honour which had suffered pollution but if that could be once purified he should have no further cause of dissatisfaction the squire said he should have thought it incumbent upon him to vindicate the lieutenants honour but as he had now carved for himself he might swallow and digest it as well as he couldin a word what betwixt the mediation of mrs tabitha the recollection of the captain who perceived he had gone too far and the remonstrances of your humble servant who joined them at this juncture those two originals were perfectly reconciled and then we proceeded to deliberate upon the means of taking vengeance for the insults they had received from the petulant peer for until that aim should be accomplished mr bramble swore with great emphasis that he would not leave the inn where we now lodged even if he should pass his christmas on the spot  in consequence of our deliberations we next day in the forenoon proceeded in a body to his lordships house all of us with our servants including the coachman mounted ahorseback with our pistols loaded and ready primedthus prepared for action we paraded solemnly and slowly before his lordships gate which we passed three times in such a manner that he could not but see us and suspect the cause of our appearanceafter dinner we returned and performed the same cavalcade which was again repeated the morning following but we had no occasion to persist in these manoeuvres about noon we were visited by the gentleman at whose house we had first seen lord oxmingtonhe now came to make apologies in the name of his lordship who declared he had no intention to give offence to my uncle in practising what had been always the custom of his house and that as for the indignities which had been put upon the officer they were offered without his lordships knowledge at the instigation of his valet de chambreif that be the case said my uncle in a peremptory tone i shall be contented with lord oxmingtons personal excuses and i hope my friend will be satisfied with his lordships turning that insolent rascal out of his servicesir cried lismahago i must insist upon taking personal vengeance for the personal injuries i have sustained  after some debate the affair was adjusted in this mannerhis lordship meeting us at our friends house declared he was sorry for what had happened and that he had no intention to give umbragethe valet de chambre asked pardon of the lieutenant upon his knees when lismahago to the astonishment of all present gave him a violent kick on the face which laid him on his back exclaiming in a furious tone oui je te pardonne gens foutre  such was the fortunate issue of this perilous adventure which threatened abundance of vexation to our family for the squire is one of those who will sacrifice both life and fortune rather than leave what they conceive to be the least speck or blemish upon their honour and reputation his lordship had no sooner pronounced his apology with a very bad grace than he went away in some disorder and i dare say he will never invite another welchman to his table  we forthwith quitted the field of this atchievement in order to prosecute our journey but we follow no determinate course we make small deviations to see the remarkable towns villas and curiosities on each side of our route so that we advance by slow steps towards the borders of monmouthshire but in the midst of these irregular motions there is no abberration nor eccentricity in that affection with which i am dear wat   yours always j melford sept        to dr lewis  dear dick  at what time of life may a man think himself exempted from the necessity of sacrificing his repose to the punctilios of a contemptible world i have been engaged in a ridiculous adventure which i shall recount at meeting and this i hope will not be much longer delayed as we have now performed almost all our visits and seen every thing that i think has any right to retard us in our journey homewardsa few days ago understanding by accident that my old friend baynard was in the country i would not pass so near his habitation without paying him a visit though our correspondence had been interrupted for a long course of years  i felt my self very sensibly affected by the idea of our past intimacy as we approached the place where we had spent so many happy days together but when we arrived at the house i could not recognize any one of those objects which had been so deeply impressed upon my remembrancethe tall oaks that shaded the avenue had been cut down and the iron gates at the end of it removed together with the high wall that surrounded the court yard the house itself which was formerly a convent of cistercian monks had a venerable appearance and along the front that looked into the garden was a stone gallery which afforded me many an agreeable walk when i was disposed to be contemplative now the old front is covered with a screen of modern architecture so that all without is grecian and all within gothic as for the garden which was well stocked with the best fruit which england could produce there is not now the least vestage remaining of trees walls or hedgesnothing appears but a naked circus of loose sand with a dry bason and a leaden triton in the middle  you must know that baynard at his fathers death had a clear estate of fifteen hundred pounds ayear and was in other respects extremely well qualified to make a respectable figure in the commonwealth but what with some excesses of youth and the expence of a contested election he in a few years found himself encumbered with a debt of ten thousand pounds which he resolved to discharge by means of a prudent marriage he accordingly married a miss thomson whose fortune amounted to double the sum that he owedshe was the daughter of a citizen who had failed in trade but her fortune came by an uncle who died in the eastindiesher own parents being dead she lived with a maiden aunt who had superintended her education and in all appearance was well enough qualified for the usual purposes of the married stateher virtues however stood rather upon a negative than a positive foundationshe was neither proud insolent nor capricious nor given to scandal nor addicted to gaming nor inclined to gallantry she could read and write and dance and sing and play upon the harpsichord and smatter french and take a hand at whist and ombre but even these accomplishments she possessed by halvesshe excelled in nothing her conversation was flat her stile mean and her expression embarrassedin a word her character was totally insipid her person was not disagreeable but there was nothing graceful in her address nor engaging in her manners and she was so ill qualified to do the honours of the house that when she sat at the head of the table one was always looking for the mistress of the family in some other place  baynard had flattered himself that it would be no difficult matter to mould such a subject after his own fashion and that she would chearfully enter into his views which were wholly turned to domestic happiness he proposed to reside always in the country of which he was fond to a degree of enthusiasm to cultivate his estate which was very improvable to enjoy the exercise of rural diversions to maintain an intimacy of correspondence with some friends that were settled in his neighbourhood to keep a comfortable house without suffering his expence to exceed the limits of his income and to find pleasure and employ merit for his wife in the management and avocations of her own familythis however was a visionary scheme which he never was able to realize his wife was as ignorant as a newborn babe of everything that related to the conduct of a family and she had no idea of a countrylife her understanding did not reach so far as to comprehend the first principles of discretion and indeed if her capacity had been better than it was her natural indolence would not have permitted her to abandon a certain routine to which she had been habituated she had not taste enough to relish any rational enjoyment but her ruling passion was vanity not that species which arises from selfconceit of superior accomplishments but that which is of a bastard and idiot nature excited by shew and ostentation which implies not even the least consciousness of any personal merit  the nuptial peal of noise and nonsense being rung out in all the usual changes mr baynard thought it high time to make her acquainted with the particulars of the plan which he had projectedhe told her that his fortune though sufficient to afford all the comforts of life was not ample enough to command all the superfluities of pomp and pageantry which indeed were equally absurd and intolerablehe therefore hoped she would have no objection to their leaving london in the spring when he would take the opportunity to dismiss some unnecessary domestics whom he had hired for the occasion of their marriageshe heard him in silence and after some pause so said she i am to be buried in the country he was so confounded at this reply that he could not speak for some minutes at length he told her he was much mortified to find he had proposed anything that was disagreeable to her ideasi am sure added he i meant nothing more than to lay down a comfortable plan of living within the bounds of our fortune which is but moderate sir said she you are the best judge of your own affairsmy fortune i know does not exceed twenty thousand poundsyet even with that pittance i might have had a husband who would not have begrudged me a house in londongood god my dear cried poor baynard in the utmost agitation you dont think me so sordidi only hinted what i thoughtbut i dont pretend to impose yes sir resumed the lady it is your prerogative to command and my duty to obey so saying she burst into tears and retired to her chamber where she was joined by her aunthe endeavoured to recollect himself and act with vigour of mind on this occasion but was betrayed by the tenderness of his nature which was the greatest defect of his constitution he found the aunt in tears and the niece in a fit which held her the best part of eight hours at the expiration of which she began to talk incoherently about death and her dear husband who had sat by her all this time and now pressed her hand to his lips in a transport of grief and penitence for the offence he had givenfrom thence forward he carefully avoided mentioning the country and they continued to be sucked deeper and deeper into the vortex of extravagance and dissipation leading what is called a fashionable life in townabout the latter end of july however mrs baynard in order to exhibit a proof of conjugal obedience desired of her own accord that they might pay a visit to his country house as there was no company left in london he would have excused himself from this excursion which was no part of the oeconomical plan he had proposed but she insisted upon making this sacrifice to his taste and prejudices and away they went with such an equipage as astonished the whole country all that remained of the season was engrossed by receiving and returning visits in the neighbourhood and in this intercourse it was discovered that sir john chickwell had a housesteward and one footman in livery more than the complement of mr baynards household this remark was made by the aunt at table and assented to by the husband who observed that sir john chickwell might very well afford to keep more servants than were found in the family of a man who had not half his fortune mrs baynard ate no supper that evening but was seized with a violent fit which completed her triumph over the spirit of her consort the two supernumerary servants were addedthe family plate was sold for old silver and a new service procured fashionable furniture was provided and the whole house turned topsy turvy  at their return to london in the beginning of winter he with a heavy heart communicated these particulars to me in confidence before his marriage he had introduced me to the lady as his particular friend and i now offered in that character to lay before her the necessity of reforming her oeconomy if she had any regard to the interest of her own family or complaisance for the inclinations of her husbandbut baynard declined my offer on the supposition that his wifes nerves were too delicate to bear expostulation and that it would only serve to overwhelm her with such distress as would make himself miserable  baynard is a man of spirit and had she proved a termagant he would have known how to deal with her but either by accident or instinct she fastened upon the weak side of his soul and held it so fast that he has been in subjection ever sincei afterwards advised him to carry her abroad to france or italy where he might gratify her vanity for half the expence it cost him in england and this advice he followed accordingly she was agreeably flattered with the idea of seeing and knowing foreign parts and foreign fashions of being presented to sovereigns and living familiarly with princes she forthwith seized the hint which i had thrown out on purpose and even pressed mr baynard to hasten his departure so that in a few weeks they crossed the sea to france with a moderate train still including the aunt who was her bosom counsellor and abetted her in all her oppositions to her husbands willsince that period i have had little or no opportunity to renew our former correspondenceall that i knew of his transactions amounted to no more than that after an absence of two years they returned so little improved in oeconomy that they launched out into new oceans of extravagance which at length obliged him to mortgage his estateby this time she had bore him three children of which the last only survives a puny boy of twelve or thirteen who will be ruined in his education by the indulgence of his mother  as for baynard neither his own good sense nor the dread of indigence nor the consideration of his children has been of force sufficient to stimulate him into the resolution of breaking at once the shameful spell by which he seems enchantedwith a taste capable of the most refined enjoyment a heart glowing with all the warmth of friendship and humanity and a disposition strongly turned to the more rational pleasures of a retired and country life he is hurried about in a perpetual tumult amidst a mob of beings pleased with rattles baubles and gewgaws so void of sense and distinction that even the most acute philosopher would find it a very hard task to discover for what wise purpose of providence they were createdfriendship is not to be found nor can the amusements for which he sighs be enjoyed within the rotation of absurdity to which he is doomed for life he has long resigned all views of improving his fortune by management and attention to the exercise of husbandry in which he delighted and as to domestic happiness not the least glimpse of hope remains to amuse his imagination thus blasted in all his prospects he could not fail to be overwhelmed with melancholy and chagrin which have preyed upon his health and spirits in such a manner that he is now threatened with a consumption  i have given you a sketch of the man whom the other day i went to visitat the gate we found a great number of powdered lacquies but no civilityafter we had sat a considerable time in the coach we were told that mr baynard had rode out and that his lady was dressing but we were introduced to a parlour so very fine and delicate that in all appearance it was designed to be seen only not inhabited the chairs and couches were carved gilt and covered with rich damask so smooth and slick that they looked as if they had never been sat upon there was no carpet upon the floor but the boards were rubbed and waxed in such a manner that we could not walk but were obliged to slide along them and as for the stove it was too bright and polished to be polluted with seacoal or stained by the smoke of any gross material firewhen we had remained above half an hour sacrificing to the inhospitable powers in the temple of cold reception my friend baynard arrived and understanding we were in the house made his appearance so meagre yellow and dejected that i really should not have known him had i met with him in any other place running up to me with great eagerness he strained me in his embrace and his heart was so full that for some minutes he could not speak having saluted us all round he perceived our uncomfortable situation and conducting us into another apartment which had fire in the chimney called for chocolatethen withdrawing he returned with a compliment from his wife and in the mean time presented his son harry a shambling bleareyed boy in the habit of a hussar very rude forward and impertinent his father would have sent him to a boardingschool but his mamma and aunt would not hear of his lying out of the house so that there was a clergyman engaged as his tutor in the family  as it was but just turned of twelve and the whole house was in commotion to prepare a formal entertainment i foresaw it would be late before we dined and proposed a walk to mr baynard that we might converse together freely in the course of this perambulation when i expressed some surprize that he had returned so soon from italy he gave me to understand that his going abroad had not at all answered the purpose for which he left england that although the expence of living was not so great in italy as at home respect being had to the same rank of life in both countries it had been found necessary for him to lift himself above his usual stile that he might be on some footing with the counts marquises and cavaliers with whom he kept companyhe was obliged to hire a great number of servants to take off a great variety of rich cloaths and to keep a sumptuous table for the fashionable scorocconi of the country who without a consideration of this kind would not have payed any attention to an untitled foreigner let his family or fortune be ever so respectablebesides mrs baynard was continually surrounded by a train of expensive loungers under the denominations of languagemasters musicians painters and ciceroni and had actually fallen into the disease of buying pictures and antiques upon her own judgment which was far from being infallibleat length she met with an affront which gave her disgust to italy and drove her back to england with some precipitation by means of frequenting the dutchess of bedfords conversazione while her grace was at rome mrs baynard became acquainted with all the fashionable people of that city and was admitted to their assemblies without scruplethus favoured she conceived too great an idea of her own importance and when the dutchess left rome resolved to have a conversazione that should leave the romans no room to regret her graces departure she provided hands for a musical entertainment and sent biglietti of invitation to every person of distinction but not one roman of the female sex appeared at her assemblyshe was that night seized with a violent fit and kept her bed three days at the expiration of which she declared that the air of italy would be the ruin of her constitution in order to prevent this catastrophe she was speedily removed to geneva from whence they returned to england by the way of lyons and paris by the time they arrived at calais she had purchased such a quantity of silks stuffs and laces that it was necessary to hire a vessel to smuggle them over and this vessel was taken by a customhouse cutter so that they lost the whole cargo which had cost them above eight hundred pounds  it now appears that her travels had produced no effect upon her but that of making her more expensive and fantastic than ever she affected to lead the fashion not only in point of female dress but in every article of taste and connoisseurship she made a drawing of the new facade to the house in the country she pulled up the trees and pulled down the walls of the garden so as to let in the easterly wind which mr baynards ancestors had been at great pains to exclude to shew her taste in laying out ground she seized into her own hand a farm of two hundred acres about a mile from the house which she parcelled out into walks and shrubberies having a great bason in the middle into which she poured a whole stream that turned two mills and afforded the best trout in the country the bottom of the bason however was so ill secured that it would not hold the water which strained through the earth and made a bog of the whole plantation in a word the ground which formerly payed him one hundred and fifty pounds a year now cost him two hundred pounds a year to keep it in tolerable order over and above the first expence of trees shrubs flowers turf and gravel there was not an inch of garden ground left about the house nor a tree that produced fruit of any kind nor did he raise a truss of hay or a bushel of oats for his horses nor had he a single cow to afford milk for his tea far less did he ever dream of feeding his own mutton pigs and poultry every article of housekeeping even the most inconsiderable was brought from the next market town at the distance of five miles and thither they sent a courier every morning to fetch hot rolls for breakfast in short baynard fairly owned that he spent double his income and that in a few years he should be obliged to sell his estate for the payment of his creditors he said that his wife had such delicate nerves and such imbecility of spirit that she could neither bear remonstrance be it ever so gentle nor practise any scheme of retrenchment even if she perceived the necessity of such a measure he had therefore ceased struggling against the stream and endeavoured to reconcile himself to ruin by reflecting that his child at least would inherit his mothers fortune which was secured to him by the contract of marriage  the detail which he gave me of his affairs filled me at once with grief and indignation i inveighed bitterly against the indiscretion of his wife and reproached him with his unmanly acquiescence under the absurd tyranny which she exerted i exhorted him to recollect his resolution and make one effectual effort to disengage himself from a thraldom equally shameful and pernicious i offered him all the assistance in my power i undertook to regulate his affairs and even to bring about a reformation in his family if he would only authorise me to execute the plan i should form for his advantage i was so affected by the subject that i could not help mingling tears with my remonstrances and baynard was so penetrated with these marks of my affection that he lost all power of utterance he pressed me to his breast with great emotion and wept in silence at length he exclaimed friendship is undoubtedly the most precious balm of life your words dear bramble have in a great measure recalled me from an abyss of despondence in which i have been long overwhelmed i will upon honour make you acquainted with a distinct state of my affairs and as far as i am able to go will follow the course you prescribe but there are certain lengths which my naturethe truth is there are tender connexions of which a batchelor has no ideashall i own my weakness i cannot bear the thoughts of making that woman uneasyand yet cried i she has seen you unhappy for a series of yearsunhappy from her misconduct without ever shewing the least inclination to alleviate your distressnevertheless said he i am persuaded she loves me with the most warm affection but these are incongruities in the composition of the human mind which i hold to be inexplicable  i was shocked at his infatuation and changed the subject after we had agreed to maintain a close correspondence for the future he then gave me to understand that he had two neighbours who like himself were driven by their wives at full speed in the high road to bankruptcy and ruin all the three husbands were of dispositions very different from each other and according to this variation their consorts were admirably suited to the purpose of keeping them all three in subjection the views of the ladies were exactly the same they vied in grandeur that is in ostentation with the wife of sir charles chickwell who had four times their fortune and she again piqued herself upon making an equal figure with a neighbouring peeress whose revenue trebled her own here then was the fable of the frog and the ox realized in four different instances within the same county one large fortune and three moderate estates in a fair way of being burst by the inflation of female vanity and in three of these instances three different forms of female tyranny were exercised mr baynard was subjugated by practising upon the tenderness of his nature mr milksan being of a timorous disposition truckled to the insolence of a termagant mr sowerby who was of a temper neither to be moved by fits nor driven by menaces had the fortune to be fitted with a helpmate who assailed him with the weapons of irony and satire sometimes sneering in the way of compliment sometimes throwing out sarcastic comparisons implying reproaches upon his want of taste spirit and generosity by which means she stimulated his passions from one act of extravagance to another just as the circumstances of her vanity required  all these three ladies have at this time the same number of horses carriages and servants in and out of livery the same variety of dress the same quantity of plate and china the like ornaments in furniture and in their entertainments they endeavour to exceed one another in the variety delicacy and expence of their dishes i believe it will be found upon enquiry that nineteen out of twenty who are ruined by extravagance fall a sacrifice to the ridiculous pride and vanity of silly women whose parts are held in contempt by the very men whom they pillage and enslave thank heaven dick that among all the follies and weaknesses of human nature i have not yet fallen into that of matrimony  after baynard and i had discussed all these matters at leisure we returned towards the house and met jery with our two women who had come forth to take the air as the lady of the mansion had not yet made her appearance in short mrs baynard did not produce herself till about a quarter of an hour before dinner was upon the table then her husband brought her into the parlour accompanied by her aunt and son and she received us with a coldness of reserve sufficient to freeze the very soul of hospitality though she knew i had been the intimate friend of her husband and had often seen me with him in london she shewed no marks of recognition or regard when i addressed myself to her in the most friendly terms of salutation she did not even express the common compliment of i am glad to see you or i hope you have enjoyed your health since we had the pleasure of seeing you or some such words of course nor did she once open her mouth in the way of welcome to my sister and my niece but sat in silence like a statue with an aspect of insensibility her aunt the model upon which she had been formed was indeed the very essence of insipid formality but the boy was very pert and impudent and prated without ceasing  at dinner the lady maintained the same ungracious indifference never speaking but in whispers to her aunt and as to the repast it was made up of a parcel of kickshaws contrived by a french cook without one substantial article adapted to the satisfaction of an english appetite the pottage was little better than bread soaked in dishwashings lukewarm the ragouts looked as if they had been once eaten and half digested the fricassees were involved in a nasty yellow poultice and the rotis were scorched and stinking for the honour of the fumet the desert consisted of faded fruit and iced froth a good emblem of our landladys character the tablebeer was sour the water foul and the wine vapid but there was a parade of plate and china and a powdered lacquey stood behind every chair except those of the master and mistress of the house who were served by two valets dressed like gentlemen we dined in a large old gothic parlour which was formerly the hall it was now paved with marble and notwithstanding the fire which had been kindled about an hour struck me with such a chill sensation that when i entered it the teeth chattered in my jawsin short every thing was cold comfortless and disgusting except the looks of my friend baynard which declared the warmth of his affection and humanity  after dinner we withdrew into another apartment where the boy began to be impertinently troublesome to my niece liddy he wanted a playfellow forsooth and would have romped with her had she encouraged his advanceshe was even so impudent as to snatch a kiss at which she changed countenance and seemed uneasy and though his father checked him for the rudeness of his behaviour he became so outrageous as to thrust his hand in her bosom an insult to which she did not tamely submit though one of the mildest creatures upon earth her eyes sparkling with resentment she started up and lent him such a box in the ear as sent him staggering to the other side of the room  miss melford cried his father you have treated him with the utmost proprietyi am only sorry that the impertinence of any child of mine should have occasioned this exertion of your spirit which i cannot but applaud and admire his wife was so far from assenting to the candour of his apology that she rose from the table and taking her son by the hand come child said she your father cannot abide you so saying she retired with this hopeful youth and was followed by her gouvernante but neither the one nor the other deigned to take the least notice of the company  baynard was exceedingly disconcerted but i perceived his uneasiness was tinctured with resentment and derived a good omen from this discovery i ordered the horses to be put to the carriage and though he made some efforts to detain us all night i insisted upon leaving the house immediately but before i went away i took an opportunity of speaking to him again in private i said every thing i could recollect to animate his endeavours in shaking off those shameful trammels i made no scruple to declare that his wife was unworthy of that tender complaisance which he had shewn for her foibles that she was dead to all the genuine sentiments of conjugal affection insensible of her own honour and interest and seemingly destitute of common sense and reflection i conjured him to remember what he owed to his fathers house to his own reputation and to his family including even this unreasonable woman herself who was driving on blindly to her own destruction i advised him to form a plan for retrenching superfluous expence and try to convince the aunt of the necessity for such a reformation that she might gradually prepare her niece for its execution and i exhorted him to turn that disagreeable piece of formality out of the house if he should find her averse to his proposal  here he interrupted me with a sigh observing that such a step would undoubtedly be fatal to mrs baynardi shall lose all patience cried i to hear you talk so weaklymrs baynards fits will never hurt her constitution i believe in my conscience they are all affected i am sure she has no feeling for your distresses and when you are ruined she will appear to have no feeling for her own finally i took his word and honour that he would make an effort such as i had advised that he would form a plan of oeconomy and if he found it impracticable without my assistance he would come to bath in the winter where i promised to give him the meeting and contribute all in my power to the retrieval of his affairswith this mutual engagement we parted and i shall think myself supremely happy if by my means a worthy man whom i love and esteem can be saved from misery disgrace and despair  i have only one friend more to visit in this part of the country but he is of a complexion very different from that of baynard you have heard me mention sir thomas bullford whom i knew in italy he is now become a country gentleman but being disabled by the gout from enjoying any amusement abroad he entertains himself within doors by keeping open house for all corners and playing upon the oddities and humours of his company but he himself is generally the greatest original at his table he is very goodhumoured talks much and laughs without ceasing i am told that all the use he makes of his understanding at present is to excite mirth by exhibiting his guests in ludicrous attitudes i know not how far we may furnish him with entertainment of this kind but i am resolved to beat up his quarters partly with a view to laugh with the knight himself and partly to pay my respects to his lady a goodnatured sensible woman with whom he lives upon very easy terms although she has not had the good fortune to bring him an heir to his estate  and now dear dick i must tell you for your comfort that you are the only man upon earth to whom i would presume to send such a longwinded epistle which i could not find in my heart to curtail because the subject interested the warmest passions of my heart neither will i make any other apology to a correspondent who has been so long accustomed to the impertinence of  matt bramble sept  0     to sir watkin phillips bart at oxon  dear knight  i believe there is something mischievous in my disposition for nothing diverts me so much as to see certain characters tormented with false terrorswe last night lodged at the house of sir thomas bullford an old friend of my uncle a jolly fellow of moderate intellects who in spite of the gout which hath lamed him is resolved to be merry to the last and mirth he has a particular knack in extracting from his guests let their humour be ever so caustic or refractorybesides our company there was in the house a fatheaded justice of the peace called frogmore and a country practitioner in surgery who seemed to be our landlords chief companion and confidantwe found the knight sitting on a couch with his crutches by his side and his feet supported on cushions but he received us with a hearty welcome and seemed greatly rejoiced at our arrivalafter tea we were entertained with a sonata on the harpsichord by lady bullford who sung and played to admiration but sir thomas seemed to be a little asinine in the article of ears though he affected to be in raptures and begged his wife to favour us with an arietta of her own composingthis arietta however she no sooner began to perform than he and the justice fell asleep but the moment she ceased playing the knight waked snorting and exclaimed o cara what dye think gentlemen will you talk any more of your pargolesi and your corelliat the same time he thrust his tongue in one cheek and leered with one eye at the doctor and me who sat on his left hand he concluded the pantomime with a loud laugh which he could command at all times extemporenotwithstanding his disorder he did not do penance at supper nor did he ever refuse his glass when the toast went round but rather encouraged a quick circulation both by precept and example  i soon perceived the doctor had made himself very necessary to the baronethe was the whetstone of his wit the butt of his satire and his operator in certain experiments of humour which were occasionally tried upon strangersjustice frogmore was an excellent subject for this species of philosophy sleek and corpulent solemn and shallow he had studied burn with uncommon application but he studied nothing so much as the art of living that is eating wellthis fat buck had often afforded good sport to our landlord and he was frequently started with tolerable success in the course of this evening but the baronets appetite for ridicule seemed to be chiefly excited by the appearance address and conversation of lismahago whom he attempted in all different modes of exposition but he put me in mind of a contest that i once saw betwixt a young hound and an old hedgehogthe dog turned him over and over and bounced and barked and mumbled but as often as he attempted to bite he felt a prickle in his jaws and recoiled in manifest confusionthe captain when left to himself will not fail to turn his ludicrous side to the company but if any man attempts to force him into that attitude he becomes stubborn as a mule and unmanageable as an elephant unbroke  divers tolerable jokes were cracked upon the justice who eat a most unconscionable supper and among other things a large plate of broiled mushrooms which he had no sooner swallowed than the doctor observed with great gravity that they were of the kind called champignons which in some constitutions has a poisonous effectmr frogmore startled at this remark asked in some confusion why he had not been so kind as to give him that notice soonerhe answered that he took it for granted by his eating them so heartily that he was used to the dish but as he seemed to be under some apprehension he prescribed a bumper of plague water which the justice drank off immediately and retired to rest not without marks of terror and disquiet  at midnight we were shewn to our different chambers and in half an hour i was fast asleep in bed but about three oclock in the morning i was waked with a dismal cry of fire and starting up ran to the window in my shirtthe night was dark and stormy and a number of people halfdressed ran backwards and forwards thro the courtyard with links and lanthorns seemingly in the utmost hurry and trepidationslipping on my cloaths in a twinkling i ran down stairs and upon enquiry found the fire was confined to a backstair which led to a detached apartment where lismahago layby this time the lieutenant was alarmed by bawling at his window which was in the second story but he could not find his cloaths in the dark and his roomdoor was locked on the outsidethe servants called to him that the house had been robbed that without all doubt the villains had taken away his cloaths fastened the door and set the house on fire for the staircase was in flamesin this dilemma the poor lieutenant ran about the room naked like a squirrel in a cage popping out his bead at the window between whiles and imploring assistanceat length the knight in person was brought out in his chair attended by my uncle and all the family including our aunt tabitha who screamed and cried and tore her hair as if she had been distractedsir thomas had already ordered his people to bring a long ladder which was applied to the captains window and now he exhorted him earnestly to descendthere was no need of much rhetoric to persuade lismahago who forthwith made his exit by the window roaring all the time to the people below to hold fast the ladder  notwithstanding the gravity of the occasion it was impossible to behold this scene without being seized with an inclination to laugh the rueful aspect of the lieutenant in his shirt with a quilted nightcap fastened under his chin and his long lank limbs and posteriors exposed to the wind made a very picturesque appearance when illumined by the links and torches which the servants held up to light him in his descentall the company stood round the ladder except the knight who sat in his chair exclaiming from time to time lord have mercy upon ussave the gentlemans lifemind your footing dear captain softlystand fastclasp the ladder with both handstherewell done my dear boyo bravoan old soldier for everbring a blanket bring a warm blanket to comfort his poor carcasewarm the bed in the green roomgive me your hand dear captainim rejoiced to see thee safe and sound with all my heart lismahago was received at the foot of the ladder by his inamorata who snatching a blanket from one of the maids wrapped it about his body two menservants took him under the arms and a female conducted him to the green room still accompanied by mrs tabitha who saw him fairly put to bedduring this whole transaction he spoke not a syllable but looked exceeding grim sometimes at one sometimes at another of the spectators who now adjourned in a body to the parlour where we had supped every one surveying another with marks of astonishment and curiosity  the knight being seated in an easy chair seized my uncle by the hand and bursting into a long and loud laugh matt cried he crown me with oak or ivy or laurel or parsely or what you will and acknowledge this to be a coup de maitre in the way of waggeryha ha hasuch a camisciata scagliata beffata o che roba o what a subjecto

barrabasha ha ha after all then cried mr bramble very gravely this was no more than a false alarmwe have been frightened out of our beds and almost out of our senses for the jokes sake ay and such a joke cried our landlord such a farce such a denouement such a catastrophe  have a little patience replied our squire we are not yet come to the catastrophe and pray god it may not turn out a tragedy instead of a farcethe captain is one of those saturnine subjects who have no idea of humourhe never laughs in his own person nor can he bear that other people should laugh at his expence besides if the subject had been properly chosen the joke was too severe in all conscience sdeath cried the knight i could not have bated him an ace had he been my own father and as for the subject such another does not present itself once in half a century here mrs tabitha interposing and bridling up declared she did not see that mr lismahago was a fitter subject for ridicule than the knight himself and that she was very much afraid he would very soon find he had mistaken his manthe baronet was a good deal disconcerted by his intimation saying that he must be a goth and a barbarian if he did not enter into the spirit of such a happy and humourous contrivancehe begged however that mr bramble and his sister would bring him to reason and this request was reinforced by lady bullford who did not fail to read the baronet a lecture upon his indiscretion which lecture he received with submission on one side of his face and a leer upon the other  we now went to bed for the second time and before i got up my uncle had visited lismahago in the green room and used such arguments with him that when we met in the parlour he seemed to be quite appeased he received the knights apology with good grace and even professed himself pleased at finding he had contributed to the diversion of the companysir thomas shook him by the hand laughing heartily and then desired a pinch of snuff in token of perfect reconciliationthe lieutenant putting his hand in his waistcoat pocket pulled out instead of his own scotch mull a very fine gold snuffbox which he no sooner perceived than he said here is a small mistake no mistake at all cried the baronet a fair exchange is no robberyoblige me so far captain as to let me keep your mull as a memorial sir said the lieutenant the mull is much at your service but this machine i can by no means retainit looks like compounding a sort of felony in the code of honour besides i dont know but there may be another joke in this conveyance and i dont find myself disposed to be brought upon the stage againi wont presume to make free with your pockets but i beg you will put it up again with your own hand so saying with a certain austerity of aspect he presented the snuffbox to the knight who received it in some confusion and restored the mull which he would by no means keep except on the terms of exchange  this transaction was like to give a grave cast to the conversation when my uncle took notice that mr justice frogmore had not made his appearance either at the nightalarm or now at the general rendezvous the baronet hearing frogmore mentioned odso cried he i had forgot the justiceprythee doctor go and bring him out of his kennel then laughing till his sides were well shaken he said he would shew the captain that he was not the only person of the drama exhibited for the entertainment of the company as to the nightscene it could not affect the justice who had been purposely lodged in the farther end of the house remote from the noise and lulled with a dose of opium into the bargain in a few minutes mr justice was led into the parlour in his nightcap and loose morninggown rolling his head from side to side and groaning piteously all the wayjesu neighbour frogmore exclaimed the baronet what is the matteryou look as if you was not a man for this worldset him down softly on the couchpoor gentlemenlord have mercy upon uswhat makes him so pale and yellow and bloated oh sir thomas cried the justice i doubt tis all over with me those mushrooms i eat at your table have done my businessah oh hey now the lord forbid said the otherwhat man have a good hearthow does thy stomach feelhall  to this interrogation he made no reply but throwing aside his nightgown discovered that his waistcoat would not meet upon his belly by five good inches at least heaven protect us all cried sir thomas what a melancholy spectaclenever did i see a man so suddenly swelled but when he was either just dead or just dyingdoctor canst thou do nothing for this poor object i dont think the case is quite desperate said the surgeon but i would advise mr frogmore to settle his affairs with all expedition the parson may come and pray by him while i prepare a glyster and an emetic draught the justice rolling his languid eyes ejaculated with great fervency lord have mercy upon us christ have mercy upon usthen he begged the surgeon in the name of god to dispatchas for my worldly affairs said he they are all settled but one mortgage which must be left to my heirsbut my poor soul my poor soul what will become of my poor soul miserable sinner that i am nay prythee my dear boy compose thyself resumed the knight consider the mercy of heaven is infinite thou canst not have any sins of a very deep dye on thy conscience or the devils int name not the devil exclaimed the terrified frogmore i have more sins to answer for than the world dreams ofah friend i have been slysly damnd slysend for the parson without loss of time and put me to bed for i am posting to eternityhe was accordingly raised from the couch and supported by two servants who led him back to his room but before he quitted the parlour he intreated the good company to assist him with their prayershe added take warning by me who am suddenly cut off in my prime like a flower of the field and god forgive you sir thomas for suffering such poisonous trash to be eaten at your table  he was no sooner removed out of hearing than the baronet abandoned himself to a violent fit of laughing in which he was joined by the greatest part of the company but we could hardly prevent the good lady from going to undeceive the patient by discovering that while he slept his waistcoat had been straitened by the contrivance of the surgeon and that the disorder in his stomach and bowels was occasioned by some antimonial wine which he had taken over night under the denomination of plaguewater she seemed to think that his apprehension might put an end to his life the knight swore he was no such chicken but a tough old rogue that would live long enough to plague all his neighboursupon enquiry we found his character did not intitle him to much compassion or respect and therefore we let our landlords humour take its coursea glyster was actually administered by an old woman of the family who had been sir thomass nurse and the patient took a draught made with oxymel of squills to forward the operation of the antimonial wine which had been retarded by the opiate of the preceding night he was visited by the vicar who read prayers and began to take an account of the state of his soul when those medicines produced their effect so that the parson was obliged to hold his nose while he poured forth spiritual consolation from his mouth the same expedient was used by the knight and me who with the doctor entered the chamber at this juncture and found frogmore enthroned on an easingchair under the pressure of a double evacuation the short intervals betwixt every heave he employed in crying for mercy confessing his sins or asking the vicars opinion of his case and the vicar answered in a solemn snuffling tone that heightened the ridicule of the scene the emetic having done its office the doctor interfered and ordered the patient to be put in bed again when he examined the egesta and felt his pulse he declared that much of the virus was discharged and giving him a composing draught assured him he had good hopes of his recoverythis welcome hint he received with the tears of joy in his eyes protesting that if he should recover he would always think himself indebted for his life to the great skill and tenderness of his doctor whose hand he squeezed with great fervour and thus he was left to his repose  we were pressed to stay dinner that we might be witnesses of his resuscitation but my uncle insisted upon our departing before noon that we might reach this town before it should be darkin the meantime lady bullford conducted us into the garden to see a fishpond just finished which mr bramble censured as being too near the parlour where the knight now sat by himself dozing in an elbowchair after the fatigues of his morning atchievementin this situation he reclined with his feet wrapped in flannel and supported in a line with his body when the door flying open with a violent shock lieutenant lismahago rushed into the room with horror in his looks exclaiming a mad dog a mad dog and throwing up the window sash leaped into the gardensir thomas waked by this tremendous exclamation started up and forgetting his gout followed the lieutenants example by a kind of instinctive impulse he not only bolted thro the window like an arrow from a bow but ran up to his middle in the pond before he gave the least sign of recollection then the captain began to bawl lord have mercy upon uspray take care of the gentlemanfor gods sake mind your footing my dear boyget warm blanketscomfort his poor carcasewarm the bed in the green room  lady bullford was thunderstruck at this phaenomenon and the rest of the company gazed in silent astonishment while the servants hastened to assist their master who suffered himself to be carried back into the parlour without speaking a wordbeing instantly accommodated with dry clothes and flannels comforted with a cordial and replaced in statu quo one of the maids was ordered to chafe his lower extremities an operation in consequence of which his senses seemed to return and his good humour to reviveas we had followed him into the room he looked at every individual in his turn with a certain ludicrous expression in his countenance but fixed his eyes in particular upon lismahago who presented him with a pinch of snuff and when he took it in silence sir thomas bullford said he i am much obliged to you for all your favours and some of them i have endeavoured to repay in your own coin give me thy hand cried the baronet thou hast indeed payed me scot and lot and even left a balance in my hands for which in presence of this company i promise to be accountableso saying he laughed very heartily and even seemed to enjoy the retaliation which had been exacted at his own expence but lady bullford looked very grave and in all probability thought the lieutenant had carried his resentment too far considering that her husband was valetudinarybut according to the proverb he that will play at bowls must expect to meet with rubbers i have seen a tame bear very diverting when properly managed become a very dangerous wild beast when teized for the entertainment of the spectatorsas for lismahago he seemed to think the fright and the cold bath would have a good effect upon his patients constitution but the doctor hinted some apprehension that the gouty matter might by such a sudden shock be repelled from the extremities and thrown upon some of the more vital parts of the machinei should be very sorry to see this prognostic verified upon our facetious landlord who told mrs tabitha at parting that he hoped she would remember him in the distribution of the brides favours as he had taken so much pains to put the captains parts and mettle to the proofafter all i am afraid our squire will appear to be the greatest sufferer by the baronets wit for his constitution is by no means calculated for nightalarms he has yawned and shivered all day and gone to bed without supper so that as we have got into good quarters i imagine we shall make a halt tomorrow in which case you will have at least one days respite from the persecution of  j melford oct       to mrs mary jones

dear mary jones always yours win jenkins oct       to miss laetitia willis at gloucester  my dear letty  this method of writing to you from time to time without any hopes of an answer affords me i own some ease and satisfaction in the midst of my disquiet as it in some degree lightens the burthen of affliction but it is at best a very imperfect enjoyment of friendship because it admits of no return of confidence and good counseli would give the whole world to have your company for a single dayi am heartily tired of this itinerant way of life i am quite dizzy with a perpetual succession of objectsbesides it is impossible to travel such a length of way without being exposed to inconveniencies dangers and disagreeable accidents which prove very grievous to a poor creature of weak nerves like me and make me pay very dear for the gratification of my curiosity  nature never intended me for the busy worldi long for repose and solitude where i can enjoy that disinterested friendship which is not to be found among crouds and indulge those pleasing reveries that shun the hurry and tumult of fashionable societyunexperienced as i am in the commerce of life i have seen enough to give me a disgust to the generality of those who carry it onthere is such malice treachery and dissimulation even among professed friends and intimate companions as cannot fail to strike a virtuous mind with horror and when vice quits the stage for a moment her place is immediately occupied by folly which is often too serious to excite any thing but compassion perhaps i ought to be silent on the foibles of my poor aunt but with you my dear willis i have no secrets and truly her weaknesses are such as cannot be concealed since the first moment we arrived at bath she has been employed constantly in spreading nets for the other sex and at length she has caught a superannuated lieutenant who is in a fair way to make her change her namemy uncle and my brother seem to have no objection to this extraordinary match which i make no doubt will afford abundance of matter for conversation and mirth for my part i am too sensible of my own weaknesses to be diverted with those of other peopleat present i have something at heart that employs my whole attention and keeps my mind in the utmost terror and suspence  yesterday in the forenoon as i stood with my brother at the parlour window of an inn where we had lodged a person passed a horseback whom gracious heaven i instantly discovered to be wilson he wore a white ridingcoat with the cape buttoned up to his chin looking remarkably pale and passed at a round trot without seeming to observe usindeed he could not see us for there was a blind that concealed us from the view you may guess how i was affected at this apparition the light forsook my eyes and i was seized with such a palpitation and trembling that i could not stand i sat down upon a couch and strove to compose myself that my brother might not perceive my agitation but it was impossible to escape his prying eyeshe had observed the object that alarmed me and doubtless knew him at the first glancehe now looked at me with a stern countenance then he ran out into the street to see what road the unfortunate horseman had takenhe afterwards dispatched his man for further intelligence and seemed to meditate some violent design my uncle being out of order we remained another night at the inn and all day long jery acted the part of an indefatigable spy upon my conducthe watched my very looks with such eagerness of attention as if he would have penetrated into the utmost recesses of my heartthis may be owing to his regard for my honour if it is not the effect of his own pride but he is so hot and violent and unrelenting that the sight of him alone throws me into a flutter and really it will not be in my power to afford him any share of my affection if he persists in persecuting me at this rate i am afraid he has formed some scheme of vengeance which will make me completely wretched i am afraid he suspects some collusion from this appearance of wilsongood god did he really appear or was it only a phantom a pale spectre to apprise me of his death  o letty what shall i dowhere shall i turn for advice and consolation shall i implore the protection of my uncle who has been always kind and compassionatethis must be my last resourcei dread the thoughts of making him uneasy and would rather suffer a thousand deaths than live the cause of dissension in the familyi cannot conceive the meaning of wilsons coming hitherperhaps it was in quest of us in order to disclose his real name and situationbut wherefore pass without staying to make the least enquirymy dear willis i am lost in conjecture i have not closed an eye since i saw himall night long have i been tossed about from one imagination to another the reflection finds no resting placei have prayed and sighed and wept plentifullyif this terrible suspence continues much longer i shall have another fit of illness and then the whole family will be in confusionif it was consistent with the wise purposes of providence would i were in my gravebut it is my duty to be resignedmy dearest letty excuse my weaknessexcuse these blotsmy tears fall so fast that i cannot keep the paper dryyet i ought to consider that i have as yet no cause to despair but i am such a fainthearted timorous creature  thank god my uncle is much better than he was yesterday he is resolved to pursue our journey strait to walesi hope we shall take gloucester in our waythat hope chears my poor heart i shall once more embrace my best beloved willis and pour all my griefs into her friendly bosom0 heaven is it possible that such happiness is reserved for  the dejected and forlorn lydia melford oct       to sir watkin phillips bart of jesus college oxon  dear watkin  i yesterday met with an incident which i believe you will own to be very surprisingas i stood with liddy at the window of the inn where we had lodged who should pass by but wilson ahorse backi could not be mistaken in the person for i had a full view of him as he advanced i plainly perceived by my sisters confusion that she recognized him at the same time i was equally astonished and incensed at his appearance which i could not but interpret into an insult or something worse i ran out at the gate and seeing him turn the corner of the street i dispatched my servant to observe his motions but the fellow was too late to bring me that satisfaction he told me however that there was an inn called the red lion at that end of the town where he supposed the horseman had alighted but that he would not enquire without further orders i sent him back immediately to know what strangers were in the house and he returned with a report that there was one mr wilson lately arrived in consequence of this information i charged him with a note directed to that gentleman desiring him to meet me in half an hour in a certain field at the towns end with a case of pistols in order to decide the difference which could not be determined at our last rencounter but i did not think proper to subscribe the billet my man assured me he had delivered it into his own hand and that having read it he declared he would wait upon the gentleman at the place and time appointed  malpine being an old soldier and luckily sober at the time i entrusted him with my secret i ordered him to be within call and having given him a letter to be delivered to my uncle in case of accident i repaired to the rendezvous which was an inclosed field at a little distance from the highway i found my antagonist had already taken his ground wrapped in a dark horsemans coat with a laced hat flapped over his eyes but what was my astonishment when throwing off this wrapper he appeared to be a person whom i had never seen before he had one pistol stuck in a leather belt and another in his hand ready for action and advancing a few steps called to know if i was readyi answered no and desired a parley upon which he turned the muzzle of his piece towards the earth then replaced it in his belt and met me half waywhen i assured him he was not the man i expected to meet he said it might be so that he had received a slip of paper directed to mr wilson requesting him to come hither and that as there was no other in the place of that name he naturally concluded the note was intended for him and him onlyi then gave him to understand that i had been injured by a person who assumed that name which person i had actually seen within the hour passing through the street on horseback that hearing there was a mr wilson at the red lion i took it for granted he was the man and in that belief had writ the billet and i expressed my surprize that he who was a stranger to me and my concerns should give me such a rendezvous without taking the trouble to demand a previous explanation he replied that there was no other of his name in the whole country that no such horseman had alighted at the red lion since nine oclock when he arrivedthat having had the honour to serve his majesty he thought he could not decently decline any invitation of this kind from what quarter soever it might come and that if any explanation was necessary it did not belong to him to demand it but to the gentleman who summoned him into the field vexed as i was at this adventure i could not help admiring the coolness of this officer whose open countenance prepossessed me in his favour he seemed to be turned of forty wore his own short black hair which curled naturally about his ears and was very plain in his apparelwhen i begged pardon for the trouble i had given him he received my apology with great good humourhe told me that he lived about ten miles off at a small farmhouse which would afford me tolerable lodging if i would come and take diversion of hunting with him for a few weeks in which case we might perhaps find out the man who had given me offencei thanked him very sincerely for his courteous offer which i told him i was not at liberty to accept at present on account of my being engaged in a family party and so we parted with mutual professions of good will and esteem  now tell me dear knight what am i to make of this singular adventure am i to suppose that the horseman i saw was really a thing of flesh and blood or a bubble that vanished into airor must i imagine liddy knows more of the matter than she chuses to discloseif i thought her capable of carrying on any clandestine correspondence with such a fellow i should at once discard all tenderness and forget that she was connected with me by the ties of bloodbut how is it possible that a girl of her simplicity and inexperience should maintain such an intercourse surrounded as she is with so many eyes destitute of all opportunity and shifting quarters every day of her lifebesides she has solemnly promised noi cant think the girl so baseso insensible to the honour of her familywhat disturbs me chiefly is the impression which these occurrences seem to make upon her spiritsthese are the symptoms from which i conclude that the rascal has still a hold on her affection surely i have a right to call him a rascal and to conclude that his designs are infamous but it shall be my fault if he does not one day repent his presumptioni confess i cannot think much less write on this subject with any degree of temper or patience i shall therefore conclude with telling you that we hope to be in wales by the latter end of the month but before that period you will probably hear again from  your affectionate j melford oct       to sir watkin phillips bart of jesus college oxon  dear phillips  when i wrote you by last post i did not imagine i should be tempted to trouble you again so soon but i now sit down with a heart so full that it cannot contain itself though i am under such agitation of spirits that you are to expect neither method nor connexion in this addresswe have been this day within a hairs breadth of losing honest matthew bramble in consequence of a cursed accident which i will endeavour to explainin crossing the country to get into the post road it was necessary to ford a river and we that were ahorseback passed without any danger or difficulty but a great quantity of rain having fallen last night and this morning there was such an accumulation of water that a millhead gave way just as the coach was passing under it and the flood rushed down with such impetuosity as first floated and then fairly overturned the carriage in the middle of the streamlismahago and i and the two servants alighting instantaneously ran into the river to give all the assistance in our powerour aunt mrs tabitha who had the good fortune to be uppermost was already half way out of the coach window when her lover approaching disengaged her entirely but whether his foot slipt or the burthen was too great they fell over head and ears in each others arms he endeavoured more than once to get up and even to disentangle himself from her embrace but she hung about his neck like a millstone no bad emblem of matrimony and if my man had not proved a stanch auxiliary those two lovers would in all probability have gone hand in hand to the shades belowfor my part i was too much engaged to take any cognizance of their distressi snatched out my sister by the hair of the head and dragging her to the bank recollected that my uncle had not yet appearedrushing again into the stream i met clinker hauling ashore mrs jenkins who looked like a mermaid with her hair dishevelled about her ears but when i asked if his master was safe he forthwith shook her from him and she must have gone to pot if a miller had not seasonably come to her reliefas for humphry he flew like lightning to the coach that was by this time filled with water and diving into it brought up the poor squire to all appearance deprived of lifeit is not in my power to describe what i felt at this melancholy spectacleit was such an agony as baffles all description the faithful clinker taking him up in his arms as if he had been an infant of six months carried him ashore howling most piteously all the way and i followed him in a transport of grief and consternationwhen he was laid upon the grass and turned from side to side a great quantity of water ran out at his mouth then he opened his eyes and fetched a deep sigh clinker perceiving these signs of life immediately tied up his arm with a garter and pulling out a horsefleam let him blood in the farrier stileat first a few drops only issued from the orifice but the limb being chafed in a little time the blood began to flow in a continued stream and he uttered some incoherent words which were the most welcome sounds that ever saluted my ear there was a country inn hard by the landlord of which had by this time come with his people to give their assistancethither my uncle being carried was undressed and put to bed wrapped in warm blankets but having been moved too soon he fainted away and once more lay without sense or motion notwithstanding all the efforts of clinker and the landlord who bathed his temples with hungary water and held a smellingbottle to his nose as i had heard of the efficacy of salt in such cases i ordered all that was in the house to be laid under his head and body and whether this application had the desired effect or nature of herself prevailed he in less than a quarter of an hour began to breathe regularly and soon retrieved his recollection to the unspeakable joy of all the bystanders as for clinker his brain seemed to be affectedhe laughed and wept and danced about in such a distracted manner that the landlord very judiciously conveyed him out of the room my uncle seeing me dropping wet comprehended the whole of what had happened and asked if all the company was safebeing answered in the affirmative he insisted upon my putting on dry clothes and having swallowed a little warm wine desired he might be left to his repose before i went to shift myself i inquired about the rest of the familyi found mrs tabitha still delirious from her fright discharging very copiously the water she had swallowed she was supported by the captain distilling drops from his uncurled periwig so lank and so dank that he looked like father thames without his sedges embracing isis while she cascaded in his urn mrs jenkins was present also in a loose bed gown without either cap or handkerchief but she seemed to be as little compos mentis as her mistress and acted so many cross purposes in the course of her attendance that between the two lismahago had occasion for all his philosophy as for liddy i thought the poor girl would have actually lost her senses the good woman of the house had shifted her linen and put her into bed but she was seized with the idea that her uncle had perished and in this persuasion made a dismal outcry nor did she pay the least regard to what i said when i solemnly assured her he was safe mr bramble hearing the noise and being informed of her apprehension desired she might be brought into his chamber and she no sooner received this intimation than she ran thither half naked with the wildest expression of eagerness in her countenanceseeing the squire sitting up in the bed she sprung forwards and throwing her arms about his neck exclaimed in a most pathetic tone are youare you indeed my unclemy dear unclemy best friend my fatherare you really living or is it an illusion of my poor brain honest matthew was so much affected that he could not help shedding tears while he kissed her forehead saying my dear liddy i hope i shall live long enough to shew how sensible i am of your affectionbut your spirits are fluttered childyou want restgo to bed and compose yourselfwell i will she replied but still methinks this cannot be realthe coach was full of watermy uncle was under us allgracious godyou was under waterhow did you get outtell me that or i shall think this is all a deceptionin what manner i was brought out i know as little as you do my dear said the squire and truly that is a circumstance of which i want to be informed i would have given him a detail of the whole adventure but he would not hear me until i should change my clothes so that i had only time to tell him that he owed his life to the courage and fidelity of clinker and having given him this hint i conducted my sister to her own chamber  this accident happened about three oclock in the afternoon and in little more than an hour the hurricane was all over but as the carriage was found to be so much damaged that it could not proceed without considerable repairs a blacksmith and wheelwright were immediately sent for to the next markettown and we congratulated ourselves upon being housed at an inn which though remote from the postroad afforded exceeding good lodging the women being pretty well composed and the men all afoot my uncle sent for his servant and in the presence of lismahago and me accosted him in these wordsso clinker i find you are resolved i shant die by wateras you have fished me up from the bottom at your own risque you are at least entitled to all the money that was in my pocket and there it isso saying he presented him with a purse containing thirty guineas and a ring nearly of the same valuegod forbid cried clinker your honour shall excuse mei am a poor fellow but i have a heart o if your honour did but know how i rejoice to seeblessed be his holy name that made me the humble instrumentbut as for the lucre of gain i renounce iti have done no more than my dutyno more than i would have done for the most worthless of my fellowcreaturesno more than i would have done for captain lismahago or archy macalpine or any sinner upon earthbut for your worship i would go through fire as well as wateri do believe it humphry said the squire but as you think it was your duty to save my life at the hazard of your own i think it is mine to express the sense i have of your extraordinary fidelity and attachmenti insist upon your receiving this small token of my gratitude but dont imagine that i look upon this as an adequate recompence for the service you have done mei have determined to settle thirty pounds ayear upon you for life and i desire these gentlemen will bear witness to this my intention of which i have a memorandum in my pocketbook lord make me thankful for all these mercies cried clinker sobbing i have been a poor bankrupt from the beginningyour honours goodness found me when i wasnaked when i wassick and forlorni understand your honours looksi would not give offencebut my heart is very fulland if your worship wont give me leave to speaki must vent it in prayers to heaven for my benefactor when he quitted the room lismahago said he should have a much better opinion of his honesty if he did not whine and cant so abominably but that he had always observed those weeping and praying fellows were hypocrites at bottom mr bramble made no reply to this sarcastic remark proceeding from the lieutenants resentment of clinker having in pure simplicity of heart ranked him with malpine and the sinners of the earththe landlord being called to receive some orders about the beds told the squire that his house was very much at his service but he was sure he should not have the honour to lodge him and his company he gave us to understand that his master who lived hard by would not suffer us to be at a public house when there was accommodation for us at his own and that if he had not dined abroad in the neighbourhood he would have undoubtedly come to offer his services at our first arrival he then launched out in praise of that gentleman whom he had served as butler representing him as a perfect miracle of goodness and generosity he said he was a person of great learning and allowed to be the best farmer in the countrythat he had a lady who was as much beloved as himself and an only son a very hopeful young gentleman just recovered from a dangerous fever which had like to have proved fatal to the whole family for if the son had died he was sure the parents would not have survived their losshe had not yet finished the encomium of mr dennison when this gentleman arrived in a postchaise and his appearance seemed to justify all that had been said in his favour he is pretty well advanced in years but hale robust and florid with an ingenuous countenance expressive of good sense and humanity having condoled with us on the accident which had happened he said he was come to conduct us to his habitation where we should be less incommoded than at such a paultry inn and expressed his hope that the ladies would not be the worse for going thither in his carriage as the distance was not above a quarter of a mile my uncle having made a proper return to this courteous exhibition eyed him attentively and then asked if he had not been at oxford a commoner of queens college when mr dennison answered yes with some marks of surpriselook at me then said our squire and let us see if you can recollect the features of an old friend whom you have not seen these forty yearsthe gentleman taking him by the hand and gazing at him earnestlyi protest cried he i do think i recall the idea of matthew loyd of glamorganshire who was student of jesus well remembered my dear friend charles dennison exclaimed my uncle pressing him to his breast i am that very identical matthew loyd of glamorgan clinker who had just entered the room with some coals for the fire no sooner heard these words than throwing down the scuttle on the toes of lismahago he began to caper as if he was mad cryingmatthew loyd of glamorgano providencematthew loyd of glamorganthen clasping my uncles knees he went on in this manneryour worship must forgive mematthew loyd of glamorgano lord sir i cant contain myselfi shall lose my sensesnay thou hast lost them already i believe said the squire peevishly prithee clinker be quietwhat is the matterhumphry fumbling in his bosom pulled out an old wooden snuffbox which he presented in great trepidation to his master who opening it immediately perceived a small cornelian seal and two scraps of paperat sight of these articles he started and changed colour and casting his eye upon the inscriptionshahowwhat where cried he is the person here named clinker knocking his own breast could hardly pronounce these wordshereherehere is matthew loyd as the certificate shewethhumphry clinker was the name of the farrier that took me prenticeand who gave you these tokens said my uncle hastilymy poor mother on her deathbedreplied the otherand who was your mother dorothy twyford an please your honour heretofore barkeeper at the angel at chippenhamand why were not these tokens produced before my mother told me she had wrote to glamorganshire at the time of my birth but had no answer and that afterwards when she made enquiry there was no such person in that county and so in consequence of my changing my name and going abroad at that very time thy poor mother and thou have been left to want and miseryi am really shocked at the consequence of my own follythen laying his hand on clinkers head he added stand forth matthew loydyou see gentlemen how the sins of my youth rise up in judgment against mehere is my direction written with my own hand and a seal which i left at the womans request and this is a certificate of the childs baptism signed by the curate of the parish the company were not a little surprised at this discovery upon which mr dennison facetiously congratulated both the father and the son for my part i shook my newfound cousin heartily by the hand and lismahago complimented him with the tears in his eyes for he had been hopping about the room swearing in broad scotch and bellowing with the pain occasioned by the fall of the coalscuttle upon his foot he had even vowed to drive the saul out of the body of that mad rascal but perceiving the unexpected turn which things had taken he wished him joy of his good fortune observing that it went very near his heart as he was like to be a great toe out of pocket by the discoverymr dennison now desired to know for what reason my uncle had changed the name by which he knew him at oxford and our squire satisfied him by answering to this effecti took my mothers name which was loyd as heir to her lands in glamorganshire but when i came of age i sold that property in order to clear my paternal estate and resumed my real name so that i am now matthew bramble of brambletonhall in monmouthshire at your service and this is my nephew jeremy melford of belfield in the county of glamorgan at that instant the ladies entering the room he presented mrs tabitha as his sister and liddy as his niece the old gentleman saluted them very cordially and seemed struck with the appearance of my sister whom he could not help surveying with a mixture of complacency and surprizesister said my uncle there is a poor relation that recommends himself to your good gracesthe quondam humphry clinker is metamorphosed into matthew loyd and claims the honour of being your carnal kinsmanin short the rogue proves to be a crab of my own planting in the days of hot blood and unrestrained libertinism clinker had by this time dropt upon one knee by the side of mrs tabitha who eyeing him askance and flirting her fan with marks of agitation thought proper after some conflict to hold out her hand for him to kiss saying with a demure aspect brother you have been very wicked but i hope youll live to see the folly of your waysi am very sorry to say the young man whom you have this day acknowledged has more grace and religion by the gift of god than you with all your profane learning and repeated opportunityi do think he has got the trick of the eye and the tip of the nose of my uncle loyd of flluydwellyn and as for the long chin it is the very moral of the governorsbrother as you have changed his name pray change his dress also that livery doth not become any person that hath got our blood in his veinsliddy seemed much pleased with this acquisition to the familyshe took him by the hand declaring she should always be proud to own her connexion with a virtuous young man who had given so many proofs of his gratitude and affection to her unclemrs winifred jenkins extremely fluttered between her surprize at this discovery and the apprehension of losing her sweetheart exclaimed in a giggling tonei wish you joy mr clinkerfloydi would sayhi hi hiyoull be so proud you wont look at your poor fellow servants oh oh oh honest clinker owned he was overjoyed at his good fortune which was greater than he deservedbut wherefore should i be proud said he a poor object conceived in sin and brought forth in iniquity nursed in a parish workhouse and bred in a smithy whenever i seem proud mrs jenkins i beg of you to put me in mind of the condition i was in when i first saw you between chippenham and marlborough  when this momentous affair was discussed to the satisfaction of all parties concerned the weather being dry the ladies declined the carriage so that we walked all together to mr dennisons house where we found the tea ready prepared by his lady an amiable matron who received us with all the benevolence of hospitality the house is old fashioned and irregular but lodgeable and commodious to the south it has the river in front at the distance of a hundred paces and on the north there is a rising ground covered with an agreeable plantation the greens and walks are kept in the nicest order and all is rural and romantic i have not yet seen the young gentleman who is on a visit to a friend in the neighbourhood from whose house he is not expected till tomorrow  in the mean time as there is a man going to the next market town with letters for the post i take this opportunity to send you the history of this day which has been remarkably full of adventures and you will own i give you them like a beefsteak at dollys hot and hot without ceremony and parade just as they come from the recollection of  yours j melford     to dr lewis  dear dick  since the last trouble i gave you i have met with a variety of incidents some of them of a singular nature which i reserve as a fund for conversation but there are others so interesting that they will not keep in petto till meeting  know then it was a thousand pounds to a sixpence that you should now be executing my will instead of perusing my letter two days ago our coach was overturned in the midst of a rapid river where my life was saved with the utmost difficulty by the courage activity and presence of mind of my servant humphry clinkerbut this is not the most surprising circumstance of the adventurethe said humphry clinker proves to be matthew loyd natural son of one matthew loyd of glamorgan if you know any such personyou see doctor that notwithstanding all your philosophy it is not without some reason that the welchmen ascribe such energy to the force of bloodbut we shall discuss this point on some future occasion  this is not the only discovery which i made in consequence of our disasterwe happened to be wrecked upon a friendly shorethe lord of the manor is no other than charles dennison our fellowrake at oxfordwe are now happily housed with that gentleman who has really attained to that pitch of rural felicity at which i have been aspiring these twenty years in vain he is blessed with a consort whose disposition is suited to his own in all respects tender generous and benevolentshe moreover possesses an uncommon share of understanding fortitude and discretion and is admirably qualified to be his companion confidant counsellor and coadjutrix these excellent persons have an only son about nineteen years of age just such a youth as they could have wished that heaven would bestow to fill up the measure of their enjoymentin a word they know no other allay to their happiness but their apprehension and anxiety about the life and concerns of this beloved object  our old friend who had the misfortune to be a second brother was bred to the law and even called to the bar but he did not find himself qualified to shine in that province and had very little inclination for his professionhe disobliged his father by marrying for love without any consideration of fortune so that he had little or nothing to depend upon for some years but his practice which afforded him a bare subsistence and the prospect of an increasing family began to give him disturbance and disquiet in the mean time his father dying was succeeded by his elder brother a foxhunter and a sot who neglected his affairs insulted and oppressed his servants and in a few years had well nigh ruined the estate when he was happily carried off by a fever the immediate consequence of a debauch charles with the approbation of his wife immediately determined to quit business and retire into the country although this resolution was strenuously and zealously opposed by every individual whom he consulted on the subject those who had tried the experiment assured him that he could not pretend to breathe in the country for less than the double of what his estate produced that in order to be upon the footing of a gentleman he would be obliged to keep horses hounds carriages with a suitable number of servants and maintain an elegant table for the entertainment of his neighbours that farming was a mystery known only to those who had been bred up to it from the cradle the success of it depending not only upon skill and industry but also upon such attention and oeconomy as no gentleman could be supposed to give or practise accordingly every attempt made by gentlemen miscarried and not a few had been ruined by their prosecution of agriculturenay they affirmed that he would find it cheaper to buy hay and oats for his cattle and to go to market for poultry eggs kitchen herbs and roots and every the most inconsiderable article of housekeeping than to have those articles produced on his own ground  these objections did not deter mr dennison because they were chiefly founded on the supposition that he would be obliged to lead a life of extravagance and dissipation which he and his consort equally detested despised and determined to avoidthe objects he had in view were health of body peace of mind and the private satisfaction of domestic quiet unallayed by actual want and uninterrupted by the fears of indigencehe was very moderate in his estimate of the necessaries and even of the comforts of lifehe required nothing but wholesome air pure water agreeable exercise plain diet convenient lodging and decent apparel he reflected that if a peasant without education or any great share of natural sagacity could maintain a large family and even become opulent upon a farm for which he payed an annual rent of two or three hundred pounds to the landlord surely he himself might hope for some success from his industry having no rent to pay but on the contrary three or four hundred pounds a year to receive he considered that the earth was an indulgent mother that yielded her fruits to all her children without distinction he had studied the theory of agriculture with a degree of eagerness and delight and he could not conceive there was any mystery in the practice but what he should be able to disclose by dint of care and application with respect to houshold expence he entered into a minute detail and investigation by which he perceived the assertions of his friends were altogether erroneoushe found he should save sixty pounds a year in the single article of houserent and as much more in pocketmoney and contingencies that even butchersmeat was twenty per cent cheaper in the country than in london but that poultry and almost every other circumstance of housekeeping might be had for less than onehalf of what they cost in town besides a considerable saving on the side of dress in being delivered from the oppressive imposition of ridiculous modes invented by ignorance and adopted by folly  as to the danger of vying with the rich in pomp and equipage it never gave him the least disturbance he was now turned of forty and having lived half that time in the busy scenes of life was well skilled in the science of mankind there cannot be in nature a more contemptible figure than that of a man who with five hundred a year presumes to rival in expence a neighbour who possesses five times that incomehis ostentation far from concealing serves only to discover his indigence and render his vanity the more shocking for it attracts the eyes of censure and excites the spirit of inquiry there is not a family in the county nor a servant in his own house nor a farmer in the parish but what knows the utmost farthing that his lands produce and all these behold him with scorn or compassion i am surprised that these reflections do not occur to persons in this unhappy dilemma and produce a salutary effect but the truth is of all the passions incident to human nature vanity is that which most effectually perverts the faculties of the understanding nay it sometimes becomes so incredibly depraved as to aspire at infamy and find pleasure in bearing the stigmas of reproach  i have now given you a sketch of the character and situation of mr dennison when he came down to take possession of this estate but as the messenger who carries the letters to the next town is just setting off i shall reserve what further i have to say on this subject till the next post when you shall certainly hear from   yours always matt bramble oct       to dr lewis  once more dear doctor i resume the pen for your amusement it was on the morning after our arrival that walking out with my friend mr dennison i could not help breaking forth into the warmest expressions of applause at the beauty of the scene which is really inchanting and i signified in particular how much i was pleased with the disposition of some detached groves that afforded at once shelter and ornament to his habitation  when i took possession of these lands about two and twenty years ago said he there was not a tree standing within a mile of the house except those of an old neglected orchard which produced nothing but leaves and mossit was in the gloomy month of november when i arrived and found the house in such a condition that it might have been justly stiled the tower of desolationthe courtyard was covered with nettles and docks and the garden exhibited such a rank plantation of weeds as i had never seen beforethe windowshutters were falling in piecesthe sashes brokenand owls and jackdaws had taken possession of the chimniesthe prospect within was still more drearyall was dark and damp and dirty beyond descriptionthe rain penetrated in several parts of the roofin some apartments the very floors had given waythe hangings were parted from the walls and shaking in mouldy remnants the glasses were dropping out of their framesthe familypictures were covered with dust and all the chairs and tables wormeaten and crazythere was not a bed in the house that could be used except one oldfashioned machine with a high gilt tester and fringed curtains of yellow mohair which had been for aught i know two centuries in the familyin short there was no furniture but the utensils of the kitchen and the cellar afforded nothing but a few empty butts and barrels that stunk so abominably that i would not suffer any body to enter it until i had flashed a considerable quantity of gunpowder to qualify the foul air within  an old cottager and his wife who were hired to lie in the house had left it with precipitation alledging among other causes of retreat that they could not sleep for frightful noises and that my poor brother certainly walked after his deathin a word the house appeared uninhabitable the barn stable and outhouses were in ruins all the fences broken down and the fields lying waste  the farmer who kept the key never dreamed i had any intention to live upon the spothe rented a farm of sixty pounds and his lease was just expiringhe had formed a scheme of being appointed bailiff to the estate and of converting the house and the adjacent grounds to his own usea hint of his intention i received from the curate at my first arrival i therefore did not pay much regard to what he said by way of discouraging me from coming to settle in the country but i was a little startled when he gave me warning that he should quit the farm at the expiration of his lease unless i could abate considerably in the rent  at this period i accidentally became acquainted with a person whose friendship laid the foundation of all my prosperity in the next markettown i chanced to dine at an inn with a mr wilson who was lately come to settle in the neighbourhoodhe had been lieutenant of a man of war but quitted the sea in some disgust and married the only daughter of farmer bland who lives in this parish and has acquired a good fortune in the way of husbandrywilson is one of the best natured men i ever knew brave frank obliging and ingenuoushe liked my conversation i was charmed with his liberal manner and acquaintance immediately commenced and this was soon improved into a friendship without reservethere are characters which like similar particles of matter strongly attract each otherhe forthwith introduced me to his fatherinlaw farmer bland who was well acquainted with every acre of my estate of consequence well qualified to advise me on this occasionfinding i was inclined to embrace a country life and even to amuse myself with the occupation of farming he approved of my designhe gave me to understand that all my farms were underlett that the estate was capable of great improvement that there was plenty of chalk in the neighbourhood and that my own ground produced excellent marle for manurewith respect to the farm which was like to fall into my hands he said he would willingly take it at the present rent but at the same time owned that if i would expend two hundred pounds in enclosure it would be worth more than double the sum  thus encouraged i began the execution of my scheme without further delay and plunged into a sea of expence though i had no fund in reserve and the whole produce of the estate did not exceed three hundred pounds a yearin one week my house was made weathertight and thoroughly cleansed from top to bottom then it was well ventilated by throwing all the doors and windows open and making blazing fires of wood in every chimney from the kitchen to the garrets the floors were repaired the sashes new glazed and out of the old furniture of the whole house i made shift to fit up a parlour and three chambers in a plain yet decent mannerthe courtyard was cleared of weeds and rubbish and my friend wilson charged himself with the dressing of the garden bricklayers were set at work upon the barn and stable and labourers engaged to restore the fences and begin the work of hedging and ditching under the direction of farmer bland at whose recommendation i hired a careful hind to lie in the house and keep constant fires in the apartments  having taken these measures i returned to london where i forthwith sold off my householdfurniture and in three weeks from my first visit brought my wife hither to keep her christmasconsidering the gloomy season of the year the dreariness of the place and the decayed aspect of our habitation i was afraid that her resolution would sink under the sudden transition from a town life to such a melancholy state of rustication but i was agreeably disappointedshe found the reality less uncomfortable than the picture i had drawnby this time indeed things were mended in appearancethe outhouses had risen out of their ruins the pigeonhouse was rebuilt and replenished by wilson who also put my garden in decent order and provided a good stock of poultry which made an agreeable figure in my yard and the house on the whole looked like the habitation of human creaturesfarmer bland spared me a milch cow for my family and an ordinary saddlehorse for my servant to go to market at the next towni hired a country lad for a footman the hinds daughter was my housemaid and my wife had brought a cookmaid from london  such was my family when i began housekeeping in this place with three hundred pounds in my pocket raised from the sale of my superfluous furniturei knew we should find occupation enough through the day to employ our time but i dreaded the long winter evenings yet for those too we found a remedy the curate who was a single man soon became so naturalized to the family that he generally lay in the house and his company was equally agreeable and useful he was a modest man a good scholar and perfectly well qualified to instruct me in such country matters as i wanted to knowmr wilson brought his wife to see us and she became so fond of mrs dennison that she said she was never so happy as when she enjoyed the benefit of her conversationshe was then a fine buxom country lass exceedingly docile and as goodnatured as her husband jack wilson so that a friendship ensued among the women which hath continued to this day  as for jack he hath been my constant companion counsellor and commissaryi would not for a hundred pounds you should leave my house without seeing himjack is an universal geniushis talents are really astonishinghe is an excellent carpenter joiner and turner and a cunning artist in iron and brasshe not only superintended my oeconomy but also presided over my pastimeshe taught me to brew beer to make cyder perry mead usquebaugh and plaguewater to cook several outlandish delicacies such as ollas pepperpots pillaws corys chabobs and stufatashe understands all manner of games from chess down to chuckfarthing sings a good song plays upon the violin and dances a hornpipe with surprising agilityhe and i walked and rode and hunted and fished together without minding the vicissitudes of the weather and i am persuaded that in a raw moist climate like this of england continual exercise is as necessary as food to the preservation of the individualin the course of two and twenty years there has not been one hours interruption or abatement in the friendship subsisting between wilsons family and mine and what is a rare instance of good fortune that friendship is continued to our childrenhis son and mine are nearly of the same age and the same disposition they have been bred up together at the same school and college and love each other with the warmest affection  by wilsons means i likewise formed an acquaintance with a sensible physician who lives in the next markettown and his sister an agreeable old maiden passed the christmas holidays at our house mean while i began my farming with great eagerness and that very winter planted these groves that please you so muchas for the neighbouring gentry i had no trouble from that quarter during my first campaign they were all gone to town before i settled in the country and by the summer i had taken measures to defend myself from their attackswhen a gay equipage came to my gates i was never at home those who visited me in a modest way i received and according to the remarks i made on their characters and conversation either rejected their advances or returned their civilityi was in general despised among the fashionable company as a low fellow both in breeding and circumstances nevertheless i found a few individuals of moderate fortune who gladly adopted my stile of living and many others would have acceded to our society had they not been prevented by the pride envy and ambition of their wives and daughtersthose in times of luxury and dissipation are the rocks upon which all the small estates in the country are wrecked  i reserved in my own hands some acres of ground adjacent to the house for making experiments in agriculture according to the directions of lyle tull hart duhamel and others who have written on this subject and qualified their theory with the practical observations of farmer bland who was my great master in the art of husbandryin short i became enamoured of a country life and my success greatly exceeded my expectationi drained bogs burned heath grubbed up furze and fern i planted copse and willows where nothing else would grow i gradually inclosed all my farms and made such improvements that my estate now yields me clear twelve hundred pounds a yearall this time my wife and i have enjoyed uninterrupted health and a regular flow of spirits except on a very few occasions when our cheerfulness was invaded by such accidents as are inseparable from the condition of life i lost two children in their infancy by the smallpox so that i have one son only in whom all our hopes are centeredhe went yesterday to visit a friend with whom he has stayed all night but he will be here to dinneri shall this day have the pleasure of presenting him to you and your family and i flatter myself you will find him not altogether unworthy of our affection  the truth is either i am blinded by the partiality of a parent or he is a boy of very amiable character and yet his conduct has given us unspeakable disquietyou must know we had projected a match between him and a gentlemans daughter in the next county who will in all probability be heiress of a considerable fortune but it seems he had a personal disgust to the alliance he was then at cambridge and tried to gain time on various pretences but being pressed in letters by his mother and me to give a definitive answer he fairly gave his tutor the slip and disappeared about eight months agobefore he took this rash step he wrote me a letter explaining his objections to the match and declaring that he would keep himself concealed until he should understand that his parents would dispense with his contracting an engagement that must make him miserable for life and he prescribed the form of advertising in a certain newspaper by which he might be apprized of our sentiments on this subject  you may easily conceive how much we were alarmed and afflicted by this elopement which he had made without dropping the least hint to his companion charles wilson who belonged to the same collegewe resolved to punish him with the appearance of neglect in hopes that he would return of his own accord but he maintained his purpose till the young lady chose a partner for herself then he produced himself and made his peace by the mediation of wilsonsuppose we should unite our families by joining him with your niece who is one of the most lovely creatures i ever beheldmy wife is already as fond of her as if she were her own child and i have a presentiment that my son will be captivated by her at first sight nothing could be more agreeable to all our family said i than such an alliance but my dear friend candour obliges me to tell you that i am afraid liddys heart is not wholly disengagedthere is a cursed obstacleyou mean the young stroller at gloucester said heyou are surprised that i should know this circumstance but you will be more surprised when i tell you that stroller is no other than my son george dennisonthat was the character he assumed in his eclipse i am indeed astonished and overjoyed cried i and shall be happy beyond expression to see your proposal take effect  he then gave me to understand that the young gentleman at his emerging from concealment had disclosed his passion for miss melford the niece of mr bramble of monmouthshire though mr dennison little dreamed that this was his old friend matthew loyd he nevertheless furnished his son with proper credentials and he had been at bath london and many other places in quest of us to make himself and his pretensions known  the bad success of his enquiry had such an effect upon his spirits that immediately at his return he was seized with a dangerous fever which overwhelmed his parents with terror and affliction but he was now happily recovered though still weak and disconsolate my nephew joining us in our walk i informed him of these circumstances with which he was wonderfully pleased he declared he would promote the match to the utmost of his power and that he longed to embrace young mr dennison as his friend and brothermean while the father went to desire his wife to communicate this discovery gradually to liddy that her delicate nerves might not suffer too sudden a shock and i imparted the particulars to my sister tabby who expressed some surprize not altogether unmixed i believe with an emotion of envy for though she could have no objection to an alliance at once so honourable and advantageous she hesitated in giving her consent on pretence of the youth and inexperience of the parties at length however she acquiesced in consequence of having consulted with captain lismahago  mr dennison took care to be in the way when his son arrived at the gate and without giving him time or opportunity to make any enquiry about the strangers brought him up stairs to be presented to mr loyd and his familythe first person he saw when he entered the room was liddy who notwithstanding all her preparation stood trembling in the utmost confusionat sight of this object he was fixed motionless to the floor and gazing at her with the utmost eagerness of astonishment exclaimed sacred heaven what is thisha wherefore here his speech failing he stood straining his eyes in the most emphatic silence george said his father this is my friend mr loyd roused at this intimation he turned and received my salute when i said young gentleman if you had trusted me with your secret at our last meeting we should have parted upon better terms before he could make any answer jery came round and stood before him with open armsat first he started and changed colour but after a short pause he rushed into his embrace and they hugged one another as if they had been intimate friends from their infancy then he payed his respects to mrs tabitha and advancing to liddy is it possible cried he that my senses do not play me false that i see miss melford under my fathers roofthat i am permitted to speak to her without giving offenceand that her relations have honoured me with their countenance and protection liddy blushed and trembled and falteredto be sure sir said she it is a very surprising circumstancea greata providentiali really know not what i saybut i beg you will think i have said whats agreeable  mrs dennison interposing said compose yourselves my dear childrenyour mutual happiness shall be our peculiar care the son going up to his mother kissed one hand my niece bathed the other with her tears and the good old lady pressed them both in their turns to her breastthe lovers were too much affected to get rid of their embarrassment for one day but the scene was much enlivened by the arrival of jack wilson who brought as usual some game of his own killinghis honest countenance was a good letter of recommendation i received him like a dear friend after a long separation and i could not help wondering to see him shake jery by the hand as an old acquaintancethey had indeed been acquainted some days in consequence of a diverting incident which i shall explain at meeting that same night a consultation was held upon the concerns of the lovers when the match was formally agreed to and all the marriage articles were settled without the least disputemy nephew and i promised to make liddys fortune five thousand pounds mr dennison declared he would make over one half of his estate immediately to his son and that his daughterinlaw should be secured in a jointure of four hundredtabby proposed that considering their youth they should undergo one year at least of probation before the indissoluble knot should be tied but the young gentleman being very impatient and importunate and the scheme implying that the young couple should live in the house under the wings of his parents we resolved to make them happy without further delay  as the law requires that the parties should be some weeks resident in the parish we shall stay here till the ceremony is performedmr lismahago requests that he may take the benefit of the same occasion so that next sunday the banns will be published for all four togetheri doubt i shall not be able to pass my christmas with you at brambletonhallindeed i am so agreeably situated in this place that i have no desire to shift my quarters and i foresee that when the day of separation comes there will be abundance of sorrow on all sidesin the mean time we must make the most of those blessings which heaven bestowsconsidering how you are tethered by your profession i cannot hope to see you so far from home yet the distance does not exceed a summerdays journey and charles dennison who desires to be remembered to you would be rejoiced to see his old compotator but as i am now stationary i expect regular answers to the epistles of  yours invariably matt bramble oct        to sir watkin phillips bart at oxon  dear wat  every day is now big with incident and discoveryyoung mr dennison proves to be no other than that identical person whom i have execrated so long under the name of wilsonhe had eloped from college at cambridge to avoid a match that he detested and acted in different parts of the country as a stroller until the lady in question made choice of a husband for herself then he returned to his father and disclosed his passion for liddy which met with the approbation of his parents though the father little imagined that mr bramble was his old companion matthew loyd the young gentleman being impowered to make honourable proposals to my uncle and me had been in search of us all over england without effect and he it was whom i had seen pass on horseback by the window of the inn where i stood with my sister but he little dreamed that we were in the houseas for the real mr wilson whom i called forth to combat by mistake he is the neighbour and intimate friend of old mr dennison and this connexion had suggested to the son the idea of taking that name while he remained in obscurity  you may easily conceive what pleasure i must have felt on discovering that the honour of our family was in no danger from the conduct of a sister whom i love with uncommon affection that instead of debasing her sentiments and views to a wretched stroller she had really captivated the heart of a gentleman her equal in rank and superior in fortune and that as his parents approved of his attachment i was on the eve of acquiring a brotherinlaw so worthy of my friendship and esteem george dennison is without all question one of the most accomplished young fellows in england his person is at once elegant and manly and his understanding highly cultivated tho his spirit is lofty his heart is kind and his manner so engaging as to command veneration and love even from malice and indifference when i weigh my own character with his i am ashamed to find myself so light in the balance but the comparison excites no envyi propose him as a model for imitationi have endeavoured to recommend myself to his friendship and hope i have already found a place in his affection i am however mortified to reflect what flagrant injustice we every day commit and what absurd judgment we form in viewing objects through the falsifying mediums of prejudice and passion had you asked me a few days ago the picture of wilson the player i should have drawn a portrait very unlike the real person and character of george dennison without all doubt the greatest advantage acquired in travelling and perusing mankind in the original is that of dispelling those shameful clouds that darken the faculties of the mind preventing it from judging with candour and precision  the real wilson is a great original and the best tempered companionable man i ever knewi question if ever he was angry or lowspirited in his life he makes no pretensions to letters but he is an adept in every thing else that can be either useful or entertaining among other qualifications he is a complete sportsman and counted the best shot in the county he and dennison and lismahago and i attended by clinker went ashooting yesterday and made a great havock among the partridgestomorrow we shall take the field against the woodcocks and snipes in the evening we dance and sing or play at commerce loo and quadrille  mr dennison is an elegant poet and has written some detached pieces on the subject of his passion for liddy which must be very flattering to the vanity of a young womanperhaps he is one of the greatest theatrical geniuses that ever appeared he sometimes entertains us with reciting favourite speeches from our best plays we are resolved to convert the great hall into a theatre and get up the beaux stratagem without delayi think i shall make no contemptible figure in the character of scrub and lismahago will be very great in captain gibbet wilson undertakes to entertain the country people with harlequin skeleton for which he has got a jacket ready painted with his own hand  our society is really enchanting even the severity of lismahago relaxes and the vinegar of mrs tabby is remarkably dulcified ever since it was agreed that she should take precedency of her niece in being first noosed for you must know the day is fixed for liddys marriage and the banns for both couples have been already once published in the parish church the captain earnestly begged that one trouble might serve for all and tabitha assented with a vile affectation of reluctance her inamorato who came hither very slenderly equipt has sent for his baggage to london which in all probability will not arrive in time for the wedding but it is of no great consequence as every thing is to be transacted with the utmost privacymeanwhile directions are given for making out the contracts of marriage which are very favourable for both females liddy will be secured in a good jointure and her aunt will remain mistress of her own fortune except one half of the interest which her husband shall have a right to enjoy for his natural life i think this is as little in conscience as can be done for a man who yokes with such a partner for life  these expectants seem to be so happy that if mr dennison had an agreeable daughter i believe i should be for making the third couple in this country dance the humour seems to be infectious for clinker alias loyd has a months mind to play the fool in the same fashion with mrs winifred jenkins he has even sounded me on the subject but i have given him no encouragement to prosecute this schemei told him i thought he might do better as there was no engagement nor promise subsisting that i did not know what designs my uncle might have formed for his advantage but i was of opinion that he should not at present run the risque of disobliging him by any premature application of this naturehonest humphry protested he would suffer death sooner than do or say any thing that should give offence to the squire but he owned he had a kindness for the young woman and had reason to think she looked upon him with a favourable eye that he considered this mutual manifestation of good will as an engagement understood which ought to be binding to the conscience of an honest man and he hoped the squire and i would be of the same opinion when we should be at leisure to bestow any thought about the matteri believe he is in the right and we shall find time to take his case into considerationyou see we are fixed for some weeks at least and as you have had a long respite i hope you will begin immediately to discharge the arrears due to  your affectionate j melford oct        to miss laetitia willis at gloucester  my dear dear letty  never did i sit down to write in such agitation as i now feelin the course of a few days we have met with a number of incidents so wonderful

humphry clinker whom providence really seems to have placed near him for the necessity of this occasioni would not be thought superstitious but surely he acted from a stronger impulse than common fidelity was it not the voice of nature that loudly called upon him to save the life of his own father for 0 letty it was discovered that humphry clinker was my uncles natural son  almost at the same instant a gentleman who came to offer us his assistance and invite us to his house turned out to be a very old friend of mr bramblehis name is mr dennison one of the worthiest men living and his lady

melfordyou will easily conceive how embarrassing this situation must be to a young inexperienced creature like me of weak nerves and strong apprehensions and how much the presence of a friend and confidant would encourage and support me on this occasion you know that of all the young ladies miss willis was she that possessed the greatest share of my confidence and affection and therefore i

sarvice to saul  your ever loving and discounselled friend win jenkins oct        to dr lewis  dear dick  you cannot imagine what pleasure i have in seeing your handwriting after such a long cessation on your side of our correspondenceyet heaven knows i have often seen your handwriting with disgusti mean when it appeared in abbreviations of apothecarys latini like your hint of making interest for the reversion of the collectors place for mr lismahago who is much pleased with the scheme and presents you with his compliments and best thanks for thinking so kindly of his concernsthe man seems to mend upon further acquaintance that harsh reserve which formed a disagreeable husk about his character begins to peel off in the course of our communicationi have great hopes that he and tabby will be as happily paired as any two draught animals in the kingdom and i make no doubt but that he will prove a valuable acquisition to our little society in the article of conversation by the fireside in winter  your objection to my passing this season of the year at such a distance from home would have more weight if i did not find myself perfectly at my ease where i am and my health so much improved that i am disposed to bid defiance to gout and rheumatismi begin to think i have put myself on the superannuated list too soon and absurdly sought for health in the retreats of lazinessi am persuaded that all valetudinarians are too sedentary too regular and too cautiouswe should sometimes increase the motion of the machine to unclog the wheels of life and now and then take a plunge amidst the waves of excess in order to caseharden the constitution i have even found a change of company as necessary as a change of air to promote a vigorous circulation of the spirits which is the very essence and criterion of good health  since my last i have been performing the duties of friendship that required a great deal of exercise from which i hope to derive some benefitunderstanding by the greatest accident in the world that mr baynards wife was dangerously ill of a pleuritic fever i borrowed dennisons postchaise and went across the country to his habitation attended only by loyd quondam clinker on horsebackas the distance is not above thirty miles i arrived about four in the afternoon and meeting the physician at the door was informed that his patient had just expiredi was instantly seized with a violent emotion but it was not griefthe family being in confusion i ran up stairs into the chamber where indeed they were all assembledthe aunt stood wringing her hands in a kind of stupefaction of sorrow but my friend acted all the extravagancies of afflictionhe held the body in his arms and poured forth such a lamentation that one would have thought he had lost the most amiable consort and valuable companion upon earth  affection may certainly exist independent of esteem nay the same object may be lovely in one respect and detestable in anotherthe mind has a surprising faculty of accommodating and even attaching itself in such a manner by dint of use to things that are in their own nature disagreeable and even pernicious that it cannot bear to be delivered from them without reluctance and regret baynard was so absorbed in his delirium that he did not perceive me when i entered and desired one of the women to conduct the aunt into her own chamberat the same time i begged the tutor to withdraw the boy who stood gaping in a corner very little affected with the distress of the scenethese steps being taken i waited till the first violence of my friends transport was abated then disengaged him gently from the melancholy object and led him by the hand into another apartment though he struggled so hard that i was obliged to have recourse to the assistance of his valet de chambrein a few minutes however he recollected himself and folding me in his arms this cried he is a friendly office indeedi know not how you came hither but i think heaven sent you to prevent my going distractedo matthew i have lost my dear harrietmy poor gentle tender creature that loved me with such warmth and purity of affectionmy constant companion of twenty years shes goneshes gone for everheaven and earth where is shedeath shall not part us  so saying he started up and could hardly be withheld from returning to the scene we had quittedyou will perceive it would have been very absurd for me to argue with a man that talked so madlyon all such occasions the first torrent of passion must be allowed to subside graduallyi endeavoured to beguile his attention by starting little hints and insinuating other objects of discourse imperceptibly and being exceedingly pleased in my own mind at this event i exerted myself with such an extraordinary flow of spirits as was attended with successin a few hours he was calm enough to hear reason and even to own that heaven could not have interposed more effectually to rescue him from disgrace and ruinthat he might not however relapse into weaknesses for want of company i passed the night in his chamber in a little tent bed brought thither on purpose and well it was i took this precaution for he started up in bed several times and would have played the fool if i had not been present  next day he was in a condition to talk of business and vested me with full authority over his household which i began to exercise without loss of time tho not before he knew and approved of the scheme i had projected for his advantagehe would have quitted the house immediately but this retreat i opposedfar from encouraging a temporary disgust which might degenerate into an habitual aversion i resolved if possible to attach him more than ever to his houshold godsi gave directions for the funeral to be as private as was consistant with decency i wrote to london that an inventory and estimate might be made of the furniture and effects in his townhouse and gave notice to the landlord that mr baynard should quit the premises at ladyday i set a person at work to take account of every thing in the countryhouse including horses carriages and harness i settled the young gentleman at a boardingschool kept by a clergyman in the neighbourhood and thither he went without reluctance as soon as he knew that he was to be troubled no more with his tutor whom we dismissed the aunt continued very sullen and never appeared at table though mr baynard payed his respects to her every day in her own chamber there also she held conferences with the waitingwomen and other servants of the family but the moment her niece was interred she went away in a postchaise prepared for that purpose she did not leave the house however without giving mr baynard to understand that the wardrobe of her niece was the perquisite of her woman accordingly that worthless drab received all the clothes laces and linen of her deceased mistress to the value of five hundred pounds at a moderate computation  the next step i took was to disband that legion of supernumerary domestics who had preyed so long upon the vitals of my friend a parcel of idle drones so intolerably insolent that they even treated their own master with the most contemptuous neglect they had been generally hired by his wife according to the recommendation of her woman and these were the only patrons to whom they payed the least deference i had therefore uncommon satisfaction in clearing the house of these vermin the woman of the deceased and a chambermaid a valet de chambre a butler a french cook a master gardener two footmen and a coachman i payed off and turned out of the house immediately paying to each a months wages in lieu of warning those whom i retained consisted of the female cook who had been assistant to the frenchman a house maid an old lacquey a postilion and undergardener thus i removed at once a huge mountain of expence and care from the shoulders of my friend who could hardly believe the evidence of his own senses when he found himself so suddenly and so effectually relieved his heart however was still subject to vibrations of tenderness which returned at certain intervals extorting sighs and tears and exclamations of grief and impatience but these fits grew every day less violent and less frequent till at length his reason obtained a complete victory over the infirmities of his nature  upon an accurate enquiry into the state of his affairs i find his debts amount to twenty thousand pounds for eighteen thousand pounds of which sum his estate is mortgaged and as he pays five per cent interest and some of his farms are unoccupied he does not receive above two hundred pounds a year clear from his lands over and above the interest of his wifes fortune which produced eight hundred pounds annually for lightening this heavy burthen i devised the following expedient his wifes jewels together with his superfluous plate and furniture in both houses his horses and carriages which are already advertised to be sold by auction will according to the estimate produce two thousand five hundred pounds in ready money with which the debt will be immediately reduced to eighteen thousand poundsi have undertaken to find him ten thousand pounds at four per cent by which means he will save one hundred ayear in the article of interest and perhaps we shall be able to borrow the other eight thousand on the same terms according to his own scheme of a country life he says he can live comfortably for three hundred pounds ayear but as he has a son to educate we will allow him five hundred then there will be an accumulating fund of seven hundred ayear principal and interest to pay off the incumbrance and i think we may modestly add three hundred on the presumption of newleasing and improving the vacant farms so that in a couple of years i suppose there will be above a thousand ayear appropriated to liquidate a debt of sixteen thousand  we forthwith began to class and set apart the articles designed for sale under the direction of an upholder from london and that nobody in the house might be idle commenced our reformation without doors as well as within with baynards good leave i ordered the gardener to turn the rivulet into its old channel to refresh the fainting naiads who had so long languished among mouldring roots withered leaves and dry pebblesthe shrubbery is condemned to extirpation and the pleasure ground will be restored to its original use of cornfield and pastureorders are given for rebuilding the walls of the garden at the back of the house and for planting clumps of firs intermingled with beech and chestnut at the east end which is now quite exposed to the surly blasts that come from that quarter all these works being actually begun and the house and auction left to the care and management of a reputable attorney i brought baynard along with me in the chaise and made him acquainted with dennison whose goodness of heart would not fail to engage his esteem and affectionhe is indeed charmed with our society in general and declares that he never saw the theory of true pleasure reduced to practice before i really believe it would not be an easy task to find such a number of individuals assembled under one roof more happy than we are at present  i must tell you however in confidence i suspect tabby of tergiversationi have been so long accustomed to that original that i know all the caprices of her heart and can often perceive her designs while they are yet in embrioshe attached herself to lismahago for no other reason but that she despaired of making a more agreeable conquest at present if i am not much mistaken in my observation she would gladly convert the widowhood of baynard to her own advantagesince he arrived she has behaved very coldly to the captain and strove to fasten on the others heart with the hooks of overstrained civility these must be the instinctive efforts of her constitution rather than the effects of any deliberate design for matters are carried to such a length with the lieutenant that she could not retract with any regard to conscience or reputation besides she will meet with nothing but indifference or aversion on the side of baynard who has too much sense to think of such a partner at any time and too much delicacy to admit a thought of any such connexion at the present juncturemeanwhile i have prevailed upon her to let him have four thousand pounds at four per cent towards paying off his mortage young dennison has agreed that liddys fortune shall be appropriated to the same purpose on the same termshis father will sell out three thousand pounds stock for his accommodationfarmer bland has at the desire of wilson undertaken for two thousand and i must make an effort to advance what further will be required to take my friend out of the hands of the philistines he is so pleased with the improvements made on his estate which is all cultivated like a garden that he has entered himself as a pupil in farming to mr dennison and resolved to attach himself wholly to the practice of husbandry  every thing is now prepared for our double wedding the marriagearticles for both couples are drawn and executed and the ceremony only waits until the parties shall have been resident in the parish the term prescribed by law young dennison betrays some symptoms of impatience but lismahago bears this necessary delay with the temper of a philosopheryou must know the captain does not stand altogether on the foundation of personal merit besides his halfpay amounting to two and forty pounds a year this indefatigable oeconomist has amassed eight hundred pounds which he has secured in the funds this sum arises partly from his pays running up while he remained among the indians partly from what he received as a consideration for the difference between his full appointment and the halfpay to which he is now restricted and partly from the profits of a little traffick he drove in peltry during his sachemship among the miamis  liddys fears and perplexities have been much assuaged by the company of one miss willis who had been her intimate companion at the boardingschool her parents had been earnestly sollicited to allow her making this friendly visit on such an extraordinary occasion and two days ago she arrived with her mother who did not chuse that she should come without a proper gouvernante the young lady is very sprightly handsome and agreeable and the mother a mighty good sort of a woman so that their coming adds considerably to our enjoyment but we shall have a third couple yoked in the matrimonial chain mr clinker loyd has made humble remonstrance through the canal of my nephew setting forth the sincere love and affection mutually subsisting between him and mrs winifred jenkins and praying my consent to their coming together for life i would have wished that mr clinker had kept out of this scrape but as the nymphs happiness is at stake and she has already some fits in the way of despondence i in order to prevent any tragical catastrophe have given him leave to play the fool in imitation of his betters and i suppose we shall in time have a whole litter of his progeny at brambletonhall the fellow is stout and lusty very sober and conscientious and the wench seems to be as great an enthusiast in love as in religion  i wish you would think of employing him some other way that the parish may not be overstockedyou know he has been bred a farrier consequently belongs to the faculty and as he is very docile i make no doubt but with your good instruction he may be in a little time qualified to act as a welch apothecary tabby who never did a favour with a good grace has consented with great reluctance to this match perhaps it hurts her pride as she now considers clinker in the light of a relation but i believe her objections are of a more selfish nature she declares she cannot think of retaining the wife of matthew loyd in the character of a servant and she foresees that on such an occasion the woman will expect some gratification for her past services as for clinker exclusive of other considerations he is so trusty brave affectionate and alert and i owe him such personal obligations that he merits more than all the indulgence that can possibly be shewn him by  yours matt bramble oct        to sir watkin phillips bart at oxon  dear knight  the fatal knots are now tied the comedy is near a close and the curtain is ready to drop but the latter scenes of this act i shall recapitulate in orderabout a fortnight ago my uncle made an excursion across the country and brought hither a particular friend one mr baynard who has just lost his wife and was for some time disconsolate though by all accounts he had much more cause for joy than for sorrow at this eventhis countenance however clears up apace and he appears to be a person of rare accomplishmentsbut we have received another still more agreeable reinforcement to our company by the arrival of miss willis from gloucester she was liddys bosom friend at the boardingschool and being earnestly sollicited to assist at the nuptials her mother was so obliging as to grant my sisters request and even to come with her in person liddy accompanied by george dennison and me gave them the meeting halfway and next day conducted them hither in safety miss willis is a charming girl and in point of disposition an agreeable contrast to my sister who is rather too grave and sentimental for my turn of mind the other is gay frank a little giddy and always goodhumoured she has moreover a genteel fortune is well born and remarkably handsome ah phillips if these qualities were permanentif her humour would never change nor her beauties decay what efforts would i not makebut these are idle reflectionsmy destiny must one day be fulfilled  at present we pass the time as agreeably as we canwe have got up several farces which afforded unspeakable entertainment by the effects they produced among the country people who are admitted to all our exhibitionstwo nights ago jack wilson acquired great applause in harlequin skeleton and lismahago surprised us all in the character of pierothis long lank sides and strong marked features were all peculiarly adapted to his parthe appeared with a ludicrous stare from which he had discharged all meaning he adopted the impressions of fear and amazement so naturally that many of the audience were infected by his looks but when the skeleton held him in chace his horror became most divertingly picturesque and seemed to endow him with such praeternatural agility as confounded all the spectators it was a lively representation of death in pursuit of consumption and had such an effect upon the commonalty that some of them shrieked aloud and others ran out of the hall in the utmost consternation  this is not the only instance in which the lieutenant has lately excited our wonder his temper which had been soured and shrivelled by disappointment and chagrin is now swelled out and smoothed like a raisin in plumbporridge from being reserved and punctilious he is become easy and obliging he cracks jokes laughs and banters with the most facetious familiarity and in a word enters into all our schemes of merriment and pastimethe other day his baggage arrived in the waggon from london contained in two large trunks and a long deal box not unlike a coffin the trunks were filled with his wardrobe which he displayed for the entertainment of the company and he freely owned that it consisted chiefly of the opima spolia taken in battle what he selected for his wedding suit was a tarnished white cloth faced with blue velvet embroidered with silver but he valued himself most upon a tyeperiwig in which he had made his first appearance as a lawyer above thirty years ago this machine had been in buckle ever since and now all the servants in the family were employed to frizz it out for the occasion which was yesterday celebrated at the parish church george dennison and his bride were distinguished by nothing extraordinary in their apparel his eyes lightened with eagerness and joy and she trembled with coyness and confusion my uncle gave her away and her friend willis supported her during the ceremony  but my aunt and her paramour took the pas and formed indeed such a pair of originals as i believe all england could not parallel she was dressed in the stile of      and the day being cold put on a manteel of green velvet laced with gold but this was taken off by the bridegroom who threw over her shoulders a fur cloak of american sables valued at fourscore guineas a present equally agreeable and unexpected thus accoutred she was led up to the altar by mr dennison who did the office of her father lismahago advanced in the military step with his french coat reaching no farther than the middle of his thigh his campaign wig that surpasses all description and a languishing leer upon his countenance in which there seemed to be something arch and ironical the ring which he put upon her finger he had concealed till the moment it was used he now produced it with an air of selfcomplacency it was a curious antique set with rose diamonds he told us afterwards it had been in the family two hundred years and was a present from his grandmother these circumstances agreeably flattered the pride of our aunt tabitha which had already found uncommon gratification in the captains generosity for he had in the morning presented my uncle with a fine bears skin and a spanish fowlingpiece and me with a case of pistols curiously mounted with silver at the same time he gave mrs jenkins an indian purse made of silk grass containing twenty crown pieces you must know this young lady with the assistance of mr loyd formed the third couple who yesterday sacrificed to hymen i wrote to you in my last that he had recourse to my mediation which i employed successfully with my uncle but mrs tabitha held out till the lovesick jenkins had two fits of the mother then she relented and those two cooing turtles were caged for lifeour aunt made an effort of generosity in furnishing the bride with her superfluities of clothes and linen and her example was followed by my sister nor did mr bramble and i neglect her on this occasion it was indeed a day of peaceofferingmr dennison insisted upon liddys accepting two bank notes of one hundred pounds each as pocketmoney and his lady gave her a diamond necklace of double that value there was besides a mutual exchange of tokens among the individuals of the two families thus happily united  as george dennison and his partner were judged improper objects of mirth jack wilson had resolved to execute some jokes on lismahago and after supper began to ply him with bumpers when the ladies had retired but the captain perceiving his drift begged for quarter alledging that the adventure in which he had engaged was a very serious matter and that it would be more the part of a good christian to pray that he might be strengthened than to impede his endeavours to finish the adventurehe was spared accordingly and permitted to ascend the nuptial couch with all his senses about himthere he and his consort sat in state like saturn and cybele while the benediction posset was drank and a cake being broken over the head of mrs tabitha lismahago the fragments were distributed among the bystanders according to the custom of the antient britons on the supposition that every person who eat of this hallowed cake should that night have a vision of the man or woman whom heaven designed should be his or her wedded mate  the weight of wilsons waggery fell upon honest humphry and his spouse who were bedded in an upper room with the usual ceremony of throwing the stockingthis being performed and the company withdrawn a sort of catterwauling ensued when jack found means to introduce a real cat shod with walnutshells which galloping along the boards made such a dreadful noise as effectually discomposed our loverswinifred screamed aloud and shrunk under the bedcloathsmr loyd believing that satan was come to buffet him in propria persona laid aside all carnal thoughts and began to pray aloud with great fervencyat length the poor animal being more afraid than either leaped into the bed and meauled with the most piteous exclamationloyd thus informed of the nature of the annoyance rose and set the door wide open so that this troublesome visitant retreated with great expedition then securing himself by means of a double bolt from a second intrusion he was left to enjoy his good fortune without further disturbance  if one may judge from the looks of the parties they are all very well satisfied with what has passedgeorge dennison and his wife are too delicate to exhibit any strong marked signs of their mutual satisfaction but their eyes are sufficiently expressivemrs tabitha lismahago is rather fulsome in signifying her approbation of the captains love while his deportment is the very pink of gallantryhe sighs and ogles and languishes at this amiable object he kisses her hand mutters ejaculations of rapture and sings tender airs and no doubt laughs internally at her folly in believing him sincerein order to shew how little his vigour was impaired by the fatigues of the preceding day he this morning danced a highland sarabrand over a naked backsword and leaped so high that i believe he would make no contemptible figure as a vaulter at sadlers wellsmr matthew loyd when asked how he relished his bargain throws up his eyes crying for what we have received lord make us thankful amenhis helpmate giggles and holds her hand before her eyes affecting to be ashamed of having been in bed with a manthus all these widgeons enjoy the novelty of their situation but perhaps their notes will be changed when they are better acquainted with the nature of the decoy  as mrs willis cannot be persuaded to stay and liddy is engaged by promise to accompany her daughter back to gloucester i fancy there will be a general migration from hence and that most of us will spend the christmas holidays at bath in which case i shall certainly find an opportunity to beat up your quartersby this time i suppose you are sick of alma mater and even ready to execute that scheme of peregrination which was last year concerted between you and  your affectionate j melford nov       to dr lewis  dear doctor  my niece liddy is now happily settled for life and captain lismahago has taken tabby off my hands so that i have nothing further to do but to comfort my friend baynard and provide for my son loyd who is also fairly joined to mrs winifred jenkins you are an excellent genius at hintsdr arbuthnot was but a type of dr lewis in that respect what you observe of the vestryclerk deserves considerationi make no doubt but matthew loyd is well enough qualified for the office but at present you must find room for him in the househis incorruptible honesty and indefatigable care will be serviceable in superintending the oeconomy of my farm tho i dont mean that he shall interfere with barns of whom i have no cause to complaini am just returned with baynard from a second trip to his house where every thing is regulated to his satisfactionhe could not however review the apartments without tears and lamentation so that he is not yet in a condition to be left alone therefore i will not part with him till the spring when he intends to plunge into the avocations of husbandry which will at once employ and amuse his attentioncharles dennison has promised to stay with him a fortnight to set him fairly afloat in his improvements and jack wilson will see him from time to time besides he has a few friends in the country whom his new plan of life will not exclude from his societyin less than a year i make no doubt but he will find himself perfectly at ease both in his mind and body for the one had dangerously affected the other and i shall enjoy the exquisite pleasure of seeing my friend rescued from misery and contempt  mrs willis being determined to return with her daughter in a few days to gloucester our plan has undergone some alteration jery has persuaded his brotherinlaw to carry his wife to bath and i believe his parents will accompany him thitherfor my part i have no intention to take that routeit must be something very extraordinary that will induce me to revisit either bath or londonmy sister and her husband baynard and i will take leave of them at gloucester and make the best of our way to brambleton hall where i desire you will prepare a good chine and turkey for our christmas dinneryou must also employ your medical skill in
