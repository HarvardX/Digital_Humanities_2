dullness eyed the setting light and flappd her wing impatient for the night guilt at the signal rowzing all her train broods over the glories of her growing reign the envenomed monsters spit their deadly foam to blast the laurel that surrounds his tomb with inextinguishable rage they burn and snakehung envy hisses over his urn but thou whose eye from passions film refined can see true greatness in an honest mind can see each virtue and each grace unite and taste the raptures of a pure delight o visit often his awful page with care and view the bright assemblage treasured there  yet deign to hear the efforts of a muse whose eye not wing his ardent flight pursues intent from this great archetype to draw or faintly shadow satires power and law pleased if from hence the unlearned may comprehend and reverence his and satires generous end   in every breast there burns an active flame the love of glory or the dread of shame the passion one though different forms it wear as brightened into hope or sunk by fear the lisping infant and the hoary sire and youth and manhood feel the heartborn fire the charms of praise the coy the modest woo and fly from glory that she may pursue as galatea  galatea lasciva puella fugit ad salices sed se cupit ante videri virg  playful on the green hides in the grove yet wishes to be seen she powerful goddess rules the wise and great bends even reluctant hermits at her feet haunts the proud city and the lowly shade and sways alike the scepter and the spade heaven thus in man it is friendly power displays to urge him on to deeds that merit praise but man vain man to folly only wife rejects the manna sent him from the skies with rapture hears corrupted passions call still proudly prone to mingle with the stall as each deceitful shadow tempts his view he for imagined substance quits the true eager to catch the visionary prize in quest of glory plunges deep in vice till madly zealous impotently vain he forfeits every praise he pants to gain thus still imperious nature plies her part and still her dictates work in every heart each power that sovereign nature bids enjoy man may corrupt but man can never destroy like mighty rivers with resistless force the passions rage obstructed in their course swell to new heights forbidden paths explore and drown those virtues which they fed before and sure the deadliest foe to virtues flame our worst of evils is perverted shame beneath this yoke what abject numbers groan the shackled slaves to folly not their own blind to ourselves by sordid fear oppressed we seek our virtues in each others breast meanly adopt anothers wild caprice anothers weakness or anothers vice each tool to hoodwinked pride so poorly great that pines in splendid wretchedness of state tired in ambitions chase would nobly yield and but for shame like sylla quit the field the demon shame paints strong the ridicule and whispers close  the world will call you fool behold yon wretch to impious madness driven believes and trembles while he scoffs at heaven by weakness strong and bold through fear alone he dreads the sneer by shallow coxcombs thrown dauntless pursues the path spinoza trod to man a

et ne brave ainsi dieu que par poltronnerie boil ep    truth justice heaven in vain shall claim their power if the heart court fantastic honor more thus virtue sinks beneath unnumberd woes when passions born her friends revolt her foes hence satires power it is her instructive part to calm the wild disorders of the heart she points the arduous height where glory lies and teaches mad ambition to be wise from foul example kindles fair desire draws good from ill from flint elicits fire like the nice be with art most subtly true from poisonous vice extracts a healing dew parody on these lines of mr pope in the nice be what art so subtly true from poisonous herbs extracts a healing dew   strips black oppression of her gay disguise and bids the hag in native horror rise strikes bloated pride and lawless rapine dead and plants the wreath of fame on virtues head nor boasts the muse imaginary power though often she mourn those ills she cannot cure the worthy court her and the worthless fear who hate her piercing eye that eye revere her awful voice the vain and vile obey and every foe to wisdom feels her sway smarts pedants as she smiles no more grow vain desponding fops resign the clouded cane hushed at her voice pert follys self is still and dullness wonders while she drops her quill her hand from vice fair virtues often has sprung as the skilled planter raises flowers from dung weak are the ties which public art can find to quell the madness of the tainted mind cunning evades securely wrapped in wiles and force strongsinewd rends the unequal toils the stream of vice impetuous drives along too deep for policy for power too strong even fair religion native of the skies scorned by the fool seeks refuge with the wise but satires arrow searches every breast she plays a ruling passion on the rest fast binds the slave that earth and heaven defied and awes him from the battery of his pride when fell corruption by her vassals crowned derides fallen justice prostrate on the ground swift to redress an injured peoples groan bold satire shakes the tyrant on her throne powerful as death defies the sordid train and slaves and sycophants surround in vain but with the friends of vice the foes of satire all truth is spleen all spirit is ill nature  well may they dread the muses fatal skill well may they tremble when she draws her quill her magic quill that like ithuriels spear displays the cloven hoof or lengthened ear bids vice and folly take unborrowd shapes turns duchesses to not these into duchesses which is but a modern art strumpets beaux to apes drags the vile whisperer from his dark abode till all the demon starts up from the toad o sordid maxim formed to screen the vile that true goodnature still must wear a smile in frowns involved her beauties stronger rise when love of virtue wakes her scorn of vice where justice calls it is cruelty to save and it is the laws goodnature hangs the knave who combats virtues foe is virtues friend then judge of satires merit by her end to guilt alone her vengeance stands confined the object of her love is all mankind they least are pained who merit satire most folly the laureats vice was chartres boast and sure it is just to gibbet high the name of fools and knaves already dead to shame often satire acts the faithful surgeons part generous and kind though painful is her art her optics all the dark disease explore her weapon lances wide the gangreend sore deep wounds hypocrisys fairseeming skin where death in ulcerous humors lurks within with caution bold she only strikes to heal though folly burns to break the friendly steel then sure no guilt impartial satire knows kind even in vengeance kind to virtues foes whose is the crime the scandal too be theirs the knave and fool are their own libellers   dare nobly then but conscious of your trust as ever warm and bold be ever just nor court applause in these degenerate days the hate of villains is extorted praise over all be steady in a noble end and show mankind that truth has yet a friend it is mean for empty praise of wit to write as foplings laugh to show their teeth are white to lash a doubtful folly with a smile or madly blaze unknown defects is vile it is doubly vile when but to prove your art you fix an arrow in a blameless heart o lost to honors call o doomed to shame thou fiend accursed thou murderer of fame fell ravisher from innocence to tear that name than life than freedom held more dear to breathe contagion over the springing flower procrustes like in wantonness of power to torture truth and virtue till they fit and die in pangs upon the rack of wit where shall thy baseness meet it is just return or what repay thy guilt but endless scorn and know immortal truth shall mock thy toil immortal truth shall bid the shaft recoil with rage redoubled wing the deadly dart and steep it is load of poison in thy heart let satire next her proper limits know and ever she strike be sure she strikes a foe nor fondly deem you spy a real fool at each gay impulse of blind ridicule before whose altar virtue often has bled and often a fated victim shall be led lo it were to be wished that lord shaftsbury had expressed himself with greater precision on this subject however thus much may be affirmed with truth   st by the general tenor of his essays on enthusiasm and the freedom of wit and humor it appears that his principal design was to recommend the way of ridicule as he calls it for the investigation of truth and detection of falsehood not only in moral but religious subjects   dly it appears no less evident that in the course of his reasonings on this question he confounds two things which are in their nature and consequences entirely different these are ridicule and good humor the latter acknowledged by all to be the best mediator in every debate the former no less regarded by most as an embroiler and incendiary though he sets out with a formal profession of proving the efficacy of wit humor and ridicule in the investigation of truth yet by shifting and mixing his terms he generally slides insensibly into mere encomiums on goodbreeding cheerfulness urbanity and free enquiry this indeed keeps something like an argument on foot and amuses the superficial reader but to a more observant eye discovers a very contemptible defect either of sincerity or penetration  the question concerning ridicule may be thus not improperly stated whether doubtful propositions of any kind can be ascertained by the application of ridicule much might be said on this question but a few words will make the matter clear to an unprejudiced mind  the disapprobation or contempt which certain objects raise in the mind of man is a particular mode of passion the objects of this passion are apparent falsehood incongruity or impropriety of some particular kinds thus the object of fear is apparent danger or probable approaching ill but who has ever dreamt of exalting the passion of fear into a standard or test of real danger the design must have been rejected as absurd because it is the work of reason only to correct and fix the passion on its proper objects the case is parallel apparent or seeming falsehoods etc are the objects of contempt but it is the work of reason only to determine whether the supposed falsehoods be real or fictitious but it is said the sense of ridicule can never be mistaken  why no more can the sense of danger  what do men never fear without reason  yes very commonly but they as often despise and laugh without reason and thus before any thing can be determined in either case reason and reason only must examine circumstances separate ideas decide upon restrain and correct the passion  hence it follows that the way of ridicule is in fact no more than a species of eloquence it applies to a passion and therefore can go no farther in the investigation of truth than any of those arts which tend to raise love pity terror rage or hatred in the heart of man consequently his lordship might have transplanted the whole system of rhetoric into his new scheme with the same propriety as he has introduced the way of ridicule itself a hopeful project this for the propagation of truth  as this seems to be the real nature and tendency of ridicule it has been generally discouraged by philosophers and divines together with every other mode of eloquence when applied to controverted opinions this discouragement from what is said above appears to have been rational and just therefore the charge laid against divines with regard to this affair by a zealous admirer of lord shaftsbury see a note on the pleasures of imagination book iii seems entirely groundless the distinction which the same author has attempted with respect to the influence of ridicule between speculative and moral truths seems no better founded it is certain that opinions are no less liable to ridicule than actions and it is no less certain that the way of ridicule cannot determine the propriety or impropriety of the one more than the truth or falsehood of the other because the same passion of contempt is equally engaged in both cases and therefore as above reason only can examine the circumstances of the action or opinion and thus six the passion on its proper objects  upon the whole this new design of discovering truth by the vague and unsteady light of ridicule puts one in mind of the honest irishman who applied his candle to the sundial in order to see how the night went   shaftsbry rears her high on reasons throne and loads the slave with honors not her own bigswoln with folly as her smiles provoke profaneness spawns pert dullness drops a joke say shall we join a while this gaping crew and prove at least the idiot may be true deride our weak forefathers musty rule who therefore smiled because they saw a fool sublimer logic now adorns our isle we therefore see a fool because we smile truth in her gloomy cave why fondly seek lo gay she sits in laughters dimpled cheek contemns each surly academick foe and courts the spruce freethinker and the beau daedalian arguments but few can trace but all can screw the muscles of their face hence mighty ridicules allconquring hand shall work herculean wonders through the land bound in the magic of her cobweb chain great warburton shall rage but rage in vain truths sacred prize the loudest horselaugh win and coxcombs vanquish berkley by a grin but you more wise reject the inverted rule that truth is ever explored by ridicule on truth on falsehood let her colors fall she throws a dazzling glare alike on all beware the mad adventrer bold and blind she hoists her sail and drives with every wind deaf as the storm to sinking virtues groan nor heeds a friends destruction or her own let cleareyd reason at the helm preside bear to the wind or stem the furious tide then mirth may urge when reason can explore this point the way that waft us to the shore though distant times be sketchd in satires page yet chief it is here is to draw the present age with wisdoms luster follys shade contrast and judge the reigning manners by the past bid britains heroes awful shades arise and ancient honor beam on modern vice point back to minds ingenuous actions fair till the sons blush at what their fathers were ever yet twas beggary the great to trust ever yet twas quite a scandal to be just when vulgar sharpers only dared a lie or falsifyd the card or coggd the dye ever lewdness the stained garb of honor wore or chastity was carted for the whore vice strutted in the plumes of freedom dressed or public spirit was the public jest ever yet indignant satires honest page was fired to vengeance by an iron age the parent and the nurse of every crime the dregs the drainings of exhausted time be ever in a just expression bold yet never degrade fair satire to a scold let no unworthy rage her form debase but let her smile and let her frown with grace in mirth be temperate decent in her spleen nor while she preaches modesty obscene deep let her wound not rankle to a sore nor call his lordship   her grace a    the muses charms with surest force assail when wrapped in ironys transparent veil her beauties halfconceald the more surprise and keener luster sparkles in her eyes then be your line with sharp encomiums graced style clodius honorable bufa chaste for memoirs air the glory of the nation cibber for ode and gordon for translation of tacitus  dart not on folly an indignant eye who ever discharged artillery on a fly laugh not at vice absurd the thought and vain to bind the tiger in so weak a chain nay more when flagrant crimes your laughter move the knave exults to smile is to approve the muses labor then success shall crown when folly feels her smile and vice her frown know next what measures to each theme belong and suit your thoughts and numbers to your song on wings proportioned to your quarry rise and stoop to earth or soar among the skies thus when prevailing folly claims a smile free the expression humble be the style in strains adapted sing the midnight toil of camps and s  s disciplined by hoyle in artless numbers paint the ambitious p   r that mounts the box and shines a charioteer for glory warm the leathern belt puts on and smacks the whip with art and rivals john or him whose moderate ambition reaches but to his hip a connoisseur in breeches proud with his sheers to clip his way to fame and grope for glory while he covers shame let satire here in milder beauty shine and gayly graceful sport along the line bid awkard folly quit her thin pretense and smile each affectation into sense not so when virtue by her guards betrayed spurned from her throne implores the muses aid when crimes which erst in kindred darkness lay rise frontless and insult the eye of day when weeping hymen veils his hallowed fires and whiterobd chastity with sighs retires and rank adultery on the marriage bed hot from cocytus rears her crimson head when private faith and public trust are sold and traitors barter liberty for gold when fell corruption dark and deep as fate saps the foundation of a tottering state when giantvice and irreligion rise on mountaind falsehoods to invade the skies  then warmer numbers glow through satires page and all her smiles are darkened into rage on eagle wing she gains parnassus height not lofty epic soars a nobler flight the conscious mountain trembles at her nod and every awful gesture speaks the god then keener indignation fires her eye then flash her lightenings and her thunders fly wide and more wide the flaming bolts are hurled till all her wrath involves the guilty world yet satire often assumes a gentler mein and beams on virtues friends a smile serene reluctant wounds but pours her balm with joy pleased to commend where merit strikes her eye but tread with caution this enchanted ground enclosed by faithless precipices round truth be your guide disdain ambitions call and if you fall with truth you greatly fall it is virtues native luster that must shine the poet can but set it in his line and who unmoved with laughter can behold a dirty pebble meanly graced with gold let real merit then adorn your lays for shame attends on prostituted praise and all your wit your most distinguished art can only prove you want an honest heart nor think the muse by satires law confined she yields description of the noblest kind great is the toil the latent soul to trace to paint the heart and catch internal grace by turns bid vice and virtue strike our eyes now bid a wolsey or sejanus rise now with a touch more sacred and refined call forth a brutus or a scipios mind here sweet or strong may every color flow here let the pencil warm the canvass glow of light and shade provoke the noble strife and wake the swelling figures into life   through ages thus has satire greatly shined the friend to truth to virtue and mankind yet the fair plant from virtue never had sprung and man was guilty ever the poet sung with joy the muse beheld each better age till glowing crimes had waked her into rage truth saw her honest spleen with just delight and bad her wing her shafts and urge their flight first on the sons of greece she proved her art and sparta felt the fierce iambick dart archilocum proprio rabies armavit iambo hor  to latium next avenging satire flew the flaming faulcion bold lucilius ense velut stricto quoties lucilius ardens infremuit rubet auditor cui frigida mens est criminibus tacita sudant praecordia culpa juv sat   drew with dauntless warmth in virtues

naso pers sat   caught the generous fire for satires bow resigned the sounding lyre each arrow polished in his hand was seen and as it grew more polished grew more keen he clothed his art in studied negligence politely sly cajoled the foes of sense seemed but to sport and trifle with the dart but while he sported stabbed them to the heart in graver strains majestic persius wrote big with a ripe exuberance of thought greatly sedate contemned a tyrants reign and lashed corruption with a calm disdain yet far from vulgar eyes removed his seat vast chains of rocks enclose the green retreat let bond conduct you through the dark profound and fair poetic scenes shall open round more ardent eloquence and boundless rage devour in juvenals exalted page his mighty numbers awed corrupted rome and swept audacious greatness to it is doom as headlong torrents thundering from on high rend the proud rock that lately braved the sky but lo the fatal victor of mankind swollen luxury  and ruin stalks behind as countless insects from the northeast pour to blast the spring and ravage every flower so barbarous millions spread contagious death the sickening laurel withered at their breath deep superstitions night the skies oerhung beneath whose baleful dews the poppy sprung no longer genius wooed the nine to love but dullness nodded in the muses grove wit spirit freedom were the sole offense nor aught was held ridiculous but sense at length again fair science shot her ray dawned in the skies and spoke returning day now satire triumph over thy flying foe whet whet thy arrows and resume thy bow see great erasmus breaks the powerful spell and wounds triumphant folly in her cell in vain the solemn cowl surrounds her face vain all her bigot cant her sowr grimace with shame compelled her giddy throne to quit and own the force of reason urged by wit twas then plain done in honest vengeance rose his wit refulgent though his rhyme were prose he midst an age of puns and pedants wrote with genuine sense and roman strength of thought yet scarce had satire well relumd her flame with grief the muse relates her countrys shame ever britain saw the foul revolt commence and treacherous wit began her war with sense then rose a shameless mercenary crew whom latest time with just contempt shall view a race fantastic in whose page you see untutored fancy a mere jeu desprit

turns of wit surprise and puff poetic dust into your eyes perhaps some virtue was his awkward theme when the light purse inspired a darker dream when active hunger urged her lawless power or the stern bailiff thundered at the door but lo again the splendid shilling shines and the bard grows immoral as he dines proud for a jest obscene a patrons nod to martyr virtue or blaspheme his god unhappy dryden who unmoved can see the extremes of wit and meanness joined in thee flames that could mount and gain their kindred skies lowcreeping in the putrid sink of vice a muse whom truth and wisdom wooed in vain the pimp of power the prostitute to gain wreaths that should deck fair virtues form alone to strumpets traitors tyrants vilely thrown unrivaled parts the scorn of honest fame and genius

smile and shower her choicest boon on britains isle behold for pope she twines the laurel crown and leads the bard triumphant to his throne despairing guilt and dullness loath the sight as goblins vanish at approaching light the gentle thames that pours his urn fast by surveys the structure with revering eye to a clear mirror smooths his glassy tide proud to reflect a nations justest pride but oh what thoughts what numbers shall i find but faintly to express the poets mind who yonder stars effulgence can display unless he dip his pencil in the ray who paint a god unless the god inspire what catch the lightning but the speed of fire so mighty pope to make thy genius known all power is weak all numbers  but thy own for thee each muse with kind contention strove for thee the graces left

truths eternal ray burns clear and constant like the source of day like this it is beam prolifick and refined feeds warms inspirits and exalts the mind mildly dispells each wintry passions gloom and opens all the virtues into bloom this praise immortal pope to thee be given thy genius was indeed a gift from heaven hail bard unequaled in whose deathless line reason and wit with strength collected

friendship which inspired his song fair in defect and amiably wrong ye deathless names ye sons of endless praise by virtue crowned with neverfading bays say shall an artless muse if you inspire light her pale lamp at your immortal fire should she attempt o may she faultless claim a small a temporary wreath of fame if such her fate do thou fair truth descend and watchful guard her in an honest end kindly severe instruct her equal line to court no friend nor own a foe but thine but if her giddy eye should vainly quit thy sacred paths to run the maze of wit if her apostate heart should ever incline to offer incense at corruptions shrine urge urge thy power the black attempt confound and dash the smoking censer to the ground till awed to fear instructed bards may see that guilt is doomed to sink in infamy finis
