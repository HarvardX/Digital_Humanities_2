treatise iv viz an inquiry concerning virtue or merit formerly printed from an imperfect copy now corrected and publishd intire the jest set aside let us inquire about serious matters hor sat i printed first in the year mdcxcix     an inquiry c book   part i sect   section i occasion of this inquiry religion and virtue appear in many respects so nearly related that they are generally presumd inseparable companions and so willing we are to shaftesbury        believe well of their union that we hardly allow it just to speak or even think of em apart it may however be questiond whether the practice of the world in this respect be answerable to our speculation tis certain that we sometimes meet with instances which seem to make against this general supposition we have known people who having the appearance of great zeal in religion have   yet wanted even the common affections of humanity and shewn themselves extremely degenerate and corrupt others again who have paid little regard to religion and been considerd as mere atheists have yet been observd to practice the rules of morality and act in many cases with such good meaning and affection towards mankind as might seem to force an acknowledgment of their being virtuous and in general we find mere moral principles of such weight that in our dealings with men we are seldom satisfyd by the fullest assurance given us of their zeal in religion till we hear something further of their character if we are told a man is religious we still ask what are his morals but if we hear at first that he has honest moral principles and is a man of natural justice and good temper we seldom think of the other question whether he be religious and devout shaftesbury       this has given occasion to enquire what honesty or virtue is considerd by itself and in what manner it is influencd by religion how far religion necessarily implies virtue and whether it be a true saying that it is impossible for an atheist to be virtuous or share any real degree of honesty or merit and here it cannot justly be wonderd at if the method of explaining things shoud appear somewhat unusual since the subjectmatter has been so little examind and is of so nice and dangerous speculation for so much is the religious part of mankind alarmd by the freedom of some late pens and so great a jealousy is raisd everywhere on this account that whatever an author may suggest in favour of religion he will gain little credit in the cause if he allows the least advantage to any other principle on the other side the men of wit and raillery whose pleasantest entertainment is in the exposing the weak sides of religion are so desperately afraid of being drawn into any serious thoughts of it that they look upon a man as guilty of foul play who assumes the air of a free writer and at the same time preserves any regard for the principles of natural re shaftesbury       ligion they are apt to give as little quarter as they receive and are resolvd to think as ill of the morals of their antagonists as their antagonists can possibly   think of theirs neither of em it seems will allow the least advantage to the other tis as hard to persuade one sort that there is any virtue in religion as the other that there is any virtue out of the verge of their particular community so that between both an author must past his time ill who dares plead for religion and moral virtue without lessening the force of either but allowing to each its proper province and due rank woud hinder their being made enemys by detraction however it be if we woud pretend to give the least new light or explain any thing effectually within the intended compass of this inquiry tis necessary to take things pretty deep and endeavour by some short scheme to represent the original of each opinion whether natural or unnatural relating to the deity and if we can happily get clear of this thorny part of our philosophy the rest tis hopd may prove more plain and easy shaftesbury       sect   section ii state of opinions in the whole of things or in the universe either all is according to a good order and the most agreeable to a general interest or there is that which is otherwise and might possibly have been better constituted more wisely contrivd and with more advantage to the general interest of beings or of the whole if every thing which exists be according to a good order and for the best then of necessity there is no such thing as real ill in the universe nothing ill with respect to the whole whatsoever then is so as that it coud not really have been better or any way better orderd is perfectly good whatsoever in the order of the world can be calld ill must imply a possibility in the nature of the thing to have been better contrivd or orderd for if it coud not it is perfect and as it shoud be whatsoever is really ill therefore must be causd or producd either by design that is to say with knowledg and intelligence or in defect of this by hazard and mere chance shaftesbury      0   if there be any thing ill in the universe from design then that which disposes all things is no one good designing principle for either the one designing principle is itself corrupt or there is some other in being which operates contrarily and is ill if there be any ill in the universe from mere chance then a designing principle or mind whether good or bad cannot be the cause of all things and consequently if there be supposd a designing principle who is the cause only of good but cannot prevent the ill which happens from chance or from a contrary ill design then there can be supposd in reality no such thing as a superior good design or mind other than what is impotent and defective for not to correct or totally exclude that ill of chance or of a contrary ill design must proceed either from impotency or illwill whatsoever is superior in any degree over the world or rules in nature with discernment and a mind is what by universal agreement men call god if there are several such superior minds they are so many gods but if that single or those several superiors are not shaftesbury         in their nature necessarily good they rather take the name of daemon to believe therefore that every thing is governd orderd or regulated for the best by a designing principle or mind necessarily good and permanent is to be a perfect theist to believe nothing of a designing principle or mind nor any cause measure or rule of things but chance so that in nature neither the interest of the whole nor of any particulars can be said to be in the least designd pursud or aimd at is to be a perfect atheist to believe no one supreme designing principle or mind but rather two three or more tho in their nature good is to be a polytheist to believe the governing mind or minds not absolutely and necessarily good nor confind to what is best but capable of acting according to mere will or fancy is to be a daemonist there are few who think always consistently or according to   one certain hypothesis upon any subject so abstruse and intricate as the cause of all things and the oeconomy or government of the uni shaftesbury        verse for tis evident in the case of the most devout people even by their own confession that there are times when their faith hardly can support em in the belief of a supreme wisdom and that they are often tempted to judg disadvantageously of a providence and just administration in the whole that alone therefore is to be calld a mans opinion which is of any other the most habitual to him and occurs upon most occasions so that tis hard to pronounce certainly of any man that he is an atheist because unless his whole thoughts are at all seasons and on all occasions steddily bent against all supposition or imagination of design in things he is no perfect atheist in the same manner if a mans thoughts are not at all times steddy and resolute against all imagination of chance fortune or ill design in things he is no perfect theist but if anyone believes more of chance and confusion than of design he is to be esteemd more an atheist than a theist from that which most predominates or has the ascendent and in case he believes more of the prevalency of an illdesigning principle than of a good one he is rather a daemonist and may be justly so calld from the side to which the balance of his judgment most inclines shaftesbury        all these sorts both of daemonism polytheism atheism and theism may be mixd religion excludes only perfect atheism   perfect daemonists undoubtedly there are in religion because we know whole nations who worship a devil or fiend to whom they sacrifice and offer prayers and supplications in reality on no other account than because they fear him and we know very well that in some religions there are those who expresly give no other idea of god than shaftesbury         of a being arbitrary violent causing ill and ordaining to misery which in effect is the same as to substitute a daemon or devil in his room now since there are these several opinions concerning a superior power and since there may be found perhaps some persons who have no formd opinion at all upon this subject either thro scepticism negligence of thought or confusion of judgment the consideration is how any of these opinions or this want of any certain opinion may possibly consist with virtue and merit or be compatible with an honest or moral character part ii sect   section i a constitution when we reflect on any ordinary frame or constitution either of art or nature and consider how hard it is to give the least account of a particular part without a shaftesbury         competent knowledg of the whole whole and parts  we need not wonder to find ourselves at a loss in many things relating to the constitution and frame of nature herself for to what end in nature many things even whole species   of creatures refer or to what purpose they serve will be hard for anyone justly to determine but to what end the many proportions and various shapes of parts in many creatures actually serve we are able by the help of study and observation to demonstrate with great exactness we know that every creature has a private good and interest of his own which nature has compeld him to seek by all the advantages afforded him within the compass of his make we know that there is in reality a right and a wrong state of every creature and that his rightone is by nature forwarded and by himself affectionately sought there being therefore in every creature a certain interest or good interest or end in creatures  there must be also a certain end to which every thing in his constitution must naturally refer to this end if any thing either in his appetites passions or affections be not conducing but the contrary we must of necessity own it ill to him and in this manner he is ill with respect to himself as he certainly is with respect to others shaftesbury         of his kind when any such appetites or passions make him anyway injurious to them interest of the species  now if by the natural constitution of any rational creature the same irregularitys of appetite which make him ill to others make him ill also to himself and if the same regularity of affections which causes him to be good in one sense causes him to be good also in the other goodness  then is that goodness by which he is thus useful to others a real good and advantage to himself and thus virtue and interest may be found at last to agree of this we shall consider particularly in the latter part of our inquiry our first design is to see if we can clearly determine what that quality is to which we give the name of goodness or virtue private good shoud a historian or traveller describe to us a certain creature of a more solitary disposition than ever was yet heard of one who had neither mate nor fellow of any kind nothing of his own likeness towards which he stood wellaffected or inclind nor any thing without or beyond himself for which he had the least passion or concern we might be apt to say perhaps without much hesitation that this was doubtless a very melancholy  0 creature and that in this shaftesbury         unsociable and sullen state he was like to have a very disconsolate kind of life but if we were assurd that notwithstanding all appearances the creature enjoyd himself extremely had a great relish of life and was in nothing wanting to his own good we might acknowledg perhaps that the creature was no monster nor absurdly constituted as to himself private system  but we shoud hardly after all be inducd to say of him that he was a good creature however shoud it be urgd against us that such as he was the creature was still perfect in himself and therefore to be esteemd good for what had he to do with others in this sense indeed we might be forcd to acknowledg that he was a good creature if he coud be understood to be absolute and compleat in himself without any real relation to any thing in the universe besides for shoud there be any where in nature a system system of the species  of which this living creature was to be considerd as a part then coud he nowise be allowd good whilst he plainly appeard to be such a part as made rather to the harm than good of that system or whole in which he was included if therefore in the structure of this or any other animal there be any thing shaftesbury         which points beyond himself and by which he is plainly discoverd to have relation to some other being or nature besides his own then will this animal undoubtedly be esteemd a part of some other system for instance if an animal has the proportions of a male it shews he has relation to a female and the respective proportions both of the male and female will be allowd doubtless to have a jointrelation to another existence and order of things beyond themselves so that the creatures are both of em to be considerd as parts of another system which is that of a particular race or species of living creatures who have some one common nature or are provided for by some one order or constitution of things subsisting together and cooperating towards their conservation and support animal system in the same manner if a whole species of animals contribute to the existence or wellbeing of some other then is that whole species in general a part only of some other system    for instance to the existence of the spider that of the fly is absolutely necessary the heedless flight weak frame and tender body of this latter insect fit and determine him as much a prey as the rough make watchfulness and cunning shaftesbury         of the former fit him for rapine and the ensnaring part the web and wing are suted to each other and in the structure of each of these animals there is as apparent and perfect a relation to the other as in our own bodys there is a relation of limbs and organs or as in the branches or leaves of a tree we see a relation of each to the other and all in common to one root and trunk in the same manner are flies also necessary to the existence of other creatures both fowls and fish and thus are other species or kinds subservient to one another as being parts of a certain system and included in one and the same order of beings so that there is a system of all animals an animalorder or oeconomy according to which the animal affairs are regulated and disposd system of the earth now if the whole system of animals together with that of vegetables and all other things in this inferior world be properly comprehended in one system of a globe or earth and if again this globe or earth itself appears to have a real dependence on something still beyond as for example either on its sun the galaxy or its fellowplanets planetary system  then is it in shaftesbury      0  reality a part only of some other system and if it be allowd that there is in like manner a system of all things and a universal nature universal system  there can be no particular being or system which is not either good or ill in that general one of the universe for if it be insignificant and of no use it is a fault or imperfection and consequently ill in the general system therefore if any being be wholly and really ill it must be ill with respect to the universal system and then the system of the universe is ill or imperfect but if the ill of one private system be the good of others if it makes still to the good of the general system as when one creature lives by the destruction of another one thing is generated from the corruption of another or one    planetary system or vortex may swallow up another then is the ill of that private system no real ill in itself any more than the pain of breeding teeth is ill in a system or body which is so constituted that without this occasion of pain it woud suffer worse by being defective so that we cannot say of any being that it is wholly and absolutely ill absolute ill  unless we can positively shew and ascertain that what we call ill is no where good besides in any other system or with re shaftesbury        spect to any other order or oeconomy whatsoever relative ill but were there in the world any intire species of animals destructive to every other it may be justly calld an ill species as being ill in the animalsystem and if in any species of animals as in men for example one man is of a nature pernicious to the rest he is in this respect justly styld an ill man good and ill man we do not however say of anyone that he is an ill man because he has the plaguespots upon him or because he has convulsive fits which make him strike and wound such as approach him nor do we say on the other side that he is a good man when having his hands tyd up he is hinderd from doing the mischief he designs or which is in a manner the same when he abstains from executing his ill purpose thro a fear of some impending punishment or thro the allurement of some exterior reward goodness thro affection so that in a sensible creature that which is not done thro any affection at all makes neither good nor ill in the nature of that creature who then only is supposd good when the good or ill of the system to which he has relation is the immediate object of some passion or affection moving him shaftesbury        since it is therefore by affection merely that a creature is esteemd good or ill natural or unnatural our business will be to examine which are the good and natural and which the ill and unnatural affections    sect   section ii private or selfaffection in the first place then it may be observd that if there be an affection towards any subject considerd as private good which is not really such but imaginary this affection as being superfluous and detracting from the force of other requisite and good affections is in itself vitious and ill even in respect of the private interest or happiness of the creature if there can possibly be supposd in a creature such an affection towards selfgood as is actually in its natural degree conducing to his private interest and at the same time inconsistent with the publick good this may indeed be calld still a vitious affection and on this supposition a creature cannot really be good and natural in respect of his society or publick without being ill and unnatural toward himself but if the affection be shaftesbury         then only injurious to the society when it is immoderate and not so when it is moderate duly temperd and allayd then is the immoderate degree of the affection truly vitious but not the moderate and thus if there be found in any creature a more than ordinary selfconcernment or regard to private good which is inconsistent with the interest of the species or publick this must in every respect be esteemd an ill and vitious affection and this is what we commonly call †selfishness and disapprove so much in whatever creature we happen to discover it on the other side if the affection towards private or selfgood however selfish it may be esteemd is in reality not only consistent with publick good but in some measure contributing to it if it be such perhaps as for the good of the species in general every individual ought to share tis so far from being ill or blameable in any sense that it must be acknowledgd absolutely necessary to constitute a creature good for if the want of such an affection as    that towards selfpreservation be injurious to the species a creature is ill and unnatural as well thro this defect as thro the want of any other natural affection and this noone woud shaftesbury         doubt to pronounce if he saw a man who minded not any precipices which lay in his way nor made any distinction of food diet clothing or whatever else related to his health and being the same woud be averd of one who had a disposition which renderd him averse to any commerce with womankind and of consequence unfitted him thro illness of temper and not merely thro a defect of constitution for the propagation of his species or kind thus the affection towards selfgood may be a good affection or an illone for if this private affection be too strong as when the excessive love of life unfits a creature for any generous act then is it undoubtedly vitious and if vitious the creature who is movd by it is vitiously movd and can never be otherwise than vitious in some degree when movd by that affection therefore if thro such an earnest and passionate love of life a creature be accidentally inducd to do good as he might be upon the same terms inducd to do ill he is no more a good creature for this good he executes than a man is the more an honest or good man either for pleading a just cause or fighting in a good one for the sake merely of his fee or stipend shaftesbury        whatsoever therefore is done which happens to be advantageous to the species thro an affection merely towards selfgood does not imply any more goodness in the creature than as the affection itself is good let him in any particular act ever so well if at the bottom it be that selfish affection alone which moves him he is in himself still vitious nor can any creature be considerd otherwise when the passion towards selfgood tho ever so moderate is his real motive in the doing that to which a natural affection for his kind ought by right to have inclind him temper and indeed whatever exterior helps or succours an illdisposd creature may find to push him on towards the performance of any one good action there can no goodness arise in him till his temper be so far changd that in the issue he comes in earnest to    be led by some immediate affection directly and not accidentally to good and against ill for instance if one of those creatures supposd to be by nature tame gentle and favourable to mankind be contrary to his natural constitution fierce and savage we instantly remark the breach of temper and own the creature to be unnatural and corrupt if at any time after shaftesbury        wards the same creature by good fortune or right management comes to lose his fierceness and is made tame gentle and treatable like other creatures of his kind tis acknowledgd that the creature thus restord becomes good and natural suppose now that the creature has indeed a tame and gentle carriage but that it proceeds only from the fear of his keeper which if set aside his predominant passion instantly breaks out then is his gentleness not his real temper but his true and genuine nature or natural temper remaining just as it was the creature is still as ill as ever nothing therefore being properly either goodness or illness in a creature except what is from natural temper a good creature is such a one as by the natural temper or bent of his affections is carryd primarily and immediately and not secondarily and accidentally to good and against ill and an ill creature is just the contrary viz one who is wanting in right affections of force enough to carry him directly towards good and bear him out against ill or who is carryd by other affections directly to ill and against good when in general all the affections or passions are suted to the publick good or shaftesbury         good of the species as abovementiond then is the natural temper intirely good if on the contrary any requisite passion be wanting or if there be any one supernumerary or weak or anywise disserviceable or contrary to that main end then is the natural temper and consequently the creature himself in some measure corrupt and ill there is no need of mentioning either envy malice frowardness or other such hateful passions to shew in what manner they are ill    and constitute an ill creature but it may be necessary perhaps to remark that even as to kindness and love of the most natural sort such as that of any creature for its offspring if it be immoderate and beyond a certain degree it is undoubtedly vitious for thus overgreat tenderness destroys the effect of love and excessive pity renders us uncapable of giving succour hence the excess of motherly love is ownd to be a vitious fondness overgreat pity effeminacy and weakness overgreat concern for selfpreservation meanness and cowardice too little rashness and none at all or that which is contrary viz a passion leading to selfdestruction a mad and desperate depravity shaftesbury        sect   section iii but to proceed from what is esteemd mere goodness and lies within the reach and capacity of all sensible creatures to that which is calld virtue or merit and is allowd to man only reflex affection in a creature capable of forming general notions of things not only the outward beings which offer themselves to the sense are the objects of the affection but the very actions themselves and the affections of pity kindness gratitude and their contrarys being brought into the mind by reflection become objects so that by means of this reflected sense there arises another kind of affection towards those very affections themselves which have been already felt and are now become the subject of a new liking or dislike the case is the same in mental or moral subjects as in ordinary bodys or the common subjects of sense the shapes motions colours and proportions of these latter being presented to our eye there necessarily results a beauty or deformity according to the different measure ar shaftesbury        rangement and disposition of their several parts so in behaviour and actions when presented to    our understanding there must be found of necessity an apparent difference according to the regularity or irregularity of the subjects moral beauty and deformity the mind which is spectator or auditor of other minds cannot be without its eye and ear so as to discern proportion distinguish sound and scan each sentiment or thought which comes before it it can let nothing escape its censure it feels the soft and harsh the agreeable and disagreeable in the affections and finds a foul and fair a harmonious and a dissonant as really and truly here as in any musical numbers or in the outward forms or representations of sensible things nor can it withhold its admiration and extasy its aversion and scorn any more in what relates to one than to the other of these subjects so that to deny the common and natural sense of a sublime and beautiful in things will appear an †affectation merely to anyone who considers duly of this affair now as in the sensible kind of objects the species or images of bodys colours and sounds are perpetually moving before shaftesbury      0  our eyes and acting on our senses even when we sleep so in the moral and intellectual kind the forms and images of things are no less active and incumbent on the mind at all seasons and even when the real objects themselves are absent in these vagrant characters or pictures of manners which the mind of necessity figures to itself and carrys still about with it the heart cannot possibly remain neutral but constantly takes part one way or other however false or corrupt it be within itself it finds the difference as to beauty and comeliness between one heart and another one turn of affection one behaviour one sentiment and another and accordingly in all disinterested cases must approve in some measure of what is natural and honest and disapprove what is dishonest and corrupt thus the several motions inclinations passions dispositions    and consequent carriage and behaviour of creatures in the various parts of life being in several views or perspectives represented to the mind which readily discerns the good and ill towards the species or publick there arises a new trial or exercise of the heart which must either rightly and soundly affect what is just and right and disaffect what is contrary or corruptly shaftesbury         affect what is ill and disaffect what is worthy and good publick good an object and in this case alone it is we call any creature worthy or virtuous when it can have the notion of a publick interest and can attain the speculation or science of what is morally good or ill admirable or blameable right or wrong for tho we may vulgarly call an ill horse vitious yet we never say of a good one nor of any mere beast idiot or changeling tho ever so goodnaturd that he is worthy or virtuous so that if a creature be generous kind constant compassionate yet if he cannot reflect on what he himself does or sees others do so as to take notice of what is worthy or honest and make that notice or conception of worth and honesty to be an object of his affection he has not the character of being virtuous goodness and virtue  for thus and no otherwise he is capable of having a sense of right or wrong a sentiment or judgment of what is done thro just equal and good affection or the contrary unequal affection or iniquity whatsoever is done thro any unequal affection is iniquous wicked and wrong if the affection be equal found and good and the subject of the affection such as may with advantage to so shaftesbury        ciety be ever in the same manner prosecuted or affected this must necessarily constitute what we call equity and right in any action for wrong is not such action as is barely the cause of harm since at this rate a dutiful son aiming at an enemy but by mistake or ill chance happening to kill his father woud do a wrong but when any thing is done thro insufficient or unequal affection as when a son shews no concern for the safety of a father or where there is need of succour prefers an indifferent person to him this is of the nature of wrong    neither can any weakness or imperfection in the senses be the occasion of iniquity or wrong impaird sense  if the object of the mind itself be not at any time absurdly framd nor any way improper but sutable just and worthy of the opinion and affection applyd to it for if we will suppose a man who being sound and intire both in his reason and affection has nevertheless so depravd a constitution or frame of body that the natural objects are thro his organs of sense as thro ill glasses falsly conveyd and misrepresented twill be soon observd in such a persons case that since his failure is not in his principal or leading part he cannot in himself be esteemd iniquous or unjust shaftesbury        corrupt opinion tis otherwise in what relates to opinion belief or speculation for as the extravagance of judgment or belief is such that in some countrys even monkeys cats crocodiles and other vile or destructive animals have been esteemd holy and worshipd even as deitys shoud it appear to anyone of the religion or belief of those countrys that to save such a creature as a cat preferably to a parent was right and that other men who had not the same religious opinion were to be treated as enemys till converted this woud be certainly wrong and wicked in the believer and every action grounded on this belief woud be an iniquous wicked and vitious action right and wrong and thus whatsoever causes a misconception or misapprehension of the worth or value of any object so as to diminish a due or raise any undue irregular or unsocial affection must necessarily be the occasion of wrong thus he who affects or loves a man for the sake of something which is reputed honourable but which is in reality vitious is himself vitious and ill the beginnings of this corruption may be noted in many occurrences as when an ambitious man by the fame of his high attempts a conqueror or a pirate by his boasted enterprizes raises in another shaftesbury         person an esteem and admiration of that immoral and inhuman character which deserves abhorrence tis then that the hearer becomes corrupt when he secretly approves the ill he hears but on the other  0 side the man who loves and esteems another as believing him to have that virtue which he has not but only counterfeits is not on this account either vitious or corrupt a mistake therefore in fact being no cause or sign of ill affection can be no cause of vice but a mistake of right being the cause of unequal affection must of necessity be the cause of vitious action in every intelligent or rational being but as there are many occasions where the matter of right may even to the most discerning part of mankind appear difficult and of doubtful decision tis not a slight mistake of this kind which can destroy the character of a virtuous or worthy man but when either thro superstition or ill custom there come to be very gross mistakes in the assignment or application of the affection when the mistakes are either in their nature so gross or so complicated and frequent that a creature cannot well live in a natural state nor with due affections compatible with human society and civil life then is the character of virtue forfeited shaftesbury        and thus we find how far worth and virtue depend on a knowledg of right and wrong vice in opinion  and on a use of reason sufficient to secure a right application of the affections that nothing horrid or unnatural nothing unexemplary nothing destructive of that natural affection by which the species or society is upheld may on any account or thro any principle or notion of honour or religion be at any time affected or prosecuted as a good and proper object of esteem for such a principle as this must be wholly vitious and whatsoever is acted upon it can be no other than vice and immorality vitious worship  and thus if there be any thing which teaches men either treachery ingratitude or cruelty by divine warrant or under colour and pretence of any present or future good to mankind if there be any thing which teaches men to persecute their friends thro love or to torment captives of war in sport or to offer †human sacrifice or to torment macerate or mangle themselves    in a religious zeal before their god or to commit any sort of barbarity or brutality as amiable or becoming be it custom which gives applause or religion which gives a sanction this is not nor ever can be virtue shaftesbury         of any kind or in any sense but must remain still horrid depravity vitious custom  notwithstanding any fashion law custom or religion which may be ill and vitious itself but can never alter the eternal measures and immutable independent nature of worth and virtue sect   section iv sensible and rational objects upon the whole as to those creatures which are only capable of being movd by sensible objects they are accordingly good or vitious as the sensible affections stand with them tis otherwise in creatures capable of framing rational objects of moral good for in one of this kind shoud the sensible affections stand ever so much amiss yet if they prevail not because of those other rational affections spoken of tis evident the temper still holds good in the main and the person is with justice esteemd virtuous by all men trial of virtue more than this if by temper any one is passionate angry fearful amorous yet resists these passions and notwithstanding the force of their impression adheres to virtue we say commonly in this case that the virtue is the greater and we say well tho if that which restrains the person and holds him to a virtuouslike be shaftesbury        haviour be no affection towards goodness or virtue itself but towards private good merely he is not in reality the more virtuous as has been shewn before but this still is evident that if voluntarily and without foreign constraint an angry temper bears or an amorous one refrains so that neither any cruel or immodest action can be forcd from such a person tho ever so strongly tempted by his constitution we applaud his virtue above what we shoud naturally do if he were free of this temptation and these propensitys at the same time there is no body will say that a propensity    to vice can be an ingredient in virtue or any way necessary to compleat a virtuous character there seems therefore to be some kind of difficulty in the case but it amounts only to this if there be any part of the temper in which ill passions or affections are seated whilst in another part the affections towards moral good are such as absolutely to master those attempts of their antagonists this is the greatest proof imaginable that a strong principle of virtue lies at the bottom and has possessd itself of the natural temper whereas if there be no ill passions stirring a person may be indeed more cheaply virtuous that is to say he may conform himself to the known rules of virtue shaftesbury         without sharing so much of a virtuous principle as another yet if that other person who has the principle of virtue so strongly implanted comes at last to lose those contrary impediments supposd in him he certainly loses nothing in virtue but on the contrary losing only what is vitious in his temper is left more intire to virtue and possesses it in a higher degree degrees of virtue thus is virtue shard in different degrees by rational creatures such at least as are calld rational but who come short of that sound and wellestablishd reason which alone can constitute a just affection a uniform and steddy will and resolution and thus vice and virtue are found variously mixd and alternately prevalent in the several characters of mankind for it seems evident from our inquiry that how ill soever the temper or passions may stand with respect either to the sensible or the moral objects however passionate furious lustful or cruel any creature may become however vitious the mind be or whatever ill rules or principles it goes by yet if there be any flexibleness or favourable inclination towards the least moral object the least appearance of moral good as if there be any such thing as kindness gratitude bounty or compassion there is still something of virtue shaftesbury         left and the creature is not wholly vitious and unnatural thus a ruffian who out of a sense of fidelity and honour of any kind refuses to discover his associates and rather than betray them is content to endure torments and death has certainly    some principle of virtue however he may misapply it twas the same case with that malefactor who rather than do the office of executioner to his companions chose to keep em company in their execution in short as it seems hard to pronounce of any man that he is absolutely an atheist so it appears altogether as hard to pronounce of any man that he is absolutely corrupt or vitious there being few even of the horridest villains who have not something of virtue in this imperfect sense nothing is more just than a known saying that it is as hard to find a man wholly ill as wholly good because wherever there is any good affection left there is certainly some goodness or virtue still in being and having considerd thus of virtue what it is in itself we may now consider how it stands with respect to the opinions concerning a deity as abovementiond shaftesbury      0 part iii sect   section i causes of vice the nature of virtue consisting as has been explaind in a certain just disposition or proportionable affection of a rational creature towards the moral objects of right and wrong nothing can possibly in such a creature exclude a principle of virtue or render it ineffectual except what     either takes away the natural and just sense of right and wrong     or creates a wrong sense of it     or causes the right sense to be opposd by contrary affections of virtue on the other side nothing can assist or advance the principle of virtue except what either in some manner nourishes and promotes a sense of right and wrong or preserves it genuine and    uncorrupt or causes it when such to be obeyd by shaftesbury         subduing and subjecting the other affections to it we are to consider therefore how any of the abovementiond opinions on the subject of a deity may influence in these cases or produce either of these three effects i  loss of moral sense as to the first case the taking away the natural sense of right and wrong it will not surely be understood that by this is meant the taking away the notion of what is good or ill in the species or society for of the reality of such a good and ill no rational creature can possibly be insensible every one discerns and owns a publick interest and is conscious of what affects his fellowship or community when we say therefore of a creature that he has wholly lost the sense of right and wrong we suppose that being able to discern the good and ill of his species he has at the same time no concern for either nor any sense of excellency or baseness in any moral action relating to one or the other so that except merely with respect to a private and narrowly confind selfgood tis supposd there is in such a creature no liking or shaftesbury         dislike of manners no admiration or love of any thing as morally good nor hatred of any thing as morally ill be it ever so unnatural or deformd moral sense there is in reality no rational creature whatsoever who knows not that when he voluntarily offends or does harm to anyone he cannot fail to create an apprehension and fear of like harm and consequently a resentment and animosity in every creature who observes him so that the offender must needs be conscious of being liable to such treatment from everyone as if he had in some degree offended all thus offence and injury are always known as punishable by everyone and equal behaviour which is therefore calld merit as rewardable and welldeserving from everyone of this even the wickedest creature living must have a sense so that if there be any further meaning in this sense of right and wrong if in reality    there be any sense of this kind which an absolute wicked creature has not it must consist in a real antipathy or aversion to injustice or wrong and in a real affection or love towards equity and right for its own sake and on the account of its own natural beauty and worth shaftesbury        tis impossible to suppose a mere sensible creature originally so illconstituted and unnatural as that from the moment he comes to be tryd by sensible objects he shoud have no one good passion towards his kind no foundation either of pity love kindness or social affection tis full as impossible to conceive that a rational creature coming first to be tryd by rational objects and receiving into his mind the images or representations of justice generosity gratitude or other virtue shoud have no liking of these or dislike of their contrarys but be found absolutely indifferent towards whatsoever is presented to him of this sort a soul indeed may as well be without sense as without admiration in the things of which it has any knowledg coming therefore to a capacity of seeing and admiring in this new way it must needs find a beauty and a deformity as well in actions minds and tempers as in figures sounds or colours if there be no real amiableness or deformity in moral acts there is at least an imaginary one of full force tho perhaps the thing itself shoud not be allowd in nature the imagination or fancy of it must be allowd to be from nature alone nor can any thing besides art and strong endeavour with long practice and meditation over shaftesbury        come such a natural prevention or prepossession of the mind in favour of this moral distinction how impaird sense of right and wrong therefore being as natural to us as natural affection itself and being a first principle in our constitution and make there is no speculative opinion persuasion or belief which is capable immediately or directly to exclude or destroy it that which is of original and pure nature nothing beside contrary habit and custom a second nature is able to displace    and this affection being an original one of earliest rise in the soul or affectionate part by opposite affection or antipathy  nothing beside contrary affection by frequent check and controul can operate upon it so as either to diminish it in part or destroy it in the whole tis evident in what relates to the frame and order of our bodys that no particular odd mein or gesture which is either natural to us and consequent to our make or accidental and by habit acquird can possibly be overcome by our immediate disapprobation or the contrary bent of our will ever so strongly set against it such a change cannot be effected without extraordinary means and the intervention of art and method a strict attention and repeated check and shaftesbury         even thus nature we find is hardly masterd but lies sullen and ready to revolt on the first occasion much more is this the minds case in respect of that natural affection and anticipating fancy which makes the sense of right and wrong tis impossible that this can instantly or without much force and violence not by opinion merely  be effacd or struck out of the natural temper even by means of the most extravagant belief or opinion in the world neither theism therefore nor atheism nor daemonism nor any religious or irreligious belief of any kind being able to operate immediately or directly in this case but indirectly by the intervention of opposite or of favourable affections casually excited by any such belief we may consider of this effect in our last case where we come to examine the agreement or disagreement of other affections with this natural and moral one which relates to right and wrong sect   section ii ii  corruption of moral sense as to the second case viz the wrong sense or false imagination of right and wrong this can proceed only from the force of custom and education in opposition to shaftesbury         nature as may be noted in those countrys where according to custom or politick institution certain actions naturally foul and odious are repeatedly viewd with applause    and honour ascribd to them for thus tis possible that a man forcing himself may eat the flesh of his enemys not only against his stomach but against his nature and think it nevertheless both right and honourable as supposing it to be of considerable service to his community and capable of advancing the name and spreading the terror of his nation causes of this corruption but to speak of the opinions relating to a deity and what effect they may have in this place as to atheism it does not seem that it can directly have any effect at all towards the setting up a false species of right or wrong for notwithstanding a man may thro custom custom  or by licentiousness of practice favourd by atheism come in time to lose much of his natural moral sense yet it does not seem that atheism shoud of itself be the cause of any estimation or valuing of any thing as fair noble and deserving which was the contrary it can never for instance make it be thought that the being able to eat mans flesh or commit bestiality is good and excellent in itself but this is certain that by means of corrupt religion or superstition superstition  many things the shaftesbury         most horridly unnatural and inhuman come to be receivd as excellent good and laudable in themselves nor is this a wonder for whereever anything in its nature odious and abominable is by religion advancd as the supposd will or pleasure of a supreme deity if in the eye of the believer it appears not indeed in any respect the less ill or odious on this account then must the deity of necessity bear the blame and be considerd as a being naturally ill and odious however courted and sollicited thro mistrust and fear but this is what religion in the main forbids us to imagine it everywhere prescribes esteem and honour in company with worship and adoration whensoever therefore it teaches the love and admiration of a deity who has any apparent character of ill it teaches at the same time a love and admiration of that ill and causes that to be taken for good and amiable which is in itself horrid and detestable for instance if jupiter be he who is adord and reverencd and if his history represents him amorously inclind and permitting his desires of this kind to wander in the loosest manner tis certain    that his worshipers believing this history to be literally and strictly true must of shaftesbury         course be taught a greater love of amorous and wanton acts if there be a religion which teaches the adoration and love of a god whose character it is to be captious and of high resentment subject to wrath and anger furious revengeful and revenging himself when offended on others than those who gave the offence and if there be added to the character of this god a fraudulent disposition encouraging deceit and treachery amongst men favourable to a few tho for slight causes and cruel to the rest tis evident that such a religion as this being strongly enforcd must of necessity raise even an approbation and respect towards the vices of this kind and breed a sutable disposition a capricious partial revengeful and deceitful temper for even irregularitys and enormitys of a heinous kind must in many cases appear illustrious to one who considers them in a being admird and contemplated with the highest honour and veneration this indeed must be allowd that if in the cult or worship of such a deity there be nothing beyond common form nothing beside what proceeds from mere example custom constraint or fear if there be at the bottom no real heartiness no esteem or love implyd the worshiper perhaps may not be much shaftesbury         misled as to his notion of right and wrong if in following the precepts of his supposd god or doing what he esteems necessary towards the satisfying of such his deity he is compeld only by fear and contrary to his inclination performs an act which he secretly detests as barbarous and unnatural then has he an apprehension or sense still of right and wrong and according to what has been already observd is sensible of ill in the character of his god however cautious he may be of pronouncing any thing on this subject or so thinking of it as to frame any formal or direct opinion in the case but if by insensible degrees as he proceeds in his religious faith and devout exercise he comes to be more and more reconcild to the malignity arbitrariness pariality or revengefulness of his believd deity his reconciliation with these qualitys themselves    will soon grow in proportion and the most cruel unjust and barbarous acts will by the power of this example be often considerd by him not only as just and lawful but as divine and worthy of imitation for whoever thinks there is a god and pretends formally to believe that he is just and good must suppose that there is independently such a thing as justice and injustice truth and falshood right and shaftesbury      0  wrong according to which he pronounces that god is just righteous and true if the mere will decree or law of god be said absolutely to constitute right and wrong then are these latter words of no significancy at all for thus if each part of a contradiction were affirmd for truth by the supreme power they woud consequently become true thus if one person were decreed to suffer for anothers fault the sentence woud be just and equitable and thus in the same manner if arbitrarily and without reason some beings were destind to endure perpetual ill and others as constantly to enjoy good this also woud pass under the same denomination but to say of any thing that it is just or unjust on such a foundation as this is to say nothing or to speak without a meaning and thus it appears that where a real devotion and hearty worship is paid to a supreme being who in his history or character is represented otherwise than as really and truly just and good there must ensue a loss of rectitude a disturbance of thought and a corruption of temper and manners in the believer his honesty will of necessity be supplanted by his zeal whilst he is thus unnaturally influencd and renderd thus immorally devout shaftesbury        influence of religion to this we need only add that as the ill character of a god does injury to the affections of men and disturbs and impairs the natural sense of right and wrong so on the other hand nothing can more highly contribute to the fixing of right apprehensions and a sound judgment or sense of right and wrong than to believe a god who is ever and on all accounts represented such as to be actually a true model and example of the most exact justice and highest goodness and worth such a view of divine providence  0 and bounty extended to all and expressd in a constant good affection towards the whole must of necessity engage us within our compass and sphere to act by a like principle and affection and having once the good of our species or publick in view as our end or aim tis impossible we shoud be misguided by any means to a false apprehension or sense of right or wrong as to this second case therefore religion according as the kind may prove is capable of doing great good or harm and atheism nothing positive in either way for however it may be indirectly an occasion of mens losing a good and sufficient sense of right and wrong it will not as atheism merely shaftesbury         be the occasion of setting up a false species of it which only false religion or fantastical opinion derivd commonly from superstition and credulity is able to effect sect   section iii now as to the last case the opposition made by other affections to the natural sense of right and wrong opposition of the affections  tis evident that a creature having this sort of sense or good affection in any degree must necessarily act according to it if it happens not to be opposd either by some settled sedate affection towards a conceivd private good or by some sudden strong and forcible passion as of lust or anger which may not only subdue the sense of right and wrong but the very sense of private good itself and overrule even the most familiar and receivd opinion of what is conducing to selfinterest but it is not our business in this place to examine the several means or methods by which this corruption is introducd or increasd we are to consider only how the opinions concerning a deity can influence one way or another shaftesbury        rise of moral sense that it is possible for a creature capable of using reflection to have a liking or dislike of moral actions and consequently a    sense of right and wrong before such time as he may have any settled notion of a god is what will hardly be questiond it being a thing not expected or anyway possible that a creature such as man arising from his childhood slowly and gradually to several degrees of reason and reflection shoud at the very first be taken up with those speculations or more refind sort of reflections about the subject of gods existence let us suppose a creature who wanting reason and being unable to reflect has notwithstanding many good qualitys and affections as love to his kind courage gratitude or pity tis certain that if you give to this creature a reflecting faculty it will at the same instant approve of gratitude kindness and pity be taken with any shew or representation of the social passion and think nothing more amiable than this or more odious than the contrary and this is to be capable of virtue and to have a sense of right and wrong shaftesbury        before the time therefore that a creature can have any plain or positive notion one way or other concerning the subject of a god he may be supposd to have an apprehension or sense of right and wrong and be possessd of virtue and vice in different degrees as we know by experience of those who having livd in such places and in such a manner as never to have enterd into any serious thoughts of religion are nevertheless very different among themselves as to their characters of honesty and worth some being naturally modest kind friendly and consequently lovers of kind and friendly actions others proud harsh cruel and consequently inclind to admire rather the acts of violence and mere power deity now as to the belief of a deity and how men are influencd by it we may consider in the first place on what account men yield obedience and act in conformity to such a supreme being it must be either in the way of his power as presupposing some disadvantage or benefit to accrue from him or in the way of his excellency and worth as thinking it the perfection of nature to imitate and resemble him shaftesbury           if as in the first case there be a belief or conception of a deity hope and fear  who is considerd only as powerful over his creature and inforcing obedience to his absolute will by particular rewards and punishments and if on this account thro hope merely of reward or fear of punishment the creature be incited to do the good he hates or restraind from doing the ill to which he is not otherwise in the least degree averse there is in this case as has been already shewn no virtue or goodness whatsoever the creature notwithstanding his good conduct is intrinsecally of as little worth as if he acted in his natural way when under no dread or terror of any sort there is no more of rectitude piety or sanctity in a creature thus reformd than there is meekness or gentleness in a tiger strongly chaind or innocence and sobriety in a monkey under the discipline of the whip for however orderly and well those animals or man himself upon like terms may be inducd to act whilst the will is neither gaind nor the inclination wrought upon but awe alone prevails and forces obedience the obedience is servile and all which is done thro it merely servile the greater degree of such a submission or obedience is only the greater servility whatever shaftesbury         may be the object for whether such a creature has a good master fear  or an ill one he is neither more or less servile in his own nature be the master or superior ever so perfect or excellent yet the greater submission causd in this case thro this sole principle or motive is only the lower and more abject servitude and implies the greater wretchedness and meanness in the creature who has those passions of selflove so predominant and is in his temper so vitious and defective as has been explaind honour and love as to the second case if there be a belief or conception of a deity who is considerd as worthy and good and admird and reverencd as such being understood to have besides mere power and knowledg the highest excellence of nature such as renders him justly amiable to all and if in the manner this sovereign and mighty being is represented or as he is historically describd there appears in him a high and eminent regard to what is good and excellent a concern for the good of all and an affection of benevolence    and love towards the whole divine example  such an example must undoubtedly serve as above explaind to raise and increase the affection towards virtue and help to submit and subdue all other affections to that alone shaftesbury        nor is this good effected by example merely for where the theistical belief is intire and perfect there must be a steddy opinion of the superintendency of a supreme being a witness and spectator of human life and conscious of whatsoever is felt or acted in the universe so that in the perfectest recess or deepest solitude there must be one still presumd remaining with us whose presence singly must be of more moment than that of the most august assembly on earth in such a presense divine presence  tis evident that as the shame of guilty actions must be the greatest of any so must the honour be of welldoing even under the unjust censure of a world and in this case tis very apparent how conducing a perfect theism must be to virtue and how great deficiency there is in atheism fear and hope what the fear of future punishment and hope of future reward added to this belief may further contribute towards virtue we come now to consider more particularly so much in the mean while may be gatherd from what has been said above that neither this fear or hope can possibly be of the kind calld good affections such as are acknowledgd the springs and sources of all actions truly good nor can this fear or shaftesbury         hope as above intimated consist in reality with virtue or goodness if it either stands as essential to any moral performance or as a considerable motive to any act of which some better affection ought alone to have been a sufficient cause selflove it may be considerd withal that in this religious sort of discipline the principle of selflove how advancd  which is naturally so prevailing in us being noway moderated or restraind but rather improvd and made stronger every day by the exercise of the passions in a subject of more extended selfinterest there may be reason to apprehend lest the temper of this kind shoud extend itself in general thro all the parts of life for if the habit be such as to occasion in every    particular a stricter attention to selfgood and private interest it must insensibly diminish the affections towards publick good or the interest of society and introduce a certain narrowness of spirit which as some pretend is peculiarly observable in the devout persons and zealots of almost every religious persuasion its effects in religion this too must be confessd that if it be true piety to love god for his own sake the oversollicitous regard to private good expected from him must of necessity prove a diminution of pie shaftesbury        ty for whilst god is belovd only as the cause of private good he is no otherwise belovd than as any other instrument or means of pleasure by any vitious creature now the more there is of this violent affection towards private good the less room is there for the other sort towards goodness itself or any good and deserving object worthy of love and admiration for its own sake such as god is universally acknowledgd or at least by the generality of civilizd or refind worshipers tis in this respect that the strong desire and love of life may also prove an obstacle to piety as well as to virtue and publick love for the stronger this affection is in anyone the less will he be able to have true resignation or submission to the rule and order of the deity false resignation  and if that which he calls resignation depends only on the expectation of infinite retribution or reward he discovers no more worth or virtue here than in any other bargain of interest the meaning of his resignation being only this that he resigns his present life and pleasures conditionally for that which he himself confesses to be beyond an equivalent eternal living in a state of highest pleasure and enjoyment shaftesbury      0 but notwithstanding the injury which the principle of virtue may possibly suffer by the increase of the selfish passion in the way we have been mentioning tis certain on the other side belief of future life  that the principle of fear of future punishment and hope of future reward how mercenary or servile soever it may be accounted is yet in many circumstances how advantageous  a great advantage security and support to virtue it has been already considerd that notwithstanding there may    be implanted in the heart a real sense of right and wrong supporting  a real good affection towards the species or society yet by the violence of rage lust or any other counterworking passion this good affection may frequently be contrould and overcome where therefore there is nothing in the mind capable to render such ill passions the objects of its aversion and cause them earnestly to be opposd tis apparent how much a good temper in time must suffer and a character by degrees change for the worse but if religion interposing creates a belief that the ill passions of this kind no less than their consequent actions are the objects of a deitys animadversion tis certain that such a belief must prove a seasonable remedy shaftesbury         against vice and be in a particular manner advantageous to virtue for a belief of this kind must be supposd to tend considerably towards the calming of the mind and disposing or fitting the person to a better recollection of himself and to a stricter observance of that good and virtuous principle which needs only his attention to engage him wholly in its party and interest saving and as this belief of a future reward and punishment is capable of supporting those who thro ill practice are like to apostatize from virtue so when by ill opinion and wrong thought the mind itself is bent against the honest course and debauchd even to an esteem and deliberate preference of a vitious one the belief of the kind mentiond may prove on this occasion the only relief and safety a person for instance who has much of goodness and natural rectitude in his temper but withal so much softness or effeminacy as unfits him to bear poverty crosses or adversity if by ill fortune he meets with many trials of this kind it must certainly give a sourness and distaste to his temper and make him exceedingly averse to that which he may falsly presume the occasion shaftesbury         of such calamity or ill now if his own thoughts belief of future life  or the corrupt insinuations of other men present it often to his mind that his honesty is the occasion of this calamity and that if he were deliverd from this restraint of virtue and honesty he might be much happier tis very obvious that his esteem of these good    qualitys must in proportion diminish every day as the temper grows uneasy and quarrels with itself but if he opposes to this thought the consideration that honesty carrys with it if not a present at least a future advantage such as to compensate that loss of private good which he regrets then may this injury to his good temper and honest principle be prevented and his love or affection towards honesty and virtue remain as it was before improving in the same manner where instead of regard or love there is rather an aversion to what is good and virtuous as for instance where lenity and forgiveness are despisd and revenge highly thought of and belovd if there be this consideration added that lenity is by its rewards made the cause of a greater selfgood and enjoyment than what is found in revenge that very affection of lenity and mildness may come to be industriously nourishd and the contrary pas shaftesbury        sion depressd and thus temperance modesty candour benignity and other good affections however despisd at first may come at last to be valud for their own sakes the contrary species rejected and the good and proper object belovd and prosecuted when the reward or punishment is not so much as thought of rewards and punishments thus in a civil state or publick we see that a virtuous administration and an equal and just distribution of rewards and punishments is of the highest service not only by restraining the vitious and forcing them to act usefully to society in the state  but by making virtue to be apparently the interest of everyone so as to remove all prejudices against it create a fair reception for it and lead men into that path which afterwards they cannot easily quit for thus a people raisd from barbarity or despotick rule civilizd by laws and made virtuous by the long course of a lawful and just administration if they chance to fall suddenly under any misgovernment of unjust and arbitrary power they will on this account be the rather animated to exert a stronger virtue in opposition to such violence and corruption and even where by long and continud arts of a prevailing tyranny such a people are at last totally oppressd the scatterd seeds of virtue shaftesbury         will for a long time remain    alive even to a second generation ere the utmost force of misapplyd rewards and punishments can bring them to the abject and compliant state of longaccustomd slaves but tho a right distribution of justice in a government be so essential a cause of virtue we must observe in this case that it is example which chiefly influences mankind and forms the character and disposition of a people for a virtuous administration is in a manner necessarily accompanyd with virtue in the magistrate otherwise it coud be of little effect and of no long duration but where it is sincere and well establishd there virtue and the laws must necessarily be respected and belovd so that as to punishments and rewards their efficacy is not so much from the fear or expectation which they raise as from a natural esteem of virtue and detestation of villany which is awakend and excited by these publick expressions of the approbation and hatred of mankind in each case for in the publick executions of the greatest villains we see generally that the infamy and odiousness of their crime and the shame of it before mankind contribute more to their misery than all besides and that it is not the immediate pain or death shaftesbury         itself which raises so much horror either in the sufferers or spectators as that ignominious kind of death which is inflicted for publick crimes and violations of justice and humanity in the family and as the case of reward and punishment stands thus in the publick so in the same manner as to private familys for slaves and mercenary servants restraind and made orderly by punishment and the severity of their master are not on this account made good or honest yet the same master of the family using proper rewards and gentle punishments towards his children teaches them goodness and by this help instructs them in a virtue which afterwards they practice upon other grounds and without thinking of a penalty or bribe and this is what we call a liberal education and a liberal service the contrary service and obedience whether towards god or man being illiberal and unworthy of any honour or commendation    in the case of religion however it must be considerd in religion  that if by the hope of reward be understood the love and desire of virtuous enjoyment or of the very practice and exercise of virtue in another life the expectation or hope of this kind is so far from being derogatory to shaftesbury         virtue that it is an evidence of our loving it the more sincerely and for its own sake nor can this principle be justly calld selfish for if the love of virtue be not mere selfinterest the love and desire of life for virtues sake cannot be esteemd so but if the desire of life be only thro the violence of that natural aversion to death if it be thro the love of something else than virtuous affection or thro the unwillingness of parting with something else than what is purely of this kind then is it no longer any sign or token of real virtue thus a person loving life for lifes sake and virtue not at all may by the promise or hope of life and fear of death or other evil be inducd to practice virtue and even endeavour to be truly virtuous by a love of what he practices yet neither is this very endeavour to be esteemd a virtue for tho he may intend to be virtuous he is not become so for having only intended or aimd at it thro love of the reward but as soon as he is come to have any affection towards what is morally good and can like or affect such good for its own sake as good and amiable in itself then is he in some degree good and virtuous and not till then shaftesbury        security to virtue such are the advantages or disadvantages which accrue to virtue from reflection upon private good or interest for tho the habit of selfishness and the multiplicity of interested views are of little improvement to real merit or virtue yet there is a necessity for the preservation of virtue that it shoud be thought to have no quarrel with true interest and selfenjoyment whoever therefore by any strong persuasion or settled judgment thinks in the main that virtue causes happiness and vice misery carrys with him that security and assistance to virtue which is requird or tho he has no such thought nor can believe virtue his real interest either with respect to his own nature and constitution or the circumstances of human life yet if he    believes any supreme powers concernd in the present affairs of mankind and immediately interposing in behalf of the honest and virtuous against the impious and unjust this will serve to preserve in him however that just esteem of virtue which might otherwise considerably diminish or shoud he still believe little of the immediate interposition of provindence in the affairs of this present life yet if he believes a god dispensing rewards and punishments to vice and virtue shaftesbury         in a future he carrys with him still the same advantage and security caution  whilst his belief is steddy and nowise wavering or doubtful for it must be observd that an expectation and dependency so miraculous and great as this must naturally take off from other inferior dependencys and encouragements where infinite rewards are thus inforcd and the imagination strongly turnd towards them the other common and natural motives to goodness are apt to be neglected and lose much by disuse other interests are hardly so much as computed whilst the mind is thus transported in the pursuit of a high advantage and selfinterest so narrowly confind within ourselves on this account all other affections towards friends relations or mankind are often slightly regarded as being worldly and of little moment in respect of the interest of our soul and so little thought is there of any immediate satisfaction arising from such good offices of life imprudent zeal  that it is customary with many devout people zealously to decry all temporal advantages of goodness all natural benefits of virtue and magnifying the contrary happiness of a vitious state to declare that except only for the sake of future reward and fear of future punishment they woud divest themselves of all goodness at once and freely allow themselves to be shaftesbury         most immoral and profligate from whence it appears that in some respects there can be nothing more fatal to virtue than the weak and uncertain belief of a future reward and punishment for the stress being laid wholly here if this foundation come to fail there  0 is no further prop or security to mens morals and thus virtue is supplanted and betrayd atheism now as to atheism tho it be plainly deficient and without remedy in the case of ill judgment on the happiness of virtue yet it is not indeed of necessity the cause of any such ill judgment for without an absolute assent to any hypothesis of theism the advantages of virtue may possibly be seen and ownd and a high opinion of it establishd in the mind however it must be confessd that the natural tendency of atheism is very different tis in a manner impossible to have any great opinion of the happiness of virtue without conceiving high thoughts of the satisfaction resulting from the generous admiration and love of it and nothing beside the experience of such a love is likely to make this satisfaction credited the chief ground and support therefore of this opinion of happiness in virtue must arise from the powerful feeling of this ge shaftesbury      0 nerous moral affection and the knowledg of its power and strength but this is certain that it can be no great strengthning to the moral affection no great support to the pure love of goodness and virtue to suppose there is neither goodness nor beauty in the whole itself nor any example or precedent of good affection in any superior being such a belief must tend rather to the weaning the affections from any thing amiable or selfworthy and to the suppressing the very habit and familiar custom of admiring natural beautys or whatever in the order of things is according to just design harmony and proportion for how little disposd must a person be to love or admire any thing as orderly in the universe who thinks the universe itself a pattern of disorder how unapt to reverence or respect any particular subordinate beauty of a part when even the whole itself is thought to want perfection and to be only a vast and infinite deformity nothing indeed can be more melancholy than the thought of living in a distracted universe from whence many ills may be suspected and where there is nothing good or lovely which presents itself nothing which can satisfy in contemplation or raise any passion besides that of contempt hatred or dislike such an    opinion as this may by degrees im shaftesbury        bitter the temper and not only make the love of virtue to be less felt but help to impair and ruin the very principle of virtue viz natural and kind affection theism upon the whole whoever has a firm belief of a god whom he does not merely call good but of whom in reality he believes nothing beside real good nothing beside what is truly sutable to the exactest character of benignity and goodness such a person believing rewards or retributions in another life must believe them annexd to real goodness and merit real villany and baseness and not to any accidental qualitys or circumstances in which respect they cannot properly be styld rewards or punishments but capricious distributions of happiness or unhappiness to creatures these are the only terms on which the belief of a world to come can happily influence the believer and on these terms and by virtue of this belief man perhaps may retain his virtue and integrity even under the hardest thoughts of human nature when either by any ill circumstance or untoward doctrine he is brought to that unfortunate opinion of virtues being naturally an enemy to happiness in life this however is an opinion which cannot be supposd consistent with sound shaftesbury         theism for whatever be decided as to a future life or the rewards and punishments of hereafter he who as a sound theist believes a reigning mind sovereign in nature and ruling all things with the highest perfection of goodness as well as of wisdom and power must necessarily believe virtue to be naturally good and advantageous for what coud more strongly imply an unjust ordinance a blot and imperfection in the general constitution of things than to suppose virtue the natural ill and vice the natural good of any creature atheism and theism and now last of all there remains for us to consider a yet further advantage to virtue in the theistical belief above the atheistical the proposition may at first sight appear overrefind and of a sort which is esteemd too nicely philosophical but after what has been already examind the subject perhaps may be more easily explaind    there is no creature according to what has been already provd effects of each  who must not of necessity be ill in some degree by having any affection or aversion in a stronger degree than is sutable to his own private good or that of the system to which he is joind for in either case the affection is ill and vitious now if a ra shaftesbury        tional creature has that degree of aversion which is requisite to arm him against any particular misfortune and alarm him against the approach of any calamity this is regular and well but if after the misfortune is happend his aversion continues still and his passion rather grows upon him whilst he rages at the accident and exclaims against his private fortune or lot this will be acknowledgd both vitious in present and for the future as it affects the temper and disturbs that easy course of the affections on which virtue and goodness so much depend on the other side the patient enduring of the calamity and the bearing up of the mind under it must be acknowledgd immediately virtuous and preservative of virtue now of atheism  according to the hypothesis of those who exclude a general mind it must be confessd there can nothing happen in the course of things to deserve either our admiration and love or our anger and abhorrence however as there can be no satisfaction at the best in thinking upon what atoms and chance produce so upon disasterous occasions and under the circumstances of a calamitous and hard fortune tis scarce possible to prevent a natural kind of abhorrence and spleen which will be entertaind and kept alive by the imagination of so perverse an order of things shaftesbury         but in another hypothesis that of perfect theism it is understood of theism  that whatever the order of the world produces is in the main both just and good therefore in the course of things in this world whatever hardship of events may seem to force from any rational creature a hard censure of his private condition or lot he may by reflection nevertheless come to have patience and to acquiesce in it nor is this all he may go further still in this reconciliation and from the same principle may make the lot itself an object of his good affection whilst he strives to maintain this generous fealty and stands so welldisposd towards the laws and government of his higher country    such an affection must needs create the highest constancy in any state of sufferance and make us in the best manner support whatever hardships are to be endurd for virtues sake and as this affection must of necessity cause a greater acquiescence and complacency with respect to ill accidents ill men and injurys so of course it cannot fail of producing still a greater equality gentleness and benignity in the temper consequently the affection must be a truly good one and a creature the more truly good and virtuous by possessing it for shaftesbury         whatsoever is the occasion or means of more affectionately uniting a rational creature to his part in society and causes him to prosecute the publick good or interest of his species with more zeal and affection than ordinary is undoubtedly the cause of more than ordinary virtue in such a person contemplation this too is certain that the admiration and love of order harmony and proportion in whatever kind is naturally improving to the temper advantageous to social affection and highly assistant to virtue which is itself no other than the love of order and beauty in society in the meanest subjects of the world the appearance of order gains upon the mind and draws the affection towards it but if the order of the world itself appears just and beautiful the admiration and esteem of order must run higher and the elegant passion or love of beauty which is so advantageous to virtue must be the more improvd by its exercise in so ample and magnificent a subject religious affection  for tis impossible that such a divine order shoud be contemplated without extasy and rapture since in the common subjects of science and the liberal arts whatever is according to just shaftesbury         harmony and proportion is so transporting to those who have any knowledg or practice in the kind now if the subject and ground of this divine passion be not really just or adequate the hypothesis of theism being supposd false the passion still in itself is so far natural and good as it proves an advantage to virtue and goodness according to what has been above demonstrated but if on the other side the subject    of this passion be really adequate and just the hypothesis of theism being real and not imaginary then is the passion also just and becomes absolutely due and requisite in every rational creature conclusion hence we may determine justly the relation which virtue has to piety the first being not compleat but in the latter since where the latter is wanting there can neither be the same benignity firmness or constancy the same good composure of the affections or uniformity of mind and thus the perfection and height of virtue must be owing to the belief of a god shaftesbury           book   part i sect   section i we have considerd what virtue is and to whom the character belongs it remains to inquire obligation to virtue  what obligation there is to virtue or what reason to embrace it we have found that to deserve the name of good or virtuous a creature must have all his inclinations and affections his dispositions of mind and temper sutable and agreeing with the good of his kind or of that system in which he is included and of which he constitutes a part to stand thus well affected and to have ones affections right and intire not only in respect of ones self but of society and the publick this is rectitude integrity or virtue and to be wanting in any of these or to have their shaftesbury         contrarys is depravity corruption and vice difficulty stated it has been already shewn that in the passions and affections of particular creatures there is a constant relation to the interest of a species or common nature this has been demonstrated in the case of natural affection parental kindness zeal for posterity concern for the propagation and nurture of the young love of fellowship and company compassion mutual succour and the rest of this kind nor will anyone deny that this affection of a creature towards the good of the species or common nature is as proper and natural to him as it is to any organ part or member of an animalbody or mere vegetable to work in its known course and regular way of growth tis not more natural for the stomach to digest the lungs to breathe the glands to separate juices or other intrails to perform their several offices however they may by particular impediments be sometimes disorderd or obstructed in their operations    there being allowd therefore in a creature such affections as these towards the common nature union with a kind or species  or system of the kind together with those other which regard the private nature or selfsystem it will appear that in following the first of these a shaftesbury        ffections the creature must on many occasions contradict and go against the latter how else shoud the species be preservd or what woud signify that implanted natural affection by which a creature thro so many difficultys and hazards preserves its offspring and supports its kind opposition from selfinterest it may therefore be imagind perhaps that there is a plain and absolute opposition between these two habits or affections it may be presumd that the pursuing the common interest or publick good thro the affections of one kind must be a hindrance to the attainment of private good thro the affections of another for it being taken for granted that hazards and hardships of whatever sort are naturally the ill of the private state and it being certainly the nature of those publick affections to lead often to the greatest hardships and hazards of every kind tis presently inferd that tis the creatures interest to be without any publick affection whatsoever this we know for certain that all social love friendship gratitude or whatever else is of this generous kind does by its nature take place of the selfinteresting passions draws us out of ourselves and makes us disregardful of our own convenience and safety so that shaftesbury      0  according to a known way of reasoning on selfinterest that which is of a social kind in us shoud of right be abolishd thus kindness of every sort indulgence tenderness compassion and in short all natural affection shoud be industriously suppressd and as mere folly and weakness of nature be resisted and overcome that by this means there might be nothing remaining in us which was contrary to a direct selfend nothing which might stand in opposition to a steddy and deliberate pursuit of the most narrowly confind selfinterest    according to this extraordinary hypothesis it must be taken for granted that in the system of a kind or species the interest of the private nature is directly opposite to that of the common one the interest of particulars directly opposite to that of the publick in general—a strange constitution in which it must be confessd there is much disorder and untowardness unlike to what we observe elsewhere in nature as if in any vegetable or animal body the part or member coud be supposd in a good and prosperous state as to itself when under a contrary disposition and in an unnatural growth or habit as to its whole shaftesbury        reconciliation now that this is in reality quite otherwise we shall endeavour to demonstrate so as to make appear that what men represent as an ill order and constitution in the universe by making moral rectitude appear the ill and depravity the good or advantage of a creature is in nature just the contrary that to be well affected towards the publick interest and ones own is not only consistent but inseparable and that moral rectitude or virtue must accordingly be the advantage and vice the injury and disadvantage of every creature sect   section ii contradictory notions there are few perhaps who when they consider a creature void of natural affection and wholly destitute of a communicative or social principle will suppose him at the same time either tolerably happy in himself or as he stands abroad with respect to his fellowcreatures or kind tis generally thought that such a creature as this feels slender joy in life and finds little satisfaction in the mere sensual pleasures which remain with him after the loss of social enjoyment and whatever can be calld humanity or goodnature we know that to such shaftesbury         a creature as this tis not only incident to be morose rancorous and malignant dissolute or immoral state  but that of necessity a mind or temper thus destitute of mildness and benignity must turn to that which is contrary and be    wrought by passions of a different kind such a heart as this must be a continual seat of perverse inclinations and bitter aversions raisd from a constant ill humour sourness and disquiet the consciousness of such a nature so obnoxious to mankind and to all beings which approach it must overcloud the mind with dark suspicion and jealousy alarm it with fears and horror and raise in it a continual disturbance even in the most seeming fair and secure state of fortune and in the highest degree of outward prosperity in whole this as to the compleat immoral state is what of their own accord men readily remark where there is this absolute degeneracy this total apostacy from all candour equity trust sociableness or friendship there are few who do not see and acknowledg the misery which is consequent seldom is the case misconstrud when at worst the misfortune is we look not on this depravity in part  nor consider how it stands in less degrees the calamity we think does not of necessity hold proportion with the injustice or iniquity as if to be absolutely immoral and shaftesbury         inhuman were indeed the greatest misfortune and misery but that to be so in a little degree shoud be no misery nor harm at all which to allow is just as reasonable as to own that tis the greatest ill of a body to be in the utmost manner distorted and maimd but that to lose the use only of one limb or to be impaird in some one single organ or member is no inconvenience or ill worthy the least notice inward proportion the parts and proportions of the mind their mutual relation and dependency the connexion and frame of those passions which constitute the soul or temper may easily be understood by anyone who thinks it worth his while to study this inward anatomy tis certain that the order or symmetry of this inward part is in itself no less real and exact than that of the body however tis apparent that few of us endeavour to become anatomists of this sort nor is anyone ashamd of the deepest ignorance in such a subject for tho the greatest misery and ill is generally ownd to be from disposition and temper tho tis allowd that temper may often change and that it actually varys on many occasions    much to our disadvantage yet how this matter is brought about we inquire not we never trouble ourselves to consider thorowly by what means or methods our inward constitution comes at shaftesbury         any time to be impaird or injurd the solutio continui continuity  which bodily surgeons talk of is never applyd in this case by surgeons of another sort the notion of a whole and parts is not apprehended in this science we know not what the effect is of straining any affection indulging any wrong passion or relaxing any proper and natural habit or good inclination nor can we conceive how a particular action shoud have such a sudden influence on the whole mind as to make the person an immediate sufferer we suppose rather that a man may violate his faith commit any wickedness unfamiliar to him before engage in any vice or villany without the least prejudice to himself or any misery naturally following from the ill action tis thus we hear it often said such a person has done ill indeed but what is he the worse for it yet speaking of any nature thorowly savage curst and inveterate we say truly such a one is a plague and torment to himself and we allow that thro certain humours or passions and from temper merely a man may be compleately miserable let his outward circumstances be ever so fortunate these different judgments sufficiently demonstrate that we are not accustomd to think with much cohe shaftesbury        rency on these moral subjects and that our notions in this respect are not a little confusd and contradictory fabrick or system of the affections now if the fabrick of the mind or temper appeard such to us as it really is if we saw it impossible to remove hence any one good or orderly affection or introduce any ill or disorderly one without drawing on in some degree that dissolute state which at its height is confessd to be so miserable twoud then undoubtedly be ownd that since no ill immoral or unjust action coud be committed without either a new inroad and breach on the temper and passions or a farther advancing of that execution already begun whoever did ill or acted in prejudice of his integrity goodnature or worth woud of necessity act with greater cruelty towards himself  0 than he who scrupled not to swallow what was poisonous or who with his own hands shoud voluntarily mangle or wound his outward form or constitution natural limbs or body shaftesbury        sect   section iii system explaind it has been shewn before that no animal can be said properly to act otherwise than thro affections or passions such as are proper to an animal for in convulsive fits where a creature strikes either himself or others tis a simple mechanism an engine or piece of clockwork which acts and not the animal spring of actions whatsoever therefore is done or acted by any animal as such is done only thro some affection or passion as of fear love or hatred moving him and as it is impossible that a weaker affection shoud overcome a stronger so it is impossible but that where the affections or passions are strongest in the main and form in general the most considerable party either by their force or number thither the animal must incline and according to this balance he must be governd and led to action affections three kinds the affections or passions which must influence and govern the animal are either     the natural affections which lead to the good of the publickshaftesbury             or the selfaffections which lead only to the good of the private     or such as are neither of these nor tending either to any good of the publick or private but contrarywise and which may therefore be justly styld unnatural affections so that according as these affections stand a creature must be virtuous or vitious good or ill the latter sort of these affections tis evident are wholly vitious the two former may be vitious or virtuous according to their degree    it may seem strange perhaps to speak of natural affections as too strong degrees of affection  or of selfaffections as too weak but to clear this difficulty we must call to mind what has been already explaind that natural affection may in particular cases be excessive and in an unnatural degree as when pity is so overcoming as to destroy its own end and prevent the succour and relief requird or as when love to the offspring proves such a fondness as destroys the parent and consequently the offspring itself and notwithstanding it may seem harsh shaftesbury         to call that unnatural and vitious which is only an extreme of some natural and kind affection yet tis most certain that whereever any single good affection of this sort is overgreat it must be injurious to the rest and detract in some measure from their force and natural operation for a creature possessd with such an immoderate degree of passion must of necessity allow too much to that one and too little to others of the same character and equally natural and useful as to their end and this must necessarily be the occasion of partiality and injustice whilst only one duty or natural part is earnestly followd and other parts or dutys neglected which shoud accompany it and perhaps take place and be preferd this may well be allowd true in all other respects since even religion itself considerd as a passion not of the selfish but nobler kind may in some characters be straind beyond its natural proportion and be said also to be in too high a degree for as the end of religion is to render us more perfect and accomplishd in all moral dutys and performances if by the height of devout extasy and contemplation we are rather disabled in this respect and renderd more unapt to the real dutys and offices of civil life it may be said that religion indeed is then too strong shaftesbury         in us for how possibly can we call this superstition whilst the object of the devotion is acknowledgd just and the faith orthodox tis only the excess of zeal which in this case is so transporting as to render the devout person more remiss in secular affairs and less concernd for the inferior and temporal interests of mankind now as in particular cases publick affection on the one hand may be too high so private affection may on the other hand be    too weak for if a creature be selfneglectful and insensible of danger or if he want such a degree of passion in any kind as is useful to preserve sustain or defend himself this must certainly be esteemd vitious in regard of the design and end of nature she herself discovers this in her known method and stated rule of operation tis certain that her provisionary care and concern for the whole animal must at least be equal to her concern for a single part or member now to the several parts she has given we see proper affections sutable to their interest and security so that even without our consciousness they act in their own defense and for their own benefit and preservation thus an eye in its natural state fails not to shut together of its own accord unknowingly to us by a shaftesbury      0  peculiar caution and timidity which if it wanted however we might intend the preservation of our eye we shoud not in effect be able to preserve it by any observation or forecast of our own to be wanting therefore in those principal affections which respect the good of the whole constitution must be a vice and imperfection as great surely in the principal part the soul or temper as it is in any of those inferior and subordinate parts to want the selfpreserving affections which are proper to them and thus the affections towards private good become necessary and essential to goodness for tho no creature can be calld good or virtuous merely for possessing these affections yet since it is impossible that the publick good or good of the system can be preservd without them it follows that a creature really wanting in them is in reality wanting in some degree to goodness and natural rectitude and may thus be esteemd vitious and defective tis thus we say of a creature in a kind way of reproof that he is too good when his affection towards others is so warm and zealous as to carry him even beyond his part or when he really acts beyond it not thro too warm a passion shaftesbury         of that sort but thro an overcool one of another or thro want of some selfpassion to restrain him within due bounds it may be objected here that the having the natural affections    too strong where the selfaffections are overmuch so or the having the selfaffections defective or weak where the natural affections are also weak may prove upon occasion the only cause of a creatures acting honestly and in moral proportion for thus one who is to a fault regardless of his life may with the smallest degree of natural affection do all which can be expected from the highest pitch of social love or zealous friendship and thus on the other hand a creature excessively timorous may by as exceeding a degree of natural affection perform whatever the perfectest courage is able to inspire to this it is answerd that whenever we arraign any passion as too strong or complain of any as too weak we must speak with respect to a certain constitution or oeconomy of a particular creature or species for if a passion leading to any right end be only so much the more serviceable and effectual for being strong if we may be assurd that the strength of it will not be the occasion of any distur shaftesbury        bance within nor of any disproportion between itself and other affections then consequently the passion however strong cannot be condemnd as vitious but if to have all the passions in equal proportion with it be what the constitution of the creature cannot bear so that only some passions are raisd to this height whilst others are not nor can possibly be wrought up to the same proportion then may those strong passions tho of the better kind be calld excessive for being in unequal proportion to the others and causing an ill balance in the affection at large they must of course be the occasion of inequality in the conduct and incline the party to a wrong moral practice oeconomy of the passions but to shew more particularly what is meant by the oeconomy of the passions from instances in the species or kinds below us as for the creatures who have no manner of power or means given them by nature for their defense against violence nor anything by which they can make themselves formidable to such as injure or offend them tis necessary they shoud have an extraordinary    degree of fear but little or no animosity such as might cause em to make resistance or incline em to delay their flight for in this their safety shaftesbury         lies and to this the passion of fear is serviceable by keeping the senses on the watch and holding the spirits in readiness to give the start and thus timorousness and an habitual strong passion of fear may be according to the oeconomy of a particular creature both with respect to himself and to the rest of his species on the other hand courage may be contrary to his oeconomy and therefore vitious even in one and the same species this is by nature differently orderd with respect to different sexes ages and growths the tamer creatures of the grazing kind who live in herds are different from the wilder who herd not but live in pairs only apart from company as is natural and sutable to their rapacious life yet is there found even among the former inoffensive kind a courage proportionable to their make and strength at a time of danger when the whole herd flies the bull alone makes head against the lion or whatever other invading beast of prey and shews himself conscious of his make even the female of this kind is armd we see by nature in some degree to resist violence so as not to fly a common danger as for a hind or doe or any other inoffensive and mere defenceless creature tis no way unnatural or vitious in them when the enemy approaches to shaftesbury         desert their offspring and fly for safety but for creatures who are able to make resistance and are by nature armd offensively be they of the poorest insectkind such as bees or wasps tis natural to em to be rouzd with fury and at the hazard of their lives oppose any enemy or invader of their species for by this known passion in the creature the species itself is securd when by experience tis found that the creature tho unable to repel the injury yet voluntarily exposes his life for the punishment of the invader and suffers not his kind to be injurd with impunity and of all other creatures man is in this sense the most formidable since if he thinks it just and exemplary he may possibly in his own or in his countrys cause revenge an injury on anyone living and by throwing away    his own life if he be resolute to that degree is almost certain master of anothers however strongly guarded examples of this nature have often servd to restrain those in power from using it to the utmost extent and urging their inferiors to extremity measure tone upon the whole it may be said properly to be the same with the affections or passions in an animalconstitution as with the cords or strings of a musical instrument if these tho in ever so just proportion one to another are straind be shaftesbury        yond a certain degree tis more than the instrument will bear the lute or lyre is abusd and its effect lost on the other hand if while some of the strings are duly straind others are not wound up to their due proportion then is the instrument still in disorder and its part ill performd the several species of creatures are like different sorts of instruments and even in the same species of creatures as in the same sort of instrument one is not intirely like the other nor will the same strings fit each the same degree of strength which winds up one and fits the several strings to a just harmony and concert may in another burst both the strings and instrument itself thus men who have the liveliest sense and are the easiest affected with pain or pleasure have need of the strongest influence or force of other affections such as tenderness love sociableness compassion in order to preserve a right balance within balance  and to maintain them in their duty and in the just performance of their part whilst others who are of a cooler blood or lower key need not the same allay or counterpart nor are made by nature to feel those tender and indearing affections in so exquisite a degree it might be agreeable one woud think to inquire thus into the different tunings shaftesbury         of the passions the various mixtures and allays by which men become so different from one another temper  for as the highest improvements of temper are made in human kind best or worst in man  so the greatest corruptions and degeneracys are discoverable in this race in the other species of creatures around us there is found generally an exact proportionableness constancy and regularity in all their passions and affections no failure in the care of the    offspring or of the society to which they are united no prostitution of themselves no intemperance or excess in any kind the smaller creatures who live as it were in citys as bees and ants continue the same train and harmony of life nor are they ever false to those affections which move them to operate towards their publick good even those creatures of prey who live the farthest out of society maintain we see such a conduct towards one another as is exactly sutable to the good of their own species whilst man notwithstanding the assistance of religion and the direction of laws is often found to live in less conformity with nature and by means of religion itself is often renderd the more barbarous and inhuman marks are set on men distinctions formd opinions decreed under the severest penaltys antipathys instilld and aversions raisd in men a shaftesbury        gainst the generality of their own species so that tis hard to find in any region a human society which has human laws no wonder if in such societys tis so hard to find a man who lives naturally and as a man state of the argument but having shewn what is meant by a passions being in too high or in too low a degree and thatto have any natural affection too high or any selfaffection too low tho it be often approvd as virtue is yet strictly speaking a vice and imperfection we come now to the plainer and more essential part of vice and which alone deserves to be considerd as such that is to say     when either the publick affections are weak or deficient     or the private and selfaffections too strong     or that such affections arise as are neither of these nor in any degree tending to the support either of the publick or private system otherwise than thus it is impossible any creature can be such as we call ill or vitious so that if once we shaftesbury         prove that it is really not the creatures interest to be thus vitiously affected but contrariwise we shall then have provd that it is his interest to be wholly good and virtuous since in a wholesom and sound    state of his affections such as we have describd he cannot possibly be other than sound good and virtuous in his action and behaviour our business therefore will be to prove   i that to have the natural kindly or generous affections strong and powerful towards the good of the publick is to have the chief means and power of selfenjoyment and that to want them is certain misery and ill   ii that to have the private or selfaffections too strong or beyond their degree of subordinacy to the kindly and natural is also miserable   iii and that to have the unnatural affections viz such as are neither founded on the interest of the kind or publick nor of the private person or creature himself is to be miserable in the highest degreeshaftesbury         part ii sect   section i first proof from the natural affections to begin therefore with this proof that to have the natural affections such as are founded in love complacency goodwill and in a sympathy with the kind or species is to have the chief means and power of selfenjoyment and that to want them is certain misery and ill we may inquire first what those are which we call pleasures or satisfactions pleasures of the body and mind  from whence happiness is generally computed they are according to the common distinction satisfactions and pleasures either of the body or of the mind the latter preferable that the latter of these satisfactions are the greatest is allowd by most people and may be provd by this that whenever the mind    having conceivd a high shaftesbury      00  opinion of the worth of any action or behaviour has receivd the strongest impression of this sort and is wrought up to the highest pitch or degree of passion towards the subject at such time it sets itself above all bodily pain as well as pleasure and can be noway diverted from its purpose by flattery or terror of any kind thus we see indians barbarians malefactors and even the most execrable villains for the sake of a particular gang or society or thro some cherishd notion or principle of honour or gallantry revenge or gratitude embrace any manner of hardship and defy torments and death whereas on the other hand a person being placd in all the happy circumstances of outward enjoyment surrounded with every thing which can allure or charm the sense and being then actually in the very moment of such a pleasing indulgence yet no sooner is there any thing amiss within no sooner has he conceivd any internal ail or disorder any thing inwardly vexatious or distemperd than instantly his enjoyment ceases the pleasure of sense is at an end and every means of that sort becomes ineffectual and is rejected as uneasy and subject to give distaste inference the pleasures of the mind being allowd therefore superior to those of the shaftesbury      0   body it follows that whatever can create in any intelligent being a constant flowing series or train of mental enjoyments or pleasures of the mind is more considerable to his happiness than that which can create to him a like constant course or train of sensual enjoyments or pleasures of the body mental enjoyments whence now the mental enjoyments are either actually the very natural affections themselves in their immediate operation or they wholly in a manner proceed from them and are no other than their effects if so it follows that the natural affections duly establishd in a rational creature being the only means which can procure him a constant series or succession of the mental enjoyments they are the only means which can procure him a certain and solid happiness energy of natural affections now in the first place to explain how much the natural affections are in themselves the highest pleasures and enjoyments there    shoud methinks be little need of proving this to anyone of human kind who has ever known the condition of the mind under a lively affection of love gratitude bounty generosity pity succour or whatever else is of a so shaftesbury      0  cial or friendly sort he who has ever so little knowledg of human nature is sensible what pleasure the mind perceives when it is touchd in this generous way the difference we find between solitude and company between a common company and that of friends the reference of almost all our pleasures to mutual converse and the dependence they have on society either present or imagind all these are sufficient proofs in our behalf how much the social pleasures are superior to any other may be known by visible tokens and effects the very outward features the marks and signs which attend this sort of joy are expressive of a more intense clear and undisturbd pleasure than those which attend the satisfaction of thirst hunger and other ardent appetites but more particularly still may this superiority be known from the actual prevalence and ascendency of this sort of affection over all besides whereever it presents itself with any advantage it silences and appeases every other motion of pleasure no joy merely of sense can be a match for it whoever is judg of both the pleasures will ever give the preference to the former but to be able to judg of both tis necessary to have a sense of each the honest man indeed can judg of sensual pleasure and knows its shaftesbury      0   utmost force for neither is his taste or sense the duller but on the contrary the more intense and clear on the account of his temperance and a moderate use of appetite but the immoral and profligate man can by no means be allowd a good judg of social pleasure to which he is so mere a stranger by his nature nor is it any objection here that in many natures the good affection tho really present is found to be of insufficient force for where it is not in its natural degree tis the same indeed as if it were not or had never been the less there is of this good affection in any untoward creature the greater the wonder is that it shoud at any time prevail as in the very worst of creatures it sometimes will and if it prevails but for once in any single instance it  0 shews evidently that if the affection were thorowly experiencd or known it woud prevail in all thus the charm of kind affection is superior to all other pleasure since it has the power of drawing from every other appetite or inclination and thus in the case of love to the offspring and a thousand other instances the charm is found to operate so strongly on the temper as in the midst of other temptations to render it susceptible of this shaftesbury      0   passion alone which remains as the masterpleasure and conqueror of the rest there is noone who by the least progress in science or learning has come to know barely the principles of mathematicks but has found that in the exercise of his mind on the discoverys he there makes tho merely of speculative truths he receives a pleasure and delight superior to that of sense when we have thorowly searchd into the nature of this contemplative delight we shall find it of a kind which relates not in the least to any private interest of the creature nor has for its object any selfgood or advantage of the private system the admiration joy or love turns wholly upon what is exterior and foreign to ourselves and tho the reflected joy or pleasure which arises from the notice of this pleasure once perceivd may be interpreted a selfpassion or interested regard yet the original satisfaction can be no other than what results from the love of truth proportion order and symmetry in the things without if this be the case the passion ought in reality to be rankd with natural affection for having no object within the compass of the private system it must either be esteemd superfluous and unnatural as having no tendency towards the advantage or good of shaftesbury      0   any thing in nature or it must be judgd to be what it truly is a natural joy in the contemplation of those numbers that harmony proportion and concord which supports the universal nature and is essential in the constitution and form of every particular species or order of beings but this speculative pleasure however considerable and valuable    it may be or however superior to any motion of mere sense must yet be far surpassd by virtuous motion and the exercise of benignity and goodness where together with the most delightful affection of the soul there is joind a pleasing assent and approbation of the mind to what is acted in this good disposition and honest bent for where is there on earth a fairer matter of speculation a goodlier view or contemplation than that of a beautiful proportiond and becoming action or what is there relating to us of which the consciousness and memory is more solidly and lastingly entertaining we may observe that in the passion of love between the sexes where together with the affection of a vulgar sort there is a mixture of the kind and friendly the sense or feeling of this latter is shaftesbury      0   in reality superior to the former since often thro this affection and for the sake of the person belovd the greatest hardships in the world have been submitted to and even death itself voluntarily imbracd without any expected compensation for where shoud the ground of such an expectation lie not here in this world surely for death puts an end to all nor yet hereafter in any other for who has ever thought of providing a heaven or future recompence for the suffering virtue of lovers we may observe withal in favour of the natural affections that it is not only when joy and sprightliness are mixd with them that they carry a real enjoyment above that of the sensual kind the very disturbances which belong to natural affection tho they may be thought wholly contrary to pleasure yield still a contentment and satisfaction greater than the pleasures of indulgd sense and where a series or continud succession of the tender and kind affections can be carryd on even thro fears horrors sorrows griefs the emotion of the soul is still agreeable we continue pleasd even with this melancholy aspect or sense of virtue her beauty supports itself under a cloud and in the midst of surrounding calamitys for thus when by mere illu shaftesbury      0  sion as in a tragedy the passions of this kind are skilfully excited in us we prefer the entertainment to any other of equal duration we find    by ourselves that the moving our passions in this mournful way the engaging them in behalf of merit and worth and the exerting whatever we have of social affection and human sympathy is of the highest delight and affords a greater enjoyment in the way of thought and sentiment than any thing besides can do in a way of sense and common appetite and after this manner it appears how much the mental enjoyments are actually the very natural affections themselves effects of natural affection now in the next place to explain how they proceed from them as their natural effects we may consider first that the effects of love or kind affection in a way of mental pleasure are an enjoyment of good by communication a receiving it as it were by reflection or by way of participation in the good of others and a pleasing consciousness of the actual love merited esteem or approbation of others how considerable a part of happiness arises from the former of these effects will be easily apprehended by one who is not shaftesbury      0   exceedingly ill naturd it will be considerd how many the pleasures are of sharing contentment and delight with others of receiving it in fellowship and company and gathering it in a manner from the pleasd and happy states of those around us from accounts and relations of such happinesses from the very countenances gestures voices and sounds even of creatures foreign to our kind whose signs of joy and contentment we can anyway discern so insinuating are these pleasures of sympathy and so widely diffusd thro our whole lives that there is hardly such a thing as satisfaction or contentment of which they make not an essential part as for that other effect of social love viz the consciousness of merited kindness or esteem tis not difficult to perceive how much this avails in mental pleasure and constitutes the chief enjoyment and happiness of those who are in the narrowest sense voluptuous how natural is it for the most selfish among us to be continually drawing some sort of satisfaction from a character    and pleasing ourselves in the fancy of deservd admiration and esteem for tho it be mere fancy we endeavour still to believe it truth and flatter ourselves all we can with the thought of merit of some kind and the persuasion shaftesbury      0   of our deserving well from some few at least with whom we happen to have a more intimate and familiar commerce what tyrant is there what robber or open violater of the laws of society who has not a companion or some particular set either of his own kindred or such as he calls friends with whom he gladly shares his good in whose welfare he delights and whose joy and satisfaction he makes his own what person in the world is there who receives not some impressions from the flattery or kindness of such as are familiar with him tis to this soothing hope and expectation of friendship that almost all our actions have some reference tis this which goes thro our whole lives and mixes itself even with most of our vices of this vanity ambition and luxury have a share and many other disorders of our life partake even the unchastest love borrows largely from this source so that were pleasure to be computed in the same way as other things commonly are it might properly be said that out of these two branches viz community or participation in the pleasures of others and belief of meriting well from others woud arise more than nine tenths of whatever is enjoyd in life and thus in the main sum of happiness there is scarce a single article but what shaftesbury       0  derives itself from social love and depends immediately on the natural and kind affections now such as causes are such must be their effects and therefore as natural affection or social love is perfect or imperfect so must be the content and happiness depending on it partial affection examind but lest any shoud imagine with themselves that an inferior degree of natural affection or an imperfect partial regard of this sort can supply the place of an intire sincere and truly moral one lest a small tincture of social inclination shoud be thought sufficient to answer the end of pleasure in society and give us that enjoyment    of participation and community which is so essential to our happiness we may consider first that partial affection or social love in part without regard to a compleat society or whole is in itself an inconsistency and implies an absolute contradiction whatever affection we have towards any thing besides ourselves if it be not of the natural sort towards the system or kind it must be of all other affections the most dissociable and destructive of the enjoyments of society if it be really of the natural sort and applyd only to some one part of so shaftesbury         ciety or of a species but not to the species or society itself there can be no more account given of it than of the most odd capricious or humoursom passion which may arise the person therefore who is conscious of this affection can be conscious of no merit or worth on the account of it nor can the persons on whom this capricious affection has chancd to fall be in any manner secure of its continuance or force as it has no foundation or establishment in reason so it must be easily removable and subject to alteration without reason now the variableness of such sort of passion which depends solely on capriciousness and humour and undergoes the frequent successions of alternate hatred and love aversion and inclination must of necessity create continual disturbance and disgust give an allay to what is immediately enjoyd in the way of friendship and society and in the end extinguish in a manner the very inclination towards friendship and human commerce whereas on the other hand intire affection from whence integrity has its name as it is answerable to itself proportionable and rational so it is irrefragable solid and durable and as in the case of partiality or vitious friendship which has no rule or order every reflection of the mind necessarily makes to its disadvantage and lessens the enjoyment shaftesbury          so in the case of integrity the consciousness of just behaviour towards mankind in general partial affection  casts a good reflection on each friendly affection in particular and raises the enjoyment of friendship still the higher in the way of community or participation abovementiond and in the next place as partial affection is fitted only to    a short and slender enjoyment of those pleasures of sympathy or participation with others so neither is it able to derive any considerable enjoyment from that other principal branch of human happiness viz consciousness of the actual or merited esteem of others from whence shoud this esteem arise the merit surely must in itself be mean whilst the affection is so precarious and uncertain what trust can there be to a mere casual inclination or capricious liking who can depend on such a friendship as is founded on no moral rule but fantastically assignd to some single person or small part of mankind exclusive of society and the whole it may be considerd withal as a thing impossible that they who esteem or love by any other rule than that of virtue shoud place their affection on such subjects as they can long esteem or love twill be hard for them in the number of shaftesbury          their so belovd friends to find any in whom they can heartily rejoice or whose reciprocal love or esteem they can sincerely prize and enjoy nor can those pleasures be sound or lasting which are gatherd from a selfflattery and false persuasion of the esteem and love of others who are incapable of any sound esteem or love it appears therefore how much the men of narrow or partial affection must be losers in this sense and of necessity fall short in this second principal part of mental enjoyment intire affection mean while intire affection has all the opposite advantages it is equal constant accountable to itself ever satisfactory and pleasing it gains applause and love from the best and in all disinterested cases from the very worst of men we may say of it with justice that it carrys with it a consciousness of merited love and approbation from all society from all intelligent creatures and from whatever is original to all other intelligence and if there be in nature any such original we may add that the satisfaction which attends intire affection is full and noble in proportion to its final object which contains all perfection according to the sense of theism abovenoted for this as has been shewn is the result of virtue and to have this intire affection or integrity shaftesbury          of mind is to live according to nature and the dictates and rules of    supreme wisdom this is morality justice piety and natural religion but lest this argument shoud appear perhaps too scholastically stated and in terms and phrases which are not of familiar use we may try whether possibly we can set it yet in a plainer light let anyone then consider well those pleasures which he receives either in private retirement contemplation study and converse with himself or in mirth jollity and entertainment with others and he will find that they are wholly founded in an easy temper free of harshness mind and temper  bitterness or distaste and in a mind or reason well composd quiet easy within itself and such as can freely bear its own inspection and review now such a mind and such a temper which fit and qualify for the enjoyment of the pleasures mentiond must of necessity be owing to the natural and good affections temper as to what relates to temper it may be considerd thus there is no state of outward prosperity or flowing fortune where inclination and desire are always satisfyd fancy and humour pleasd shaftesbury          there are almost hourly some impediments or crosses to the appetite some accidents or other from without or something from within to check the licentious course of the indulgd affections they are not always to be satisfyd by mere indulgence and when a life is guided by fancy only there is sufficient ground of contrariety and disturbance the very ordinary lassitudes uneasinesses and defects of disposition in the soundest body the interrupted course of the humours or spirits in the healthiest people and the accidental disorders common to every constitution are sufficient we know on many occasions to breed uneasiness and distaste and this in time must grow into a habit where there is nothing to oppose its progress and hinder its prevailing on the temper now the only sound opposite to ill humour is natural and kind affection for we may observe that when the mind upon reflection resolves at any time to suppress this disturbance already risen in the temper and sets about this reforming work    with heartiness and in good earnest it can no otherwise accomplish the undertaking than by introducing into the affectionate part some gentle feeling of the social and friendly kind some enlivening motion of kindness fellowship complacency or love to allay and convert that contrary motion of impatience and discontent shaftesbury         if it be said perhaps that in the case before us religious affection or devotion is a sufficient and proper remedy we answer that tis according as the kind may happily prove for if it be of the pleasant and chearful sort tis of the very kind of natural affection itself if it be of the dismal or fearful sort if it brings along with it any affection opposite to manhood generosity courage or freethought there will be nothing gaind by this application and the remedy will in the issue be undoubtedly found worse than the disease the severest reflections on our duty and the consideration merely of what is by authority and under penaltys enjoind will not by any means serve to calm us on this occasion the more dismal our thoughts are on such a subject the worse our temper will be and the readier to discover itself in harshness and austerity if perhaps by compulsion or thro any necessity or fear incumbent a different carriage be at any time effected or different maxims ownd the practice at the bottom will be still the same if the countenance be composd the heart however will not be changd the ill passion may for the time be withheld from breaking into action but will not be subdud or in shaftesbury          the least debilitated against the next occasion so that in such a breast as this whatever devotion there may be tis likely there will in time be little of an easy spirit or good temper remaining and consequently few and slender enjoyments of a mental kind if it be objected on the other hand that tho in melancholy circumstances ill humour may prevail yet in a course of outward prosperity and in the height of fortune there can nothing probably occur which shoud thus sour the temper and give it such    disrelish as is suggested we may consider that the most humourd and indulgd state is apt to receive the most disturbance from every disappointment or smallest ail and if provocations are easiest raisd and the passions of anger offence and enmity are found the highest in the most indulgd state of will and humour there is still the greater need of a supply from social affection to preserve the temper from running into savageness and inhumanity and this the case of tyrants and most unlimited potentates may sufficiently verify and demonstrate mind now as to the other part of our consideration which relates to a mind or reason well composd and easy within itself shaftesbury          upon what account this happiness may be thought owing to natural affection reflection  we may possibly resolve ourselves after this manner it will be acknowledgd that a creature such as man who from several degrees of reflection has risen to that capacity which we call reason and understanding must in the very use of this his reasoning faculty be forcd to receive reflections back into his mind of what passes in itself as well as in the affections or will in short of whatsoever relates to his character conduct or behaviour amidst his fellowcreatures and in society or shoud he be of himself unapt there are others ready to remind him and refresh his memory in this way of criticism we have all of us remembrancers enow to help us in this work nor are the greatest favourites of fortune exempted from this talk of selfinspection even flattery itself by making the view agreeable renders us more attentive this way and insnares us in the habit the vainer any person is the more he has his eye inwardly fixd upon himself and is after a certain manner employd in this homesurvey and when a true regard to ourselves cannot oblige us to this inspection a false regard to others and a fondness for reputation raises a watchful jealousy and furnishes us sufficiently with acts of reflection on our own character and conduct shaftesbury         in whatever manner we consider of this we shall find still that every reasoning or reflecting creature is by his nature forcd to    endure the review of his own mind and actions and to have representations of himself and his inward affairs constantly passing before him obvious to him and revolving in his mind now as nothing can be more grievous than this is to one who has thrown off natural affection so nothing can be more delightful to one who has preservd it with sincerity conscience there are two things which to a rational creature must be horridly offensive and grievous viz to have the reflection in his mind of any unjust action or behaviour which he knows to be naturally odious and illdeserving or of any foolish action or behaviour which he knows to be prejudicial to his own interest or happiness moral conscience the former of these is alone properly calld conscience whether in a moral or religious sense for to have awe and terror of the deity does not of itself imply conscience no one is esteemd the more conscientious for the fear of evil spirits conjurations enchantments or whatever may proceed from any unjust capricious or devilish nature now to fear shaftesbury       0  god any otherwise than as in consequence of some justly blameable and imputable act is to fear a devilish nature not a divine one nor does the fear of hell or a thousand terrors of the deity imply conscience unless where there is an apprehension of what is wrong odious morally deformd and illdeserving and where this is the case there conscience must have effect and punishment of necessity be apprehended even tho it be not expresly threatend and thus religious conscience supposes moral or natural conscience and tho the former be understood to carry with it the fear of divine punishment it has its force however from the apprehended moral deformity and odiousness of any act with respect purely to the divine presence and the natural veneration due to such a supposd being for in such a presence the shame of villany or vice must have its force independently on that farther apprehension of the magisterial capacity of such a being and his dispensation of particular rewards or punishments in a future state  0 it has been already said that no creature can maliciously and intentionally do ill without being sensible at the same time that he deserves ill and in this respect every sensible creature may be said to have shaftesbury          conscience for with all mankind and all intelligent creatures this must ever hold that what they know they deserve from everyone that they necessarily must fear and expect from all and thus suspicions and ill apprehensions must arise with terror both of men and of the deity but besides this there must in every rational creature be yet farther conscience viz from sense of deformity in what is thus illdeserving and unnatural and from a consequent shame or regret of incurring what is odious and moves aversion there scarcely is or can be any creature whom consciousness of villany as such merely does not at all offend nor any thing opprobrious or heinously imputable move or affect if there be such a one tis evident he must be absolutely indifferent towards moral good or ill if this indeed be his case twill be allowd he can be noway capable of natural affection if not of that then neither of any social pleasure or mental enjoyment as shewn above but on the contrary he must be subject to all manner of horrid unnatural and ill affection so that to want conscience or natural sense of the odiousness of crime and injustice is to be most of all miserable in life but where conscience or sense of this sort remains there consequently whatever is committed shaftesbury          against it must of necessity by means of reflection as we have shewn be continually shameful grievous and offensive a man who in a passion happens to kill his companion relents immediately on the sight of what he has done his revenge is changd into pity and his hatred turnd against himself and this merely by the power of the object on this account he suffers agonys the subject of this continually occurs to him and of this he has a constant ill remembrance and displeasing consciousness if on the other side we suppose him not to relent or suffer any real concern or shame then either he has no sense of the deformity of the crime and injustice no natural affection and consequently    no happiness or peace within or if he has any sense of moral worth or goodness it must be of a perplexd and contradictory kind he must pursue an inconsistent notion false conscience  idolize some false species of virtue and affect as noble gallant or worthy that which is irrational and absurd and how tormenting this must be to him is easy to conceive for never can such a phantom as this be reducd to any certain form never can this proteus of honour be held steddy to one shape the pursuit of it can only be vexatious and distracting there is nothing beside real virtue as has been shewn shaftesbury          which can possibly hold any proportion to esteem approbation or good conscience and he who being led by false religion or prevailing custom has learnt to esteem or admire any thing as virtue which is not really such must either thro the inconsistency of such an esteem and the perpetual immoralitys occasiond by it come at last to lose all conscience and so be miserable in the worst way or if he retains any conscience at all it must be of a kind never satisfactory or able to bestow content for tis impossible that a cruel enthusiast or bigot a persecutor a murderer a bravo a pirate or any villain of less degree who is false to the society of mankind in general and contradicts natural affection shoud have any fixd principle at all any real standard or measure by which he can regulate his esteem or any solid reason by which to form his approbation of any one moral act and thus the more he sets up honour or advances zeal the worse he renders his nature and the more detestable his character the more he engages in the love or admiration of any action or practice as great and glorious which is in itself morally ill and vitious the more contradiction and selfdisapprobation he must incur for there being nothing more certain than this that no natural affection can be contradicted nor any unnatural one advancd shaftesbury          without a prejudice in some degree to all natural affection in general it must follow that inward deformity growing greater by the incouragement of unnatural affection there must be so much the more subject for dissatisfactory reflection the more any false principle of honour any false religion or superstition prevails    so that whatever notions of this kind are cherishd or whatever character affected which is contrary to moral equity and leads to inhumanity thro a false conscience or wrong sense of honour causes reproach from true  serves only to bring a man the more under the lash of real and just conscience shame and selfreproach nor can any one who by any pretended authority commits one single immorality be able to satisfy himself with any reason why he shoud not at another time be carryd further into all manner of villany such perhaps as he even abhors to think of and this is a reproach which a mind must of necessity make to itself upon the least violation of natural conscience in doing what is morally deformd and illdeserving tho warranted by any example or precedent amongst men or by any supposd injunction or command of higher powers shaftesbury         conscience from interest now as for that other part of conscience viz the remembrance of what was at any time unreasonably and foolishly done in prejudice of ones real interest or happiness this dissatisfactory reflection must follow still and have effect wheresoever there is a sense of moral deformity contracted by crime and injustice for even where there is no sense of moral deformity as such merely there must be still a sense of the ill merit of it with respect to god and man or tho there were a possibility of excluding for ever all thoughts or suspicions of any superior powers yet considering that this insensibility towards moral good or ill implies a total defect in natural affection and that this defect can by no dissimulation be conceald tis evident that a man of this unhappy character must suffer a very sensible loss in the friendship trust and confidence of other men and consequently must suffer in his interest and outward happiness nor can the sense of this disadvantage fail to occur to him when he sees with regret and envy the better and more grateful terms of friendship and esteem on which better people live with the rest of mankind even therefore where natural affection is wanting tis certain still that by immorality necessarily hap shaftesbury         pening thro want of such affection there must be disturbance from conscience of this sort viz from sense    of what is committed imprudently and contrary to real interest and advantage conclusion drawn from the mental pleasures from all this we may easily conclude how much our happiness depends on natural and good affection for if the chief happiness be from the mental pleasures and the chief mental pleasures are such as we have describd and are founded in natural affection it follows that to have the natural affections is to have the chief means and power of selfenjoyment the highest possession and happiness of life pleasures of the sense dependent also on natural affection now as to the pleasures of the body and the satisfactions belonging to mere sense tis evident they cannot possibly have their effect or afford any valuable enjoyment otherwise than by the means of social and natural affection to live well has no other meaning with some people than to eat and drink well vulgar epicurism  and methinks tis an unwary concession we make in favour of these pretended good livers when we join with em in honouring their way of life with the title of living fast as if they livd the fastest shaftesbury          who took the greatest pains to enjoy least of life for if our account of happiness be right the greatest enjoyments in life are such as these men pass over in their haste pleasures of the sense  and have scarce ever allowd themselves the liberty of tasting but as considerable a part of voluptuousness as is founded in the palat and as notable as the science is which depends on it one may justly presume that the ostentation of elegance imagination fancy  and a certain emulation and study how to excel in this sumptuous art of living goes very far in the raising such a high idea of it as is observd among the men of pleasure for were the circumstances of a table and company equipages services and the rest of the management withdrawn there woud be hardly left any pleasure worth acceptance even in the opinion of the most debauchd themselves a debauch the very notion of a debauch which is a sally into whatever can be imagind of pleasure and voluptuousness carrys with it a    plain reference to society or fellowship it may be calld a surfeit pleasures of the sense  or excess of eating and drinking but hardly a debauch of that kind when the excess is committed separately out of all society or fellowship and one who abuses himself in this way is often calld a sot but shaftesbury          never a debauchee the courtizans and even the commonest of women women  who live by prostitution know very well how necessary it is that everyone whom they entertain with their beauty shoud believe there are satisfactions reciprocal and that pleasures are no less given than receivd and were this imagination to be wholly taken away there woud be hardly any of the grosser sort of mankind who woud not perceive their remaining pleasure to be of slender estimation who is there can well or long enjoy any thing when alone and abstracted perfectly even in his very mind and thought from every thing belonging to society who woud not on such terms as these be presently cloyd by any sensual indulgence who woud not soon grow uneasy with his pleasure however exquisite till he had found means to impart it and make it truly pleasant to him by communicating and sharing it at least with some one single person let men imagine what they please let em suppose themselves ever so selfish or desire ever so much to follow the dictates of that narrow principle by which they woud bring nature under restraint nature will break out and in agonys disquiets and a distemperd state demonstrate evidently shaftesbury          the ill consequence of such violence the absurdity of such a device and the punishment which belongs to such a monstrous and horrid endeavour pleasures of the sense thus therefore not only the pleasures of the mind but even those of the body depend on natural affection insomuch that where this is wanting they not only lose their force but are in a manner converted into uneasiness and disgust the sensations which shoud naturally afford contentment and delight convertible into disgust  produce rather discontent and sourness and breed a wearisomness and restlessness in the disposition this we may perceive by the perpetual inconstancy and love of change variable  so remarkable in those who have nothing communicative or friendly in their pleasures    good fellowship in its abusd sense seems indeed to have something more constant and determining the company supports the humour tis the same in love insupportable  a certain tenderness and generosity of affection supports the passion which otherwise woud instantly be changd the perfectest beauty cannot of itself retain or fix it and that love which has no other foundation but relies on this exterior kind is soon turnd into aversion satiety perpetual disgust and feverishness of desire attend those who passio shaftesbury       0 nately study pleasure they best enjoy it who study to regulate their passions and by this they will come to know how absolute an incapacity there is in any thing sensual to please or give contentment where it depends not on something friendly or social something conjoind and in affinity with kind or natural affection balance of the affections but ere we conclude this article of social or natural affection we may take a general view of it and bring it once for all into the scale to prove what kind of balance it helps to make within and what the consequence may be of its deficiency or light weight there is noone of ever so little understanding in what belongs to a human constitution who knows not that without action motion and employment the body languishes and is oppressd its nourishment turns to disease the spirits unimployd abroad help to consume the parts within and nature as it were preys upon herself in the same manner the sensible and living part the soul or mind wanting its proper and natural shaftesbury          exercise is burdend and diseasd its thoughts and passions being unnaturally withheld from their due objects turn against itself and create the highest impatience and illhumour in †brutes and other creatures which have not the use of reason and reflection instance in the animal kinds  at least not after the manner of mankind tis so orderd in nature that by their daily search after food and    their application either towards the business of their livelihood or the affairs of their species or kind balance of the affections  almost their whole time is taken up and they fail not to find full imployment for their passion according to that degree of agitation to which they are fitted and which their constitution requires if any one of these creatures be taken out of his natural laborious state and placd amidst such a plenty as can profusely administer to all his appetites and wants it may be observd that as his circumstances grow thus luxuriant his temper and passions have the same growth when he comes at any time to have the accommodations of life at a cheaper and easier rate than was at first intended him by nature he is made to pay dear for em in another way by losing his natu shaftesbury         ral good disposition and the orderliness of his kind or species this needs not to be demonstrated by particular instances whoever has the least knowledg of natural history or has been an observer of the several breeds of creatures and their ways of life and propagation will easily understand this difference of orderliness between the wild and the tame of the same species the latter acquire new habits and deviate from their original nature they lose even the common instinct and ordinary ingenuity of their kind animal kinds  nor can they ever regain it whilst they continue in this pamperd state but being turnd to shift abroad they resume the natural affection and sagacity of their species they learn to unite in stricter fellowship and grow more concernd for their offspring they provide against the seasons and make the most of every advantage given by nature for the support and maintenance of their particular species against such as are foreign and hostile and thus as they grow busy and imployd they grow regular and good their petulancy and vice forsakes them with their idleness and ease mankind it happens with mankind that whilst some are by necessity confind to labour shaftesbury          others are provided with abundance of all things by the pains and labour of inferiors now if among the superior and easy sort there be not something of fit and proper imployment raisd in the room of what is wanting in common labour and toil if instead of an application to any sort of work such as has    a good and honest end in society as letters sciences arts husbandry publick affairs balance of the affections  oeconomy or the like there be a thorow neglect of all duty or imployment a settled idleness supineness and inactivity this of necessity must occasion a most relaxd and dissolute state it must produce a total disorder of the passions and break out in the strangest irregularitys imaginable we see the enormous growth of luxury in capital citys such as have been long the seat of empire we see what improvements are made in vice of every kind where numbers of men are maintaind in lazy opulence and wanton plenty tis otherwise with those who are taken up in honest and due imployment and have been well inurd to it from their youth this we may observe in the hardy remote provincials the inhabitants of smaller towns and the industrious sort of common people where tis rare to meet with any instances of those irregularitys shaftesbury          which are known in courts and palaces and in the rich foundations of easy and pamperd priests now if what we have advancd concerning an inward constitution be real and just if it be true that nature works by a just order and regulation as well in the passions and affections as in the limbs and organs which she forms if it appears withal that she has so constituted this inward part that nothing is so essential to it as exercise and no exercise so essential as that of social or natural affection it follows that where this is removd or weakend the inward part must necessarily suffer and be impaird let indolence indifference or insensibility be studyd as an art or cultivated with the utmost care the passions thus restraind will force their prison and in one way or other procure their liberty and find full employment they will be sure to create to themselves unusual and unnatural exercise where they are cut off from such as is natural and good and thus in the room of orderly and natural affection new and unnatural must be raisd and all inward order and oeconomy destroyd oeconomy one must have a very imperfect idea of the order of nature in the formation and structure of animals to imagine that shaftesbury          so great a principle so fundamental a part as that of natural affection shoud    possibly be lost or impaird without any inward ruin or subversion of the temper and frame of mind balance of the affections whoever is the least versd in this moral kind of architecture will find the inward fabrick so adjusted and the whole so nicely built fabrick  that the barely extending of a single passion a little too far or the continuance of it too long is able to bring irrecoverable ruin and misery he will find this experiencd in the ordinary case of phrenzy and distraction when the mind dwelling too long upon one subject whether prosperous or calamitous sinks under the weight of it and proves what the necessity is of a due balance and counterpoise in the affections he will find that in every different creature and distinct sex there is a different and distinct order set or suit of passions proportionable to the different order of life the different functions and capacitys assignd to each as the operations and effects are different so are the springs and causes in each system the inside work is fitted to the outward action and performance so that where habits or affections are dislodgd misplacd or changd where those belonging to one species are intermixd with those be shaftesbury         longing to another there must of necessity be confusion and disturbance within monsters all this we may observe easily by comparing the more perfect with the imperfect natures such as are imperfect from their birth by having sufferd violence within in their earliest form and inmost matrix we know how it is with monsters such as are compounded of different kinds or different sexes nor are they less monsters who are mishapen or distorted in an inward part the ordinary animals appear unnatural and monstrous when they lose their proper instincts forsake their kind neglect their offspring and pervert those functions or capacitys bestowd by nature how wretched must it be therefore for man of all other creatures to lose that sense and feeling which is proper to him as a man and sutable to his character and genius how unfortunate must it be for a creature whose dependence on society is greater than any others to lose that natural affection by which he is prompted to the good and interest of his species and community    such indeed is mans natural share of this affection that he of all other creatures balance of the affections  is plainly the least able to bear solitude nor is any thing more apparent than that there is naturally in every man shaftesbury          such a degree of social affection as inclines him to seek the familiarity and friendship of his fellows tis here that he lets loose a passion and gives reins to a desire which can hardly by any struggle or inward violence be withheld or if it be is sure to create a sadness dejection and melancholy in the mind for whoever is unsociable and voluntarily shuns society or commerce with the world must of necessity be morose and illnaturd he on the other side who is withheld by force or accident finds in his temper the ill effects of this restraint the inclination when suppressd breeds discontent and on the contrary affords a healing and enlivening joy when acting at its liberty and with full scope as we may see particularly when after a time of solitude and long absence the heart is opend the mind disburdend and the secrets of the breast unfolded to a bosomfriend this we see yet more remarkably instancd in persons of the most elevated stations even in princes monarchs and those who seem by their condition to be above ordinary human commerce and who affect a sort of distant strangeness from the rest of mankind but their carriage is not the same towards all men the wiser and better sort its true are shaftesbury          often held at a distance as unfit for their intimacy or secret trust but to compensate this there are others subtituted in their room who tho they have the least merit and are perhaps the most vile and contemptible of men are sufficient however to serve the purpose of an imaginary friendship and can become favourites in form these are the subjects of humanity in the great for these we see them often in concern and pain in these they easily confide to these they can with pleasure communicate their power and greatness be open free generous confiding bountiful as rejoicing in the action itself having no intention or aim beyond it and their interest in respect of policy often standing a quite contrary way but where neither the love of mankind nor the passion for favourites prevails the  0 tyrannical temper fails not to shew itself in its proper colours and to the life with all the bitterness cruelty and mistrust which belong to that solitary and gloomy state of uncommunicative and unfriendly greatness nor needs there any particular proof from history or present time to second this remark thus it may appear how much natural affection is predomi shaftesbury         nant how it is inwardly joind to us and implanted in our natures how interwoven with our other passions and how essential to that regular motion and course of our affections on which our happiness and selfenjoyment so immediately depend and thus we have demonstrated that as on one side to have the natural and good affections is to have the chief means and power of selfenjoyment so on the other side to want them is certain misery and ill sect   section ii  second proof from the selfpassions we are now to prove that by having the selfpassions too intense or strong a creature becomes miserable in order to this we must according to method enumerate those homeaffections which relate to the private interest or separate oeconomy of the creature such as love of life—resentment of injury—pleasure or appetite towards nourishment and the means of generation—interest or desire of those conveniences by which we are well provided for shaftesbury       0  and maintaind—emulation or love of praise and honour—indolence or love of ease and rest—these are the affections which relate to the private system and constitute whatever we call interestedness or selflove now these affections if they are moderate and within certain bounds are neither injurious to social life nor a hindrance to virtue but being in an extreme degree they become cowardice—revengefulness—luxury—avarice—vanity and ambition—sloth—and    as such are ownd vitious and ill with respect to human society selfpassions  how they are ill also with respect to the private person and are to his own disadvantage as well as that of the publick we may consider as we severally examine them love of life if there were any of these selfpassions which for the good and happiness of the creature might be opposd to natural affection and allowd to overbalance it the desire and love of life woud have the best pretence but it will be found perhaps that there is no passion which by having much allowd to it is the occasion of more disorder and misery shaftesbury         there is nothing more certain or more universally agreed than this that life may sometimes be even a misfortune and misery to inforce the continuance of it in creatures reducd to such extremity is esteemd the greatest cruelty and tho religion forbids that anyone shoud be his own reliever yet if by some fortunate accident death offers of itself it is embracd as highly welcome and on this account the nearest friends and relations often rejoice at the release of one intirely belovd even tho he himself may have been so weak as earnestly to decline death and endeavour the utmost prolongment of his own uneligible state since life therefore may frequently prove a misfortune and misery and since it naturally becomes so by being only prolongd to the infirmitys of old age since there is nothing withal more common than to see life overvalud and purchasd at such a cost as it can never justly be thought worth it follows evidently that the passion itself viz the love of life and abhorrence or dread of death if beyond a certain degree and overbalancing in the temper of any creature must lead him directly against his own interest make him upon occasion become the shaftesbury          greatest enemy to himself and necessitate him to act as such but tho it were allowd the interest and good of a creature by all courses and means whatsoever in any circumstances or at any rate to preserve life yet woud it be against his interest still to have this passion in a high degree for it woud by this    means prove ineffectual and noway conducing to its end various instances need not be given selfpassions  for what is there better known than that at all times an excessive fear betrays to danger instead of saving from it tis impossible for anyone to act sensibly and with presence of mind even in his own preservation and defense when he is strongly pressd by such a passion on all extraordinary emergences tis courage and resolution saves whilst cowardice robs us of the means of safety and not only deprives us of our defensive facultys but even runs us to the brink of ruin and makes us meet that evil which of itself woud never have invaded us but were the consequences of this passion less injurious than we have represented it must be allowd still that in itself it can be no other than miserable if it be misery to feel cowardice and be haunted by those specters and horrors shaftesbury          which are proper to the character of one who has a thorow dread of death for tis not only when dangers happen and hazards are incurrd that this sort of fear oppresses and distracts if it in the least prevails it gives no quarter so much as at the safest stillest hour of retreat and quiet every object suggests thought enough to employ it it operates when it is least observd by others and enters at all times into the pleasantest parts of life so as to corrupt and poison all enjoyment and content one may safely aver that by reason of this passion alone many a life if inwardly and closely viewd woud be found to be thorowly miserable tho attended with all other circumstances which in appearance render it happy but when we add to this the meannesses and base condescensions occasiond by such a passionate concern for living when we consider how by means of it we are driven to actions we can never view without dislike and forcd by degrees from our natural conduct into still greater crookednesses and perplexity there is noone surely so disingenuous as not to allow that life in this case becomes a sorry purchase and is passd with little freedom or satisfaction for how can this be otherwise whilst every thing which is generous and worthy even the chief relish hap shaftesbury         piness and good of life is for lifes sake abandond and renouncd    and thus it seems evident that to have this affection of desire and love of life love of life  too intense or beyond a moderate degree is against the interest of a creature and contrary to his happiness and good resentment there is another passion very different from that of fear and which in a certain degree is equally preservative to us and conducing to our safety as that is serviceable in prompting us to shun danger so is this in fortifying us against it and enabling us to repel injury and resist violence when offerd tis true that according to strict virtue and a just regulation of the affections in a wise and virtuous man such efforts towards action amount not to what is justly styld passion or commotion a man of courage may be cautious without real fear and a man of temper may resist or punish without anger but in ordinary characters there must necessarily be some mixture of the real passions themselves which however in the main are able to allay and temper one another and thus anger in a manner becomes necessary tis by this passion that one creature shaftesbury          offering violence to another is deterd from the execution whilst he observes how the attempt affects his fellow and knows by the very signs which accompany this rising motion that if the injury be carryd further it will not pass easily or with impunity tis this passion withal which after violence and hostility executed rouzes a creature in opposition and assists him in returning like hostility and harm on the invader for thus as rage and despair increase a creature grows still more terrible and being urgd to the greatest extremity finds a degree of strength and boldness unexperiencd till then and which had never risen except thro the height of provocation as to this affection therefore notwithstanding its immediate aim be indeed the ill or punishment of another yet it is plainly of the sort of those which tend to the advantage and interest of the selfsystem the animal himself and is withal in other respects contributing to the good and interest of the species but there is hardly need we shoud explain how mischievous and selfdestructive anger is if it be what we    commonly understand by that word if it be such a passion as is rash and violent in the instant of provocation or such as imprints itself deeply and causes a settled revenge and an eager vindicative pursuit no wonder indeed that so much shaftesbury          is done in mere revenge and under the weight of a deep resentment when the relief and satisfaction found in that indulgence is no other than the assuaging of the most torturous pain and the alleviating the most weighty and pressing sensation of misery the pain of this sort being for awhile removd or alleviated by the accomplishment of the desire in the ill of another leaves indeed behind it the perception of a delicious ease and an overflowing of soft and pleasing sensation yet is this in truth no better than the rack itself for whoever has experiencd racking pains can tell in what manner a sudden cessation or respite is usd to affect him from hence are those untoward delights of perverseness frowardness and an envenomd malignant disposition acting at its liberty for this is only a perpetual assuaging of anger perpetually renewd in other characters the passion arises not so suddenly or on slight causes but being once movd is not so easily quieted the dormant fury revenge being raisd once and wrought up to her highest pitch rests not till she attains her end and that attaind is easy and reposes making our succeeding relief and ease so much the more enjoyd as our preceding anguish and incumbent pain was of long duration and bitter sense certainly if among lovers and in the language of shaftesbury          gallantry the success of ardent love is calld the assuaging of a pain this other success may be far more justly termd so however soft or flattering the former pain may be esteemd this latter surely can be no pleasing one nor can it be possibly esteemd other than sound and thorow wretchedness a grating and disgustful feeling without the least mixture of any thing soft gentle or agreeable tis not very necessary to mention the ill effects of this passion in respect of our minds or bodys our private condition or circumstances of life by these particulars we may grow too tedious these are of the moral sort of subjects joind commonly with religion    and treated so rhetorically and with such inforcd repetition in publick as to be apt to raise the satiety of mankind what has been said may be enough perhaps to make this evident that to be subject to such a passion as we have been mentioning is in reality to be very unhappy and that the habit itself is a disease of the worst sort from which misery is inseparable pleasure luxury now as to luxury and what the world calls pleasure were it true as has been provd the contrary that the most considerable enjoyments were those shaftesbury          merely of the sense and were it true withal that those enjoyments of the sense lay in certain outward things capable of yielding always a due and certain portion of pleasure according to their degree and quality it woud then follow that the certain way to obtain happiness woud be to procure largely of these subjects to which happiness and pleasure were thus infallibly annexd but however fashionably we may apply the notion of good living twill hardly be found that our inward facultys are able to keep pace with these outward supplies of a luxuriant fortune and if the natural disposition and aptness from within be not concurring twill be in vain that these subjects are thus multiplyd from abroad and acquird with ever so great facility it may be observd in those who by excess have gaind a constant nauseating and distaste that they have nevertheless as constant a craving or eagerness of stomach but the appetite of this kind is false and unnatural as is that of thirst arising from a fever or contracted by habitual debauch now the satisfactions of the natural appetite in a plain way are infinitely beyond those indulgences of the most refind and elegant luxury this is often perceivd by the luxurious themselves it has been experiencd in people shaftesbury          bred after the sumptuous way and usd never to wait but to prevent appetite that when by any new turn of life they came to fall into a more natural course or for a while as on a journy or a day of sport came accidentally to experience the sweet of a plain diet recommended by due abstinence and exercise they have    with freedom ownd that it was then they receivd the highest satisfaction and delight which a table coud possibly afford on the other side it has been as often remarkd in persons accustomd to an active life and healthful exercise that having once thorowly experiencd this plainer and more natural diet they have upon a following change of life regretted their loss and undervalud the pleasures receivd from all the delicacys of luxury in comparison with those rememberd satisfactions of a preceding state tis plain that by urging nature forcing the appetite and inciting sense the keenness of the natural sensations is lost and tho thro vice or ill habit the same subjects of appetite may every day be sought with greater ardour they are enjoyd with less satisfaction tho the impatience of abstaining be greater the pleasure of indulgence is really less the palls or nauseatings which continually intervene are of the worst and most hate shaftesbury       0 ful kind of sensation hardly is there any thing tasted which is wholly free from this ill relish of a surfeited sense and ruind appetite so that instead of a constant and flowing delight afforded in such a state of life the very state itself is in reality a sickness and infirmity a corruption of pleasure and destructive of every natural and agreeable sensation so far is it from being true that in this licentious course we enjoy life best or are likely to make the most of it as to the consequences of such an indulgence how fatal to the body by diseases of many kinds and to the mind by sottishness and stupidity this needs not any explanation the consequences as to interest are plain enough such a state of impotent and unrestraind desire as it increases our wants so it must subject us to a greater dependence on others our private circumstances however plentiful or easy they may be can less easily content us ways and means must be invented to procure what may administer to such an imperious luxury as forces us to sacrifice honour to fortune and runs us out into all irregularity and extravagance of conduct the injurys we do ourselves by excess and unforbearance are then surely shaftesbury          apparent when thro an impotence of this sort and an impossibility of restraint we do    what we ourselves declare to be destructive to us but these are matters obvious of themselves pleasure  and from less than what has been said tis easy to conclude that luxury riot and debauch are contrary to real interest and to the true enjoyment of life amours there is another luxury superior to the kind we have been mentioning and which in strictness can scarce be calld a selfpassion since the sole end of it is the advantage and promotion of the species but whereas all other social affections are joind only with a mental pleasure and founded in mere kindness and love this has more added to it and is joind with a pleasure of sense such concern and care has nature shewn for the support and maintenance of the several species that by a certain indigence and kind of necessity of their natures they are made to regard the propagation of their kind now whether it be the interest or good of the animal to feel this indigence beyond a natural and ordinary degree is what we may consider having already said so much concerning natural and unnatural appetite shaftesbury          there needs less to be said on this occasion if it be allowd that to all other pleasures there is a measure of appetite belonging which cannot possibly be exceeded without prejudice to the creature even in his very capacity of enjoying pleasure it will hardly be thought that there is no certain limit or just boundary of this other appetite of the amorous kind there are other sorts of ardent sensations accidentally experiencd which we find pleasant and acceptable whilst they are held within a certain degree but which as they increase grow oppressive and intolerable laughter provokd by titillation grows an excessive pain tho it retains still the same features of delight and pleasure and tho in the case of that particular kind of itch which belongs to a distemper namd from that effect there are some who far from disliking the sensation find it highly acceptable and delightful yet it will hardly be reputed such among the more refind sort even of those who make pleasure their chief study and highest good now if there be in every sensation of mere pleasure a certain    pitch or degree of ardour which by being further advancd comes the nearer to mere rage and fury pleasure  if there be indeed a necessity of stopping somewhere and determining shaftesbury          on some boundary for the passion where can we fix our standard or how regulate ourselves but with regard to nature beyond which there is no measure or rule of things now nature may be known from what we see of the natural state of creatures and of man himself when unprejudicd by vitious education where happily anyone is bred to a natural life inurd to honest industry and sobriety and unaccustomd to any thing immoderate or intemperate he is found to have his appetites and inclinations of this sort at command nor are they on this account less able to afford him the pleasure or enjoyment of each kind on the contrary as they are more sound healthy and uninjurd by excess and abuse they must afford him proportionate satisfaction so that were both these sensations to be experimentally compard that of a virtuous course which belongd to one who livd a natural and regular life and that of a vitious course which belongd to one who was relaxd and dissolute there is no question but judgment woud be given in favour of the former without regard to consequences and only with respect to the very pleasure of sense itself shaftesbury         as to the consequences of this vice with respect to the health and vigour of the body there is no need to mention any thing the injury it does the mind tho less noticd is yet greater the hinderance of all improvement the wretched waste of time the effeminacy sloth supineness the disorder and looseness of a thousand passions thro such a relaxation and enervating of the mind are all of them effects sufficiently apparent when reflected on what the disadvantages are of this intemperance in respect of interest society and the world and what the advantages are of a contrary sobriety and selfcommand woud be to little purpose to mention tis well known there can be no slavery greater than what is consequent to the dominion and rule of such a passion of all other it is the least manageable by favour or concession    and assumes the most from privilege and indulgence what it costs us in the modesty and ingenuity of our natures and in the faith and honesty of our characters is as easily apprehended by anyone who will reflect and it will from hence appear that there is no passion which in its extravagance and excess shaftesbury          more necessarily occasions disorder and unhappiness interest now as to that passion which is esteemd peculiarly interesting as having for its aim the possession of wealth and what we call a settlement or fortune in the world if the regard towards this kind be moderate and in a reasonable degree if it occasions no passionate pursuit nor raises any ardent desire or appetite there is nothing in this case which is not compatible with virtue and even sutable and beneficial to society the publick as well as private system is advancd by the industry which this affection excites but if it grows at length into a real passion the injury and mischief it does the publick is not greater than that which it creates to the person himself such a one is in reality a selfoppressor and lies heavier on himself than he can ever do on mankind how far a coveting or avaritious temper is miserable needs not surely be explaind who knows not how small a portion of worldly matters is sufficient for a mans single use and convenience and how much his occasions and wants might be contracted and reducd if a just frugality shaftesbury          were studyd and temperance and a natural life came once to be pursud with half that application industry and art which is bestowd on sumptuousness and luxury now if temperance be in reality so advantageous and the practice as well as the consequences of it so pleasing and happy as has been before expressd there is little need on the other side to mention any thing of the miserys attending those covetous and eager desires after things which have no bounds or rule as being out of nature beyond which there can be no limits to desire for where shall we once stop when we are beyond this boundary how shall we fix or ascertain a thing wholly unnatural and unreasonable or what method what regulation shall we  0 set to mere imagination or the exorbitancy of fancy in adding expence to expence or possession to possession interest hence that known restlessness of covetous and eager minds in whatever state or degree of fortune they are placd there being no thorow or real satisfaction but a kind of insatiableness belonging to this condition for tis impossible there shoud be any real enjoyment except in consequence of natural and just appetite nor do we readily call that an enjoyment of wealth or of honour when thro shaftesbury          covetousness or ambition the desire is still forward and can never rest satisfyd with its gains but against this vice of covetousness there is enough said continually in the world and in our common way of speaking a covetous and a miserable temper has in reality one and the same signification emulation nor is there less said abroad as to the ills of that other aspiring temper which exceeds an honest emulation or love of praise and passes the bounds even of vanity and conceit such is that passion which breaks into an enormous pride and ambition now if we consider once the ease happiness and security which attend a modest disposition and quiet mind such as is of easy selfcommand fitted to every station in society and able to sute itself with any reasonable circumstances whatever twill on the first view present us with the most agreeable and winning character nor will it be found necessary after this to call to mind the excellence and good of moderation or the mischief and selfinjury of immoderate desires and conceited fond imaginations of personal advantage in such things as titles honours precedencys fame glory or vulgar astonishment admiration and applause shaftesbury         this too is obvious that as the desires of this kind are raisd and become impetuous and out of our command so the aversions and fears of the contrary part grow proportionably strong and violent and the temper accordingly suspicious jealous captious subject to apprehensions from all events and uncapable of bearing the least repulse or ordinary disappointment and hence it may be concluded that all rest and security as to what is future and    all peace contentedness and ease as to what is present is forfeited by the aspiring passions of this emulous kind and by having the appetites towards glory and outward appearance thus transporting and beyond command indolence there is a certain temper placd often in opposition to those eager and aspiring aims of which we have been speaking not that it really excludes either the passion of covetousness or ambition but because it hinders their effects and keeps them from breaking into open action tis this passion which by soothing the mind and softning it into an excessive love of rest and indolence renders high attempts impracticable and represents as insuperable the shaftesbury          difficultys of a painful and laborious course towards wealth and honours now tho an inclination to ease and a love of moderate recess and rest from action be as natural and useful to us as the inclination we have towards sleep yet an excessive love of rest and a contracted aversion to action and imployment must be a disease in the mind equal to that of a lethargy in the body how necessary action and exercise are to the body may be judgd by the difference we find between those constitutions which are accustomd and those which are wholly strangers to it and by the different health and complexion which labour and due exercise create in comparison with that habit of body we see consequent to an indulgd state of indolence and rest nor is the lazy habit ruinous to the body only the languishing disease corrupts all the enjoyments of a vigorous and healthy sense and carrys its infection into the mind where it spreads a worse contagion for however the body may for awhile hold out tis impossible that the mind in which the distemper is seated can escape without an immediate affliction and disorder the habit begets a tediousness and anxiety which influences the whole temper and converts the unnatural rest shaftesbury       0  into an unhappy sort of activity ill humour and spleen of which there has been enough said above where we considerd the want of a due balance in the affections    tis certain that as in the body when no labour or natural exercise is usd the spirits which want their due imployment turn against the constitution and find work for themselves in a destructive way so in a soul or mind unexercisd and which languishes for want of proper action and employment the thoughts and affections being obstructed in their due course and deprivd of their natural energy raise disquiet and foment a rancorous eagerness and tormenting irritation the temper from hence becomes more impotent in passion more incapable of real moderation and like prepard fuel readily takes fire by the least spark as to interest how far it is here concernd how wretched that state is in which by this habit a man is placd towards all the circumstances and affairs of life when at any time he is calld to action how subjected he must be to all inconveniences wanting to himself and deprivd of the assistance of others whilst being unfit for all offices and dutys of shaftesbury          society he yet of any other person most needs the help of it as being least able to assist or support himself all this is obvious and thus tis evident that to have this overbiassing inclination towards rest this slothful soft or effeminate temper averse to labour and imployment is to have an unavoidable mischief and attendent plague selfpassions in general thus have we considerd the selfpassions and what the consequence is of their rising beyond a moderate degree these affections as selfinteresting as they are can often we see become contrary to our real interest they betray us into most misfortunes and into the greatest of unhappinesses that of a profligate and abject character as they grow imperious and high they are the occasion that a creature in proportion becomes mean and low they are original to that which we call selfishness and give rise to that sordid disposition of which we have already spoken it appears there can be nothing so miserable in itself or so wretched in its consequence as to be thus impotent in temper thus masterd by passion and by means of it brought under the most servile subjection to the world shaftesbury            tis evident withal that as this selfishness increases in us so must a certain subtlety and feignedness of carriage which naturally accompanys it and thus the candour and ingenuity of our natures the ease and freedom of our minds must be forfeited all trust and confidence in a manner lost and suspicions jealousys and envys multiplyd a separate end and interest must be every day more strongly formd in us generous views and motives laid aside and the more we are thus sensibly disjoind every day from society and our fellows the worse opinion we shall have of those uniting passions which bind us in strict alliance and amity with others upon these terms we must of course endeavour to silence and suppress our natural and good affections since they are such as woud carry us to the good of society against what we fondly conceive to be our private good and interest as has been shewn now if these selfish passions besides what other ill they are the occasion of are withal the certain means of losing us our natural affections then by what has been provd before tis evident that they must be the certain means of losing us the chief enjoyment of life shaftesbury          and raising in us those horrid and unnatural passions and that savageness of temper which makes the greatest of miserys and the most wretched state of life as remains for us to explain sect   section iii third proof from the unnatural affections the passions therefore which in the last place we are to examine are those which lead neither to a publick nor a private good and are neither of any advantage to the species in general or the creature in particular these in opposition to the social and natural we call the unnatural affections inhumanity of this kind is that unnatural and inhuman delight in beholding torments and in viewing distress calamity blood massacre and destruction with a peculiar joy and pleasure this has been the reigning passion of many tyrants and barbarous nations    and belongs in some degree to such tempers as have thrown off that courteousness of behaviour which retains in us a just reverence of mankind and prevents the growth of harshness and brutality this passion enters not where civility or affable manners have the least place such is the nature of what we call good breeding shaftesbury          that in the midst of many other corruptions it admits not of inhumanity or savage pleasure to see the sufferance of an enemy with cruel delight may proceed from the height of anger revenge fear and other extended selfpassions but to delight in the torture and pain of other creatures indifferently natives or foreigners of our own or of another species kindred or no kindred known or unknown to feed as it were on death and be entertaind with dying agonys this has nothing in it accountable in the way of selfinterest or private good abovementiond but is wholly and absolutely unnatural as it is horrid and miserable petulancy there is another affection nearly related to this which is a gay and frolicksome delight in what is injurious to others a sort of wanton mischievousness and pleasure in what is destructive a passion which instead of being restraind is usually encouragd in children so that tis indeed no wonder if the effects of it are very unfortunately felt in the world for twill be hard perhaps for anyone to give a reason why that temper which was usd to delight in disorder and ravage when in a nursery shoud not afterwards find delight in other disturbances and be the occasion shaftesbury          of equal mischief in familys amongst friends and in the publick itself but of this passion there is not any foundation in nature as has been explaind malignity malice malignity or illwill such as is grounded on no selfconsideration and where there is no subject of anger or jealousy nor any thing to provoke or cause such a desire of doing ill to another this also is of that kind of passion envy envy too when it is such as arises from the prosperity or happiness of another creature no ways interfering with ours is of the same kind of passion moroseness there is also among these a sort of hatred of mankind and    society a passion which has been known perfectly reigning in some men misanthropy  and has had a peculiar name given to it a large share of this belongs to those who have long indulgd themselves in a habitual moroseness or who by force of ill nature and ill breeding have contracted such a reverse of affability and civil manners that to see or meet a stranger is offensive the very aspect of mankind is a disturbance to em and they are sure always to hate at first sight the distemper of this kind is sometimes found to be in a man shaftesbury         ner national but peculiar to the more savage nations inhospitality barbarity  and a plain characteristick of uncivilizd manners and barbarity this is the immediate opposite to that noble affection which in antient language was termd hospitality viz extensive love of mankind and relief of strangers superstition we may add likewise to the number of the unnatural passions all those which are raisd from superstition as beforementiond and from the customs of barbarous countrys all which are too horrid and odious in themselves to need any proof of their being miserable unnatural lusts there might be other passions namd such as unnatural lusts in foreign kinds or species with other perversions of the amorous desire within our own but as to these depravitys of appetite we need add nothing here after what has been already said on the subject of the more natural passions such as these are the only affections or passions we can strictly call unnatural ill and of no tendency so much as to any separate or private good others indeed there are which have this tendency but are so exorbitant and out of measure so shaftesbury          beyond the common bent of any ordinary selfpassion and so utterly contrary and abhorrent to all social and natural affection that they are generally calld and may be justly esteemd unnatural and monstrous tyranny among these may be reckond such an enormous pride or ambition such an arrogance and tyranny as woud willingly leave nothing eminent nothing free nothing prosperous in    the world such an anger as woud sacrifice every thing to itself such a revenge as is never to be extinguishd nor ever satisfyd without the greatest crueltys such an inveteracy and rancour as seeks as it were occasion to exert itself and lays hold of the least subject so as often to make the weight of its malevolence fall even upon such as are mere objects of pity and compassion treachery ingratitude treachery and ingratitude are in strictness mere negative vices and in themselves no real passions having neither aversion or inclination belonging to them but are derivd from the defect unsoundness or corruption of the affections in general but when these vices become remarkable in a character and arise in a manner from inclination and choice when they are so for shaftesbury         ward and active as to appear of their own accord without any pressing occasion tis apparent they borrow something of the mere unnatural passions and are derivd from malice envy and inveteracy as explaind above unnatural pleasure in general it may be objected here that these passions unnatural as they are carry still a sort of pleasure with them and that however barbarous a pleasure it be yet still it is a pleasure and satisfaction which is found in pride or tyranny revenge malice or cruelty exerted now if it be possible in nature that anyone can feel a barbarous or malicious joy otherwise than in consequence of mere anguish and torment then may we perhaps allow this kind of satisfaction to be calld pleasure or delight but the case is evidently contrary to love and to be kind to have social or natural affection complacency and goodwill is to feel immediate satisfaction and genuine content tis in itself original joy depending on no preceding pain or uneasiness and producing nothing beside satisfaction merely on the other side animosity hatred and bitterness is original misery and torment producing no other pleasure or satisfaction than as the unnatural desire is for the instant satisfyd by some shaftesbury         thing which appeases it how strong soever this pleasure therefore may appear it only the more implies the misery of that state which produces it for as the cruellest bodily pains do by    intervals of assuagement produce as has been shewn the highest bodily pleasure so the fiercest and most raging torments of the mind do by certain moments of relief afford the greatest of mental enjoyments to those who know little of the truer kind unnatural state the men of gentlest dispositions and best of tempers have at some time or other been sufficiently acquainted with those disturbances which at ill hours even small occasions are apt to raise from these slender experiences of harshness and illhumour they fully know and will confess the ill moments which are passd when the temper is ever so little galld or fretted how must it fare therefore with those who hardly know any better hours in life and who for the greatest part of it are agitated by a thorow active spleen a close and settled malignity and rancour how lively must be the sense of every thwarting and controuling accident how great must be the shocks of disappointment the stings of affront and the agonys of a working antipathy against the multiplyd objects of offence nor can it be wonderd at if to persons shaftesbury       0  thus agitated and oppressd it seems a high delight to appease and allay for the while those furious and rough motions by an indulgence of their passion in mischief and revenge now as to the consequences of this unnatural state in respect of interest and the common circumstances of life upon what terms a person who has in this manner lost all which we call nature can be supposd to stand in respect of the society of mankind how he feels himself in it what sense he has of his own disposition towards others and of the mutual disposition of others towards himself this is easily conceivd what injoyment or rest is there for one who is not conscious of the merited affection or love but on the contrary of the illwill and hatred of every human soul what ground must this afford for horror and despair what foundation of fear and continual apprehension from mankind and from superior powers how thorow and deep must be that melancholy which being once movd has nothing soft or pleasing from the side of friendship to allay or divert it wherever such a creature turns himself whichever    way he casts his eye every thing around must appear ghastly and horrid shaftesbury          every thing hostile and as it were bent against a private and single being who is thus divided from every thing and at defiance and war with the rest of nature tis thus at last that a mind becomes a wilderness where all is laid waste every thing fair and goodly removd and nothing extant beside what is savage and deformd now if banishment from ones country removal to a foreign place or any thing which looks like solitude or desertion be so heavy to endure what must it be to feel this inward banishment this real estrangement from human commerce and to be after this manner in a desart and in the horridest of solitudes even when in the midst of society what must it be to live in this disagreement with every thing this irreconcilableness and opposition to the order and government of the universe hence it appears that the greatest of miserys accompanys that state which is consequent to the loss of natural affection and that to have those horrid monstrous and unnatural affections is to be miserable in the highest degree shaftesbury         conclusion thus have we endeavourd to prove what was proposd in the beginning and since in the common and known sense of vice and illness noone can be vitious or ill except either     by the deficiency or weakness of natural affections or     by the violence of the selfish or     by such as are plainly unnatural it must follow that if each of these are pernicious and destructive to the creature insomuch that his compleatest state of misery is made from hence to be wicked or vitious is to be miserable and unhappy and since every vitious action must in proportion more or less    help towards this mischief and selfill it must follow conclusion  that every vitious action must be selfinjurious and ill on the other side the happiness and good of virtue has been provd from the contrary effect of other affections shaftesbury          such as are according to nature and the oeconomy of the species or kind we have cast up all those particulars from whence as by way of addition and subtraction the main sum or general account of happiness is either augmented or diminishd and if there be no article exceptionable in this scheme of moral arithmetick the subject treated may be said to have an evidence as great as that which is found in numbers or mathematicks for let us carry scepticism ever so far let us doubt if we can of every thing about us we cannot doubt of what passes within ourselves our passions and affections are known to us they are certain whatever the objects may be on which they are employd nor is it of any concern to our argument how these exterior objects stand whether they are realitys or mere illusions whether we wake or dream for ill dreams will be equally disturbing and a good dream if life be nothing else will be easily and happily passd in this dream of life therefore our demonstrations have the same force our balance and oeconomy hold good and our obligation to virtue is in every respect the same upon the whole there is not i presume the least degree of certainty wanting in what has been said concerning the preferableness of the mental pleasures to the shaftesbury          sensual and even of the sensual accompanyd with good affection and under a temperate and right use to those which are no ways restraind nor supported by any thing social or affectionate nor is there less evidence in what has been said of the united structure and fabrick of the mind and of those passions which constitute the temper or soul and on which its happiness or misery so immediately depend it has been shewn that in this constitution the impairing of any one part must instantly tend to the disorder and ruin of other parts and of the whole itself thro the necessary connexion and balance of the affections that those very passions thro which men are vitious are of themselves a torment  00 and disease and that whatsoever is done which is knowingly ill must be of ill consciousness and in proportion as the act is ill must impair and corrupt social enjoyment and destroy both the capacity of kind affection and the consciousness of meriting any such so that neither can we participate thus in joy or happiness with others or receive satisfaction from the mutual kindness or imagind love of others on which however the greatest of all our pleasures are founded if this be the case of moral delinquency and if the state which is consequent shaftesbury          to this defection from nature be of all other the most horrid oppressive and miserable twill appear that to yield or consent to any thing ill or immoral is a breach of interest and leads to the greatest ills and that on the other side every thing which is an improvement of virtue or an establishment of right affection and integrity is an advancement of interest and leads to the greatest and most solid happiness and enjoyment thus the wisdom of what rules and is first and chief in nature has made it to be according to the private interest and good of everyone to work towards the general good which if a creature ceases to promote he is actually so far wanting to himself and ceases to promote his own happiness and welfare he is on this account directly his own enemy nor can he any otherwise be good or useful to himself than as he continues good to society and to that whole of which he is himself a part so that virtue which of all excellencys and beautys is the chief and most amiable that which is the prop and ornament of human affairs which upholds communitys maintains union friendship and correspondence amongst men that by which countrys as well as private familys flourish and are happy shaftesbury          and for want of which everything comely conspicuous great and worthy must perish and go to ruin that single quality thus beneficial to all society and to mankind in general is found equally a happiness and good to each creature in particular and is that by which alone man can be happy and without which he must be miserable and thus virtue is the good and vice the ill of everyone shaftesbury          0  treatise v viz the moralists a philosophical rhapsody being a recital of certain

section i what mortal if he had never chancd to hear your character palemon coud imagine that a genius fitted for the greatest affairs and formd amidst courts and camps shoud have so violent a turn towards philosophy shaftesbury  0       and the schools who is there coud possibly believe that one of your rank and credit in the fashionable world shoud be so thorowly conversant in the learned one and deeply interested in the affairs of a people so disagreeable to the generality of mankind and humour of the age i believe truly you are the only wellbred man who woud have taken the fancy to talk philosophy in such a circle of good company  0  as we had round us yesterday when we were in your coach together in the park how you coud reconcile the objects there to such subjects as these was unaccountable i coud only conclude that either you had an extravagant passion for philosophy to quit so many charms for it or that some of those tender charms had an extravagant effect which sent you to philosophy for relief in either case i pityd you thinking it a milder fate to be as i truly was for my own part a more indifferent lover twas better i told you to admire beauty and wisdom a little more moderately twas better i maintaind to ingage so cautiously as to be sure of coming off with a whole heart and a fancy as strong as ever towards all the pretty entertainments and diversions of the world for these shaftesbury  0       methought were things one woud not willingly part with for a fine romantick passion of one of those gentlemen whom they calld virtuosos the name i took to belong in common to your lover and philosopher no matter what the object was whether poetry musick philosophy or the fair all who were enamourd anyway were in the same condition you might perceive it i told you by their looks their admiration their profound thoughtfulness their waking ever and anon as out of a dream their talking still of one thing and scarce minding what they said on any other subject—sad indications but all this warning servd not to deter you for you palemon are one of the adventurous whom danger rather animates than discourages and now nothing less will satisfy you than to have our philosophical adventures recorded all must be laid before you and summd in one compleat account to remain it seems as a monument of that unseasonable conversation so opposite to the reigning genius of gallantry and pleasure i must own indeed tis become fashionable in our nation to talk politicks shaftesbury  0       in every company and mix the discourses of stateaffairs with those of pleasure and entertainment however philosophy  tis certain we approve of no such freedom in philosophy nor do  0  we look upon politicks to be of her province or in the least related to her so much have we moderns degraded her and strippd her of her chief rights you must allow me palemon thus to bemoan philosophy since you have forcd me to ingage with her at a time when her credit runs so low she is no longer active in the world nor can hardly with any advantage be brought upon the publick stage we have immurd her poor lady in colleges and cells and have set her servilely to such works as those in the mines empiricks and pedantick sophists are her chief pupils the schoolsyllogism and the elixir are the choicest of her products so far is she from producing statesmen as of old that hardly any man of note in the publick cares to own the least obligation to her if some few maintain their acquaintance and come now and then to her recesses tis as the disciple of quality came to his lord and master secretly and by night morals but as low as philosophy is reducd if morals be allowd belonging to shaftesbury  0       her politicks must undeniably be hers for to understand the manners and constitutions of men in common tis necessary to study man in particular and know the creature as he is in himself before we consider him in company as he is interested in the state or joind to any city or community nothing is more familiar than to reason concerning man in his confederate state and national relation as he stands ingagd to this or that society by birth or naturalization yet to consider him as a citizen or commoner of the world to trace his pedegree a step higher and view his end and constitution in nature itself must pass it seems for some intricate or overrefind speculation it may be properly alledgd perhaps as a reason for this general shyness in moral inquirys that the people to whom it has principally belongd to handle these subjects have done it in such a manner as to put the better sort out of countenance with the undertaking the appropriating this concern to mere scholasticks has brought their fashion and air into the very subject there are formal setplaces where we reckon there is enough said and  0  taught on the head of these graver subjects we can give no quarter to any thing like it in good company the least mention of such matters gives us a disgust shaftesbury  0       and puts us out of humour language  if learning comes across us we count it pedantry if morality tis preaching one must own this however as a real disadvantage of our modern conversations that by such a scrupulous nicety they lose those masculine helps of learning and sound reason even the fair sex in whose favour we pretend to make this condescension may with reason despise us for it and laugh at us for aiming at their peculiar softness tis no compliment to them to affect their manners and be effeminate our sense language and style as well as our voice and person shoud have something of that malefeature and natural roughness by which our sex is distinguishd and whatever politeness we may pretend to tis more a disfigurement than any real refinement of discourse to render it thus delicate style no work of wit can be esteemd perfect without that strength and boldness of hand which gives it body and proportions a good piece the painters say must have good muscling as well as colouring and drapery and surely no writing or discourse of any great moment can seem other than enervated when neither strong reason nor antiquity nor the records of things nor the natural histo shaftesbury  0      ry of man nor anything which can be calld knowledg dares accompany it except perhaps in some ridiculous habit which may give it an air of play and dalliance this brings to my mind a reason i have often sought for why we moderns who abound so much in treatises and essays are so sparing in the way of dialogue dialogue  which heretofore was found the politest and best way of managing even the graver subjects the truth is twoud be an abominable falshood and belying of the age to put so much good sense together in any one conversation as might make it hold out steddily and with plain coherence for an hours time till any one subject had been rationally examind  0  to lay colours to draw or describe against the appearance of nature and truth is a liberty neither permitted the painter nor the poet much less can the philosopher have such a privilege especially in his own case if he represents his philosophy as making any figure in conversation if he triumphs in the debate and gives his own wisdom the advan shaftesbury  0      tage over that of the world he may be liable to sound raillery and possibly be made a fable of a fable tis said of the lion that being in civil conference with the man he wisely refusd to yield the superiority of strength to him when instead of fact the man producd only certain figures and representations of human victorys over the lionkind these masterpieces of art the beast discoverd to be wholly of human forgery and from these he had good right to appeal indeed had he ever in his life been witness to any such combats as the man represented to him in the way of art possibly the example might have movd him but old statues of a hercules a theseus or other beastsubduers coud have little power over him whilst he neither saw nor felt any such living antagonist capable to dispute the field with him we need not wonder therefore that the sort of moral painting by way of dialogue is so much out of fashion and that we see no more of these philosophical portraitures nowadays for where are the originals or what tho you palemon or i by chance have lighted on such a one and pleasd ourselves with the life can you imagine it shoud make a good picture shaftesbury  0      academists you know too that in this academick philosophy i am to present you with there is a certain way of questioning and doubting which noway sutes the genius of our age men love to take party instantly they cant bear being kept in suspence the examination torments em they want to be rid of it upon the easiest terms tis as if men fansyd themselves drowning whenever they dare trust to the current of reason they seem hurrying away they know not whither and are ready to catch at the first twig there they chuse afterwards to hang tho ever so insecurely rather than trust their strength to bear em above water he who has got hold of an  0  hypothesis how slight soever is satisfyd he can presently answer every objection and with a few terms of art give an account of every thing without trouble alchymists tis no wonder if in this age the philosophy of the alchymists prevails so much since it promises such wonders and requires more the labour of hands than brains we have a strange fancy to be creators a violent desire at least to know the knack or secret by which nature does all the rest of our philosophers only aim at that in speculation which our alchymists aspire shaftesbury  0    0  to in practice for with some of these it has been actually under deliberation how to make man by other mediums than nature has hitherto provided every sect has a recipe when you know it you are master of nature you solve all her phaenomena you see all her designs and can account for all her operations if need were you might perchance too be of her laboratory and work for her at least one woud imagine the partizans of each modern sect had this conceit they are all archimedess in their way and can make a world upon easier terms than he offerd to move one dogmatists in short there are good reasons for our being thus superficial and consequently thus dogmatical in philosophy we are too lazy and effeminate and withal a little too cowardly to dare doubt the decisive way best becomes our manners it sutes as well with our vices as with our superstition whichever we are fond of is securd by it if in favour of religion we have espousd an hypothesis on which our faith we think depends we are superstitiously careful not to be loosend in it if by means of our ill morals we are broken with religion tis the same case still we are as much shaftesbury  0       afraid of doubting we must be sure to say it cannot be and tis demonstrable for otherwise who knows and not to know is to yield— thus we will needs know every thing and be at the pains of examining nothing of all philosophy therefore how absolutely the most disagreeable must that appear which goes upon no establishd  0  hypothesis nor presents us with any flattering scheme talks only of probabilitys suspence of judgment inquiry search and caution not to be imposd on or deceivd this is that academick discipline in which formerly the youth were traind antients  when not only horsemanship and military arts had their publick places of exercise but philosophy too had its wrestlers in repute reason and wit had their academy and underwent this trial not in a formal way apart from the world but openly among the better sort and as an exercise of the genteeler kind this the greatest men were not ashamd to practise in the intervals of publick affairs in the highest stations and employments and at the latest hour of their lives hence that way of dialogue and patience of debate and reasoning of which we have scarce a resemblance left in any of our conversations at this season of the world shaftesbury  0      consider then palemon what our picture is like to prove and how it will appear especially in the light you have unluckily chosen to set it for who woud thus have confronted philosophy with the gaiety wit and humour of the age—if this however can be for your credit i am content the project is your own tis you who have matchd philosophy thus unequally therefore leaving you to answer for the success i begin this inauspicious work which my ill stars and you have assignd me and in which i hardly dare ask succour of the muses as poetical as i am obligd to shew myself in this enterprize sect   section ii owretched state of mankind—hapless nature thus to have errd in thy chief workmanship—whence sprang this fatal weakness what chance or destiny shall we accuse or shall we mind the poets when they sing thy tragedy prometheus   0 who with thy stoln celestial fire mixd with vile clay didst mock heavens countenance and in abusive likeness of the immortals shaftesbury  0       madst the compound man that wretched mortal ill to himself and cause of ill to all— what say you palemon to this rant now upon second thoughts or have you forgot twas just in such a romantick strain that you broke out against human kind upon a day when every thing lookd pleasing and the kind itself i thought never appeard fairer or made a better shew but twas not the whole creation you thus quarreld with nor were you so out of conceit with all beauty the verdure of the field the distant prospects the gilded horizon and purple sky formd by a setting sun had charms in abundance and were able to make impression on you here palemon you allowd me to admire as much as i pleasd when at the same instant you woud not bear my talking to you of those nearer beautys of our own kind which i thought more natural for men at our age to admire your severity however coud not silence me upon this subject i continud to plead the cause of the fair and advance their charms above all those other beautys of nature and when you took advantage from this opposition to shew how little there was of nature and how much shaftesbury  0       of art in what i admird i made the best apology i coud and fighting for beauty kept the field as long as there was one fairone present gallantry considering how your genius stood inclind to poetry i wonderd most to find you on a sudden grown so out of conceit with our modern poets and galante writers whom i quoted to you as better authoritys than any antient in behalf of the fair sex and their prerogative but this you treated slightly you acknowledgd it to be true indeed what had been observd by some late wits that gallantry was of a modern growth and well it might be so you thought without dishonour to the antients who understood truth and nature too well to admit so ridiculous an invention twas in vain therefore that i held up this shield in my defense     i did my cause no service when in behalf of the fair i pleaded all the fine things which are usually said in this romantick way to their advantage you attackd the very fortress of gallantry ridiculd the point of honour with all those nice sentiments and ceremonials belonging to it you damnd even our favourite novels those dear sweet natural pieces writ most of em by the fair sex themselves in short this shaftesbury  0       whole order and scheme of wit you condemnd absolutely as false monstrous and gothick quite out of the way of nature and sprung from the mere dregs of chivalry or knighterrantry a thing which in itself you preferd as of a better taste than that which reigns at present in its stead for at a time when this mystery of gallantry carryd along with it the notion of doughty knighthood when the fair were made witnesses and in a manner partys to feats of arms enterd into all the points of war and combat and were won by dint of launce and manly prowess twas not altogether absurd you thought on such a foundation as this to pay em homage and adoration make em the standard of wit and manners and bring mankind under their laws but in a country where no shesaints were worshipd by any authority from religion twas as impertinent and sensless as it was profane to deify the sex raise em to a capacity above what nature had allowd and treat em with a respect which in the natural way of love they themselves were the aptest to complain of indeed as for the moral part twas wonderful you said to observe the licentiousness which this foppish courtly humour had establishd in the world what such a flattering way of address to all the shaftesbury  0       sex in common coud mean you knew not unless it were to render em wholly common indeed and make each fairone apprehend that the publick had a right to her and that beauty was too communicative and divine a thing to be made a property and confind to one at once mean while our company began to leave us the beaumonde whom you had been thus severely censuring drew off apace for     it grew late i took notice that the approaching objects of the night were the more agreeable to you for the solitude they introducd and that the moon and planets which began now to appear were in reality the only proper company for a man in your humour for now you began to talk with much satisfaction of natural things and of all orders of beautys man only excepted never did i hear a finer description than you made of the order of the heavenly luminarys the circles of the planets and their attendent satellites and you who woud allow nothing to those fair earthly luminarys in the circles which just now we movd in you palemon who seemd to overlook the pride of that theater began now to look out with ravishment on this other and triumph in the new philosophical scene of worlds un shaftesbury  0      known here when you had pretty well spent the first fire of your imagination i woud have got you to reason more calmly with me upon that other part of the creation your own kind to which i told you you discoverd so much aversion misanthropy  as woud make one believe you a compleat timon or manhater can you then o philocles said you in a high strain and with a moving air of passion can you believe me of that character or can you think it of me in earnest that being man and conscious of my nature i shoud have yet so little of humanity as not to feel the affections of a man or feeling what is natural towards my kind that i shoud hold their interest light and be indifferently affected with what affects or seriously concerns them am i so ill a lover of my country or is it that you find me indeed so ill a friend for what are all relations else what are the ties of private friendship if that to mankind be not obliging can there be yet a bond in nature if that be none o philocles believe me when i say i feel it one and fully prove its power within me think not that i woud willingly break my chain nor count me so degenerate or unnatural as whilst i hold this form and shaftesbury  0       wear a human heart i shoud throw off love compassion kindness and not befriend mankind—but o what treacherys what disorders and how corrupt is all—did you not observe een now     when all this space was filld with goodly rows of company how peaceful all appeard—what charms there are in publick companys what harmony in courts and courtly places how pleasd is every face how courteous and humane the general carriage and behaviour—what creature capable of reflection if he thus saw us mankind and saw no more woud not believe our earth a very heaven what foreigner the inhabitant suppose of some near planet when he had traveld hither and surveyd this outward face of things woud think of what lay hid beneath the mask—but let him stay awhile allow him leisure till he has gaind a nearer view and following our dissolvd assemblys to their particular recesses he has the power of seeing em in this new aspect—here he may behold those great men of the ministry who not an hour ago in publick appeard such friends now plotting craftily each others ruin with the ruin of the state itself a sacrifice to their ambition here he may see too those of a softer shaftesbury  0       kind who knowing not ambition follow only love yet philocles who woud think it— at these words you may remember i discoverd the lightness of my temper and laughd aloud which i coud hardly hope you woud have pardond had i not freely told you the true reason twas not for want of being affected with what you spoke i only imagind a more particular cause had provokd you when having passd over the ambitious you were coming fullchargd against the people of a softer passion at first i lookd on you as deeply in the spleen but now i concluded you in love and so unhappily engagd as to have reason to complain of infidelity this thought i has movd palemon thus hence the sad world here was that corruption and those disorders he lamented cause of ill after i had beggd pardon for my rude mirth which had the good fortune however to make some change in your humour we fell naturally into cool reasoning about the nature and cause of ill in general thro what contingency what chance by what fatal necessity what will or what permission it came upon the     world or being come shaftesbury  0   00  once shoud still subsist this inquiry which with slight reasoners is easily got over stuck hard i found with one of your close judgment and penetration and this insensibly led us into a nice criticism of nature whom you sharply arraignd for many absurditys you thought her guilty of in relation to mankind and his peculiar state fain woud i have persuaded you to think with more equality of nature and to proportion her defects a little better my notion was that the grievance lay not altogether in one part as you placd it but that every thing had its share of inconvenience pleasure and pain beauty and deformity good and ill seemd to me everywhere interwoven and one with another made i thought a pretty mixture agreeable enough in the main twas the same i fansyd as in some of those rich stuffs where the flowers and ground were oddly put together with such irregular work and contrary colours as lookd ill in the pattern but mighty natural and well in the piece but you were still upon extremes nothing woud serve to excuse the faults shaftesbury  0   0   or blemishes of this part of the creation mankind even tho all besides were fair without a blemish the very storms and tempests had their beauty in your account those alone excepted which arose in human breasts twas only for this turbulent race of mortals you offerd to accuse nature and i now found why you had been so transported with the story of prometheus you wanted such an operator as this for mankind and you were tempted to wish the story coud have been confirmd in modern divinity that clearing the supreme powers of any concern or hand in the ill workmanship you might have the liberty of inveighing against it without profaneness this however i told you was but a slight evasion of the religious poets among the antients twas easy to answer every objection by a prometheus as why had mankind originally so much folly and perverseness why so much pride such ambition     and strange appetites why so many plagues and curses entaild on him and his posterity—prometheus was the cause the plastick artist with his unlucky hand solvd all  twas his contrivance they said and he was to answer for it they reckond it a fair game if they coud gain a single shaftesbury  0   0   remove and put the evil cause farther off if the people askd a question they told em a tale and sent em away satisfyd none besides a few philosophers woud be such busybodys they thought as to look beyond or ask a second question and in reality continud i tis not to be imagind how serviceable a tale is to amuse others besides mere children and how much easier the generality of men are paid in this papercoin than in sterling reason we ought not to laugh so readily at the indian philosophers who to satisfy their people how this huge frame of the world is supported tell em tis by an elephant—and the elephant how—a shreud question but which by no means shoud be answerd tis here only that our indian philosophers are to blame they shoud be contented with the elephant and go no further but they have a tortoise in reverse whose back they think is broad enough so the tortoise must bear the new load and thus the matter stands worse than before the heathen story of prometheus was i told you much the same with this indian one only the heathen mythologists were so wise as not to go beyond the first remove a single pro shaftesbury  0   0  metheus was enough to take the weight from jove they fairly made jove a standerby he resolvd it seems to be neuter and see what woud come of this notable experiment how the dangerous manmoulder woud proceed and what woud be the event of his tampering—excellent account to satisfy the heathen vulgar but how think you woud a philosopher digest this for the gods he woud say presently either coud have hinderd prometheuss creation or they coud not if they coud they were answerable for the consequences if they coud not they were no longer gods being thus limited and contrould and whether prometheus were a name for chance destiny a plastick nature or an evil daemon     whatever was designd by it twas still the same breach of omnipotence that such a hazardous affair as this of creation shoud have been undertaken by those who had not perfect foresight as well as command you ownd was neither wise nor just but you stood to foresight you allowd the consequences to have been understood by the creating powers when they undertook their work and you denyd that it woud have been better for them to have omitted it tho they knew shaftesbury  0   0   what woud be the event  twas better still that the project shoud be executed whatever might become of mankind or how hard soever such a creation was like to fall on the generality of this miserable race for twas impossible you thought that heaven shoud have acted otherwise than for the best so that even from this misery and ill of man there was undoubtedly some good arising something which overbalancd all and made full amends this was a confession i wonderd indeed how i came to draw from you and soon afterwards i found you somewhat uneasy under it for here i took up your own part against you and setting all those villanys and corruptions of human kind in the same light you had done just before i put it upon you to tell where possibly coud be the advantage or good arising hence or what excellence or beauty coud redound from those tragical pictures you yourself had drawn so well after the life whether it must not be a very strong philosophical faith which shoud persuade one that those dismal parts you set to view were only the necessary shades of a fine piece to be reckond among the beautys of the crea shaftesbury  0   0  tion or whether possibly you might look upon that maxim as very fit for heaven which i was sure you did not approve at all in mankind to do ill that good might follow this i said made me think of the manner of our modern prometheuss the mountebanks who performd such wonders of many kinds here on our earthly stages they coud create diseases and make mischief in order to heal and to restore but shoud we     assign such a practice as this to heaven shoud we dare to make such empiricks of the gods and such a patient of poor nature was this a reason for natures sickliness or how else came she poor innocent to fall sick or run astray had she been originally healthy or created sound at first she had still continud so twas no credit to the gods to leave her destitute or with a flaw which woud cost dear the mending and make them sufferers for their own work— i was going to bring homer to witness for the many troubles of jove the death of sarpedon and the frequent crosses heaven met with from the fatal sisters but this discourse i saw displeasd you scepticism  i had by this time plainly discoverd my inclination to scep shaftesbury  0   0  ticism and here not only religion was objected to me but i was reproachd too on the account of that gallantry which i had some time before defended both were joind together in the charge you made against me when you saw i adherd to nothing but was now as ready to declaim against the fair as i had been before to plead their cause and defend the moral of lovers this you said was my constant way in all debates i was as well pleasd with the reason on one side as on the other i never troubled myself about the success of the argument but laughd still whatever way it went and even when i convincd others never seemd as if i was convincd myself i ownd to you palemon there was truth enough in your charge for above all things i lovd ease and of all philosophers those who reasond most at their ease and were never angry or disturbd as those calld scepticks you ownd never were i lookd upon this kind of philosophy as the prettiest agreeablest roving exercise of the mind possible to be imagind the other kind i thought was painful and laborious to keep always in the limits of one path to drive always at a point and hold precisely to what men at a venture calld shaftesbury  0   0   the truth a point in all appearance very unfixd and hard to ascertain besides my way hurt no body i was always the first to comply on any occasion and for matters of religion was further from profaneness and erroneous doctrine     than anyone i coud never have the sufficiency to shock my spiritual and learned superiors i was the furthest from leaning to my own understanding nor was i one who exalted reason above faith or insisted much upon what the dogmatical men call demonstration and dare oppose to the sacred mysterys of religion and to shew you continud i how impossible it is for the men of our sort ever to err from the catholick and establishd faith pray consider that whereas others pretend to see with their own eyes what is properest and best for them in religion we for our parts pretend not to see with any other than those of our spiritual guides neither do we presume to judg those guides ourselves but submit to them as they are appointed us by our just superiors in short you who are rationalists and walk by reason in every thing pretend to know all things whilst you believe little or nothing we for our parts know nothing and believe all shaftesbury  0   0  here i ended and in return you only askd me coldly whether with that fine scepticism of mine i made no more distinction between sincerity and insincerity in actions than i did between truth and falshood right and wrong in arguments i durst not ask what your question drove at i was afraid i saw it too plainly and that by this loose way of talking which i had learnt in some fashionable conversations of the world i had given you occasion to suspect me of the worst sort of scepticism such as spard nothing but overthrew all principles moral and divine forgive me said i good palemon you are offended i see and not without cause but what if i shoud endeavour to compensate my sceptical misbehaviour by using a known sceptick privilege and asserting strenuously the cause i have hitherto opposd do not imagine that i dare aspire so high as to defend reveald religion or the holy mysterys of the christian faith i am unworthy of such a task and shoud profane the subject tis of mere philosophy i speak and my fancy is only to try what i can shaftesbury  0   0   muster up thence to make head against the chief arguments of atheism and reestablish what i have offerd to loosen in the system of theism deism your project said you bids fair to reconcile me to your character     which i was beginning to mistrust for as averse as i am to the cause of theism or name of deist when taken in a sense exclusive of revelation i consider still that in strictness the root of all is theism and that to be a settled christian it is necessary to be first of all a good theist for theism can only be opposd to polytheism or atheism nor have i patience to hear the name of deist the highest of all names decryd and set in opposition to christianity as if our religion was a kind of magick which depended not on the belief of a single supreme being or as if the firm and rational belief of such a being on philosophical grounds was an improper qualification for believing any thing further excellent presumption for those who naturally incline to the disbelief of revelation or who thro vanity affect a freedom of this kind— but let me hear continud you whether in good earnest and thorow sinceri shaftesbury  0    0 ty you intend to advance any thing in favour of that opinion which is fundamental to all religion or whether you design only to divert yourself with the subject as you have done hitherto whatever your thoughts are philocles i am resolvd to force em from you you can no longer plead the unsutableness of the time or place to such grave subjects the gaudy scene is over with the day our company have long since quitted the field and the solemn majesty of such a night as this may justly sute with the profoundest meditation or most serious discourse thus palemon you continud to urge me till by necessity i was drawn into the following vein of philosophical enthusiasm sect   section iii you shall find then said i taking a grave air that it is possible for me to be serious and that tis probable i am growing so for good and all your overseriousness awhile since at such an unseasonable time may have driven me perhaps into a contrary extreme by opposition to your melancholy humour but i   0 have now a better idea of that melan shaftesbury  0      choly you discoverd and notwithstanding the humorous turn you were pleasd to give it i am persuaded it has a different foundation from any of those fantastical causes i then assignd to it love love  doubtless is at the bottom but a nobler love than such as common beautys inspire— here in my turn i began to raise my voice and imitate the solemn way you had been teaching me knowing as you are continud i wellknowing and experiencd in all the degrees and orders of beauty beauty  in all the mysterious charms of the particular forms you rise to what is more general and with a larger heart and mind more comprehensive you generously seek that which is highest in the kind not captivated by the lineaments of a fair face or the welldrawn proportions of a human body you view the life itself and embrace rather the mind which adds the lustre and renders chiefly amiable society nor is the enjoyment of such a single beauty sufficient to satisfy such an aspiring soul it seeks how to combine more beautys and by what coalition of these to form a beautiful society it views communitys friendships re shaftesbury  0      lations dutys and considers by what harmony of particular minds the general harmony is composd and commonweal establishd nor satisfyd even with publick good in one community of men it frames itself a nobler object virtue  and with enlargd affection seeks the good of mankind it dwells with pleasure amidst that reason and those orders on which this fair correspondence and goodly interest is establishd laws constitutions civil and religious rites whatever civilizes or polishes rude mankind the sciences and arts philosophy morals virtue the flourishing state of human affairs and the perfection of human nature these are its delightful prospects and this the charm of beauty which attracts it universe still ardent in this pursuit such is its love of order and perfection it rests not here nor satisfies itself with the beauty of a part but extending further its communicative bounty seeks the good of all and affects the interest and prosperity of the whole true to     its native world and higher country tis here it seeks order and perfection wishing the best and hoping still to find a just and wise administration shaftesbury  0      and since all hope of this were vain and idle if no universal mind presided god  since without such a supreme intelligence and providential care the distracted universe must be condemnd to suffer infinite calamitys tis here the generous mind labours to discover that healing cause by which the interest of the whole is securely establishd the beauty of things and the universal order happily sustaind ill natural and moral this palemon is the labour of your soul and this its melancholy when unsuccessfully pursuing the supreme beauty it meets with darkning clouds which intercept its sight monsters arise not those from lybian desarts but from the heart of man more fertile and with their horrid aspect cast an unseemly reflection upon nature she helpless as she is thought and working thus absurdly is contemnd the government of the world arraignd and deity made void much is alledgd in answer to shew why nature errs and how she came thus impotent and erring from an unerring hand but i deny she errs and when she seems most ignorant or shaftesbury  0       perverse in her productions i assert her even then as wise and provident as in her goodliest works for tis not then that men complain of the worlds order or abhor the face of things when they see various interests mixd and interfering natures subordinate of different kinds opposd one to another and in their different operations submitted the higher to the lower tis on the contrary from this order of inferior and superior things that we admire the worlds beauty founded thus on contrarietys whilst from such various and disagreeing principles a universal concord is establishd thus in the several orders of terrestrial forms a resignation is requird a sacrifice and mutual yielding of natures one to another     the vegetables by their death sustain the animals and animal bodys dissolvd enrich the earth and raise again the vegetable world the numerous insects are reducd by the superior kinds of birds and beasts and these again are checkd by man who in his turn submits to other natures and resigns his form a sacrifice in common to the rest of things shaftesbury  0       and if in natures so little exalted or preeminent above each other the sacrifice of interests can appear so just how much more reasonably may all inferior natures be subjected to the superior nature of the world that world palemon which even now transported you when the suns fainting light gave way to these bright constellations and left you this wide system to contemplate here are those laws which ought not nor can submit to any thing below the central powers which hold the lasting orbs in their just poize and movement must not be contrould to save a fleeting form and rescue from the precipice a puny animal whose brittle frame howeer protected must of itself so soon dissolve the ambient air the inward vapours the impending meteors or whatever else is nutrimental or preservative of this earth must operate in a natural course and other constitutions must submit to the good habit and constitution of the allsustaining globe let us not therefore wonder if by earthquakes storms pestilential blasts nether or upper fires or floods the animal kinds are oft afflicted and whole shaftesbury  0       species perhaps involvd at once in common ruin but much less let us account it strange if either by outward shock or some interior wound from hostile matter particular animals are deformd even in their first conception when the disease invades the seats of generation and seminal parts are injurd and obstructed in their accurate labours tis then alone that monstrous shapes are seen nature still working as before and not perversly or erroneously not faintly or with feeble endeavours but oerpowerd by a superior rival and by another natures justly conquering force nor need we wonder if the interior form the soul and temper partakes of this occasional deformity and sympathizes often with     its close partner who is there can wonder either at the sicknesses of sense or the depravity of minds inclosd in such frail bodys and dependent on such pervertible organs good here then is that solution you require and hence those seeming blemishes cast upon nature nor is there ought in this beside what is natural and good tis good which is predominant and every corruptible and mortal nature by its mortality and corruption yields only to some better and all in shaftesbury  0       common to that best and highest nature which is incorruptible and immortal i scarce had ended these words ere you broke out in admiration asking what had befalln me that of a sudden i had thus changd my character and enterd into thoughts which must certainly you supposd have some foundation in me since i coud express them with such seeming affection as i had done o said i palemon that it had been my fortune to have met you the other day just at my return out of the country from a friend whose conversation had in one day or two made such an impression on me that i shoud have suted you to a miracle you woud have thought indeed that i had been curd of my scepticism and levity so as never to have rallyd more at that wild rate on any subject much less on these which are so serious truly said you i coud wish i had met you rather at that time or that those good and serious impressions of your friend had without interruption lasted with you till this moment whatever they were i told you palemon i had not so lost em neither shaftesbury  0       as not easily you saw to revive em on occasion were i not afraid afraid said you for whose sake good philocles i intreat you for mine or your own for both replyd i for tho i was like to be perfectly curd of my scepticism twas by what i thought worse enthusiast  downright enthusiasm you never knew a more agreeable enthusiast were he my friend said you i shoud hardly treat him in so free a manner nor shoud i perhaps judg that to be enthusiasm which you so freely term so i have a strong suspicion that you injure     him nor can i be satisfyd till i hear further of that serious conversation for which you tax him as enthusiastick i must confess said i he had nothing of that savage air of the vulgar enthusiastick kind all was serene soft and harmonious the manner of it was more after the pleasing transports of those antient poets you are often charmd with than after the fierce unsociable way of modern zealots those starchd gruff gentlemen who guard religion as bullys do a mistress and give us the while a very indifferent opinion of their ladys merit and their own wit by adoring what they neither allow to be inspected by others nor care themselves to examine in a fair shaftesbury  0       light but here ill answer for it there was nothing of disguise or paint all was fair open and genuine as nature herself twas nature he was in love with twas nature he sung and if anyone might be said to have a natural mistress my friend certainly might whose heart was thus ingagd but love i found was everywhere the same and tho the object here was very fine and the passion it created very noble yet liberty i thought was finer than all and i who never card to ingage in other loves of the least continuance was the more afraid i told you of this which had such a power with my poor friend as to make him appear the perfectest enthusiast in the world illhumour only excepted for this was singular in him that tho he had all of the enthusiast he had nothing of the bigot he heard every thing with mildness and delight and bore with me when i treated all his thoughts as visionary and when scepticklike i unraveld all his systems here was that character and description which so highly pleasd you that you woud hardly suffer me to come to a conclusion twas impossible i found to give you satisfaction without reciting the main of what passd in those two days between my friend and me in our country shaftesbury  0    0 retirement again and again i bid you beware you knew not the danger of this philosophical passion nor considerd what you might possibly draw upon yourself and make me the author of i was far enough engagd already and you were pushing me further at your own hazard     all i coud say made not the least impression on you but rather than proceed any further this night i engagd for your sake to turn writer and draw up the memoirs of those two philosophical days beginning with what had passd this last day between ourselves as i have accordingly done you see by way of introduction to my story by this time being got late to town some hours after the latest of our company you set me down at my own lodging and thus we bad goodnight shaftesbury  0      part ii philocles to palemon sect   section i after such a day as yesterday i might well have thought it hard when i awakd the next morning to find myself under positive engagements of proceeding in the same philosophical way without intermission and upon harder terms than ever for twas no longer the agreeable part of a companion which i had now to bear your conversation palemon which had hitherto supported me was at an end i was now alone confind to my closet obligd to meditate by myself and reducd to the hard circumstances of an author and historian in the most difficult subject but here methought propitious heaven in some manner assisted me for if dreams were as homer teaches sent shaftesbury  0       from the throne of jove i might conclude i had a favourable one of the true sort towards the morninglight which as i recollected myself gave me a clear and perfect idea of what i desird so earnestly to bring back to my memory i found myself transported to a distant country which presented     a pompous rural scene it was a mountain not far from the sea its brow adornd with antient wood and at its foot a river and wellinhabited plain beyond which the sea appearing closd the prospect no sooner had i considerd the place than i discernd it to be the very same where i had talkd with theocles the second day i was with him in the country i lookd about to see if i coud find my friend and calling theocles i awakd but so powerful was the impression of my dream and so perfect the idea raisd in me of the person words and manner of my friend that i coud now fansy myself philosophically inspird as that roman sage by his aegeria and invited on this occasion to try my historical muse for justly might i hope for such assistance in behalf of theocles who so lovd the muses and was i thought no less belovd by them shaftesbury  0      to return therefore to that original rural scene and that heroick genius the companion and guide of my first thoughts in these profounder subjects i found him the first morning with his belovd mantuan muse roving in the fields where as i had been informd at his house he was gone out after his usual way to read the moment he saw me his book vanishd and he came with friendly haste to meet me after we had embracd i discoverd my curiosity to know what he was reading and askd if it were of a secret kind to which i coud not be admitted on this he shewd me his poet and looking pleasantly now tell me truly said he philocles did you not expect some more mysterious book than this i ownd i did considering his character which i took to be of so contemplative a kind and do you think said he that without being contemplative one can truly relish these diviner poets indeed said i i never thought there was any need of growing contemplative or retiring from the world to read virgil or horace retirement you have namd two said he who can hardly be thought so very like tho shaftesbury  0       they were friends and equally good poets yet joining em     as you are pleasd to do i woud willingly learn from you whether in your opinion there be any disposition so fitted for reading em as that in which they writ themselves in this i am sure they both joind heartily to love retirement when for the sake of such a life and habit as you call contemplative they were willing to sacrifice the highest advantages pleasures and favour of a court but i will venture to say more in favour of retirement that not only the best authors but the best company require this seasoning society itself cannot be rightly enjoyd without some abstinence and separate thought all grows insipid dull and tiresom without the help of some intervals of retirement say philocles whether you yourself have not often found it so do you think those lovers understand the interests of their loves who by their goodwill woud never be parted for a moment or woud they be discreet friends think you who woud chuse to live together on such terms what relish then must the world have that common world of mixd and undistinguishd company without a little solitude without stepping now and then aside out of the road and beaten track of life that tedious circle of noise and show which forces wea shaftesbury  0      ryd mankind to seek relief from every poor diversion by your rule said i theocles there shoud be no such thing as happiness or good in life since every enjoyment wears out so soon and growing painful is diverted by some other thing and that again by some other and so on i am sure if solitude serves as a remedy or diversion to any thing in the world there is nothing which may not serve as diversion to solitude which wants it more than any thing besides and thus there can be no good which is regular or constant happiness is a thing out of the way and only to be found in wandring o philocles replyd he happiness good  i rejoice to find you in the pursuit of happiness and good however you may wander nay tho you doubt whether there be that thing yet if you reason tis sufficient there is hope still but see how you have unawares engagd yourself for if you have destroyd all good because in all you can think     of there is nothing will constantly hold so then you have set it as a maxim and very justly in my opinion that nothing can be good but what is constant i own said i that all i know of worldly satisfaction is inconstant the shaftesbury  0       things which give it are never at a stay and the good itself whatever it be depends no less on humour than on fortune for that which chance may often spare time will not age change of temper other thoughts a different passion new engagements a new turn of life or conversation the least of these are fatal and alone sufficient to destroy enjoyment tho the object be the same the relish changes and the shortlivd good expires but i shoud wonder much if you coud tell me any thing in life which was not of as changeable a nature and subject to the same common fate of satiety and disgust pleasure i find then replyd he that the current notion of good is not sufficient to satisfy you you can afford to scepticize where noone else will so much as hesitate for almost everyone philosophizes dogmatically on this head all are positive in this that our real good is pleasure if they woud inform us which said i or what sort and ascertain once the very species and distinct kind such as must constantly remain the same and equally eligible at all times i shoud then perhaps be better satisfyd but when will and pleasure are synonymous when every shaftesbury  0       thing which pleases us is calld pleasure and we never chuse or prefer but as we please tis trifling to say pleasure is our good for this has as little meaning as to say we chuse what we think eligible and we are pleasd with what delights or pleases us the question is whether we are rightly pleasd and chuse as we shoud do for as highly pleasd as children are with baubles or with whatever affects their tender senses we cannot in our hearts sincerely admire their enjoyment or imagine em possessors of any extraordinary good yet are their senses we     know as keen and susceptible of pleasure as our own the same reflection is of force as to mere animals who in respect of the liveliness and delicacy of sensation have many of em the advantage of us and as for some low and sordid pleasures of human kind shoud they be ever so lastingly enjoyd and in the highest credit with their enjoyers i shoud never afford em the name of happiness or good woud you then appeal said he from the immediate feeling and experience of one who is pleasd and satisfyd with what he enjoys shaftesbury  0      most certainly i shoud appeal said i continuing the same zeal which theocles had stirrd in me against those dogmatizers on pleasure for is there that sordid creature on earth who does not prize his own enjoyment does not the frowardest the most rancorous distemperd creature do as much is not malice and cruelty of the highest relish with some natures is not a hoggish life the height of some mens wishes you woud not ask me surely to enumerate the several species of sensations which men of certain tastes have adopted and ownd for their chief pleasure and delight for with some men even diseases have been thought valuable and worth the cherishing merely for the pleasure found in allaying the ardor of an irritating sensation and to these absurd epicures those other are near akin who by studyd provocatives raise unnatural thirst and appetite and to make way for fresh repletion prepare emeticks as the last desert the sooner to renew the feast tis said i know proverbially that tastes are different and must not be disputed and i remember some such motto as this placd once on a devise which was found sutable to the notion a fly was represented feeding on a certain lump the food however vile was natural to the animal there was no ab shaftesbury  0      surdity in the case but shoud you shew me a brutish or a barbarous man thus taken up and solacd in his pleasure shoud you shew me a sot in his solitary debauch or a tyrant in the exercise of his cruelty with this motto over him to forbid my appeal i shoud hardly be brought to think the better of his enjoyment nor   0 can i possibly suppose that a mere sordid wretch with a base abject soul and the best fortune in the world was ever capable of any real enjoyment by this zeal replyd theocles which you have shewn in the refuting a wrong hypothesis one woud imagine you had in reality some notion of a right and began to think that there might possibly be such a thing at last as good that there is something nearer to good and more like it than another i am free said i to own but what real good is i am still to seek and must therefore wait till you can better inform me this i only know that either all pleasure is good or only some if all then every kind of sensuality must be precious and desirable if some only then we are to seek what kind and discover if we can what it is which distinguishes between one pleasure and another and makes one indifferent sorry mean shaftesbury  0    0  another valuable and worthy and by this stamp this character if there be any such we must define good and not by pleasure itself which may be very great and yet very contemptible nor can anyone truly judg the value of any immediate sensation otherwise than by judging first of the situation of his own mind for that which we esteem a happiness in one situation of mind is otherwise thought of in another which situation therefore is the justest must be considerd how to gain that point of sight whence probably we may best discern and how to place ourselves in that unbiassd state in which we are fittest to pronounce o philocles replyd he if this be unfeignedly your sentiment if it be possible you shoud have the fortitude to withhold your assent in this affair and go in search of what the meanest of mankind think they already know so certainly tis from a nobler turn of thought than what you have observd in any of the modern scepticks you have conversd with for if i mistake not there are hardly anywhere at this day a sort of people more peremptory or who deliberate less on the shaftesbury  0       choice of good they who pretend     to such a scrutiny of other evidences are the readiest to take the evidence of the greatest deceivers in the world their own passions having gaind as they think a liberty from some seeming constraints of religion they suppose they employ this liberty to perfection by following the first motion of their will and assenting to the first dictate or report of any prepossessing fancy any foremost opinion or conceit of good so that their privilege is only that of being perpetually amusd and their liberty that of being imposd on in their most important choice i think one may say with assurance that the greatest of fools is he who imposes on himself and in his greatest concern thinks certainly he knows that which he has least studyd and of which he is most profoundly ignorant he who is ignorant but knows his ignorance is far wiser and to do justice to these fashionable men of wit they are not all of em indeed so insensible as not to perceive something of their own blindness and absurdity for often when they seriously reflect on their past pursuits and engagements they freely own that for what remains of life they know not whether they shall be of apiece with them shaftesbury  0      selves or whether their fancy humour or passion will not hereafter lead em to a quite different choice in pleasure and to a disapprobation of all they ever enjoyd before—comfortable reflection to bring the satisfactions of the mind continud he and the enjoyments of reason and judgment under the denomination of pleasure is only a collusion and a plain receding from the common notion of the word they deal not fairly with us who in their philosophical hour admit that for pleasure which at an ordinary time and in the common practice of life is so little taken for such the mathematician who labours at his problem the bookish man who toils the artist who endures voluntarily the greatest hardships and fatigues none of these are said to follow pleasure nor will the men of pleasure by any means admit em to be of their number the satisfactions which are purely mental and depend     only on the motion of a thought must in all likelihood be too refind for the apprehensions of our modern epicures who are so taken up with pleasure of a more substantial kind they who are full of the idea of such a sensible solid good can have but a slender fancy for the mere spiritual and intellectual sort but tis this latter they set up and shaftesbury  0       magnify upon occasion to save the ignominy which may redound to em from the former this done the latter may take its chance its use is presently at an end for tis observable that when the men of this sort have recommended the enjoyments of the mind under the title of pleasure when they have thus dignifyd the word and included in it whatever is mentally good or excellent they can afterwards suffer it contentedly to slide down again into its own genuine and vulgar sense whence they raisd it only to serve a turn when pleasure is calld in question and attackd then reason and virtue are calld in to her aid and made principal parts of her constitution a complicated form appears and comprehends straight all which is generous honest and beautiful in human life but when the attack is over and the objection once solvd the specter vanishes pleasure returns again to her former shape she may een be pleasure still and have as little concern with dry sober reason as in the nature of the thing and according to common understanding she really has for if this rational sort of enjoyment be admitted into the notion of good how is it possible to admit withal that kind of sensation which in effect is rather opposite to this enjoyment tis certain that in respect of the mind and its enjoyments shaftesbury  0       the eagerness and irritation of mere pleasure pleasure and pain  is as disturbing as the importunity and vexation of pain if either throws the mind off its biass and deprives it of the satisfaction it takes in its natural exercise and employment the mind in this case must be sufferer as well by one as by the other if neither does this there is no harm on either side— by the way said i interrupting him as sincere as i am in questioning whether pleasure be really good i am not such a sceptick as to doubt whether pain be really ill whatever is grievous replyd he can be no other than ill but     that what is grievous to one is not so much as troublesom to another let sportsmen soldiers and others of the hardy kinds be witness nay that what is pain to one is pleasure to another and so alternately we very well know since men vary in their apprehension of these sensations and on many occasions confound one with the other has not even nature herself in some respects as it were blended em together and as a wise man said once joind the extremity of one so nicely to the other that it absolutely runs into it and is undistinguishable shaftesbury  0      in fine then said i if pleasure and pain be thus convertible and mixd if according to your account that which is now pleasure by being straind a little too far runs into pain and pain when carryd far creates again the highest pleasure by mere cessation and a kind of natural succession if some pleasures to some are pains and some pains to others are pleasures all this if i mistake not makes still for my opinion and shows that there is nothing you can assign which can really stand as good good  for if pleasure be not good nothing is and if pain be ill as i must necessarily take for granted we have a shreud chance on the ill side indeed but none at all on the better so that we may fairly doubt whether life itself be not mere misery since gainers by it we can never be losers we may sufficiently and are like to be every hour of our lives accordingly what our english poetess says of good shoud be just and proper  tis good not to be born—and thus for any thing of good which can be expected in life we may een beg pardon of nature and return her present on her hands without waiting for her call shaftesbury  0       for what shoud hinder us or what are we the better for living the query said he is pertinent but why such dispatch if the case be doubtful this surely my good philocles is a plain transgression of your sceptical bounds we must be sufficiently dogmatical to come to this determination futurity  tis a deciding as well concerning death as life what possibly may be hereafter and what not now to be assurd that we can never be concernd in     any thing hereafter we must understand perfectly what it is which concerns or engages us in any thing present we must truly know ourselves self  and in what this self of ours consists we must determine against preexistence and give a better reason for our having never been concernd in ought before our birth than merely because we remember not nor are conscious for in many things we have been concernd to purpose of which we have now no memory or consciousness remaining and thus we may happen to be again and again to perpetuity for any reason we can show to the contrary all is revolution in us we are no more the selfsame matter or system of matter from one day to another what succession there may be here shaftesbury  0      after we know not since even now we live by succession and only perish and are renewd tis in vain we flatter ourselves with the assurance of our interests ending with a certain shape or form what interested us at first in it we know not any more than how we have since held on and continue still concernd in such an assemblage of fleeting particles where besides or in what else we may have to do futurity  perchance in time to come we know as little nor can tell how chance or providence hereafter may dispose of us and if providence be in the case we have still more reason to consider how we undertake to be our own disposers it must needs become a sceptick above all men to hesitate in matters of exchange and tho he acknowledges no present good or enjoyment in life he must be sure however of bettering his condition before he attempts to alter it but as yet philocles even this point remains undetermind between us good  whether in this present life there be not such a thing as real good be you therefore said i my instructor sagacious theocles and inform me what that good is or where which can afford contentment and satisfaction always alike without varia shaftesbury  0      tion or diminution for tho on some occasions and in some subjects the mind may possibly be so bent and the passion so wrought up that for the time no bodily sufferance or pain can alter it yet this is what can seldom happen and is unlikely to last long since without     any pain or inconvenience the passion in a little time does its own work the mind relaxes with its bent and the temper wearyd with repetition finds no more enjoyment but runs to something new hear then said theocles for tho i pretend not to tell you at once the nature of this which i call good yet i am content to shew you something of it in yourself which you will acknowledg to be naturally more fixd and constant than any thing you have hitherto thought on tell me my friend if ever you were weary of doing good to those you lovd friendship  say when you ever found it unpleasing to serve a friend or whether when you first provd this generous pleasure you did not feel it less than at this present after so long experience believe me philocles this pleasure is more debauching than any other never did any soul do good but it came readier to do the same again with more enjoyment never was love or gratitude or shaftesbury  0       bounty practisd but with increasing joy which made the practiser still more in love with the fair act friendship private publick  answer me philocles you who are such a judg of beauty and have so good a taste of pleasure is there any thing you admire so fair as friendship or any thing so charming as a generous action what woud it be therefore if all life were in reality but one continud friendship and coud be made one such intire act here surely woud be that fixd and constant good you sought or woud you look for any thing beyond perhaps not said i but i can never surely go beyond this to seek for a chimera if this good of yours be not thorowly chimerical for tho a poet may possibly work up such a single action so as to hold a play out i can conceive but very faintly how this high strain of friendship can be so managd as to fill a life nor can i imagine where the object lies of such a sublime heroick passion can any friendship said he be so heroick as that towards mankind do you think the love of friends in general and of ones country to be nothing or that particular friendship can well subsist without such an enlargd affection and sense of obligation to society say if possible you are a friend but hate your shaftesbury  0    0  country     say you are true to the interest of a companion but false to that of society can you believe yourself or will you lay the name aside and refuse to be calld the friend since you renounce the man that there is something said i due to mankind is what i think will not be disputed by one who claims the name of friend hardly indeed coud i allow the name of man to one who never coud call or be calld friend but he who justly proves himself a friend is man enough nor is he wanting to society a single friendship may acquit him he has deservd a friend and is mans friend tho not in strictness or according to your high moral sense the friend of mankind for to say truth as to this sort of friendship it may by wiser heads be esteemd perhaps more than ordinarily manly and even heroick as you assert it but for my part i see so very little worth in mankind and have so indifferent an opinion of the publick that i can propose little satisfaction to myself in loving either gratitude do you then take bounty and gratitude to be among the acts of friendship and goodnature undoubtedly for they are the chief suppose then that the obligd person discovers in the shaftesbury  0       obliger several failings does this exclude the gratitude of the former not in the least or does it make the exercise of gratitude less pleasing i think rather the contrary for when deprivd of other means of making a return i might rejoice still in that sure way of shewing my gratitude to my benefactor by bearing his failings as a friend and as to bounty tell me i beseech you bounty  is it to those only who are deserving that we shoud do good is it only to a good neighbour or relation a good father child or brother or does nature reason and humanity better teach us to do good still to a father because a father and to a child because a child and so to every relation in human life i think said i this last is rightest o philocles replyd he consider then what it was you said when you objected against the love of mankind because of human frailty and seemd to scorn the publick because of its misfortunes see if this sentiment be consistent with that humanity     which elsewhere you own and practise for where can generosity exist if not here love of mankind  where can we ever exert friendship if not in this chief subject to what shoud we be true or grateful in the world if not to mankind and that society to which we are so deep shaftesbury  0      ly indebted what are the faults or blemishes which can excuse such an omission or in a grateful mind can ever lessen the satisfaction of making a grateful kind return goodbreeding  can you then out of goodbreeding merely and from a temper natural to you rejoice to shew civility courteousness obligingness seek objects of compassion and be pleasd with every occurrence where you have power to do some service even to people unknown can you delight in such adventures abroad in foreign countrys or in the case of strangers here at home to help assist relieve all who require it in the most hospitable kind and friendly manner and can your country or what is more your kind require less kindness from you or deserve less to be considerd than even one of these chancecreatures—o philocles goodnature  how little do you know the extent and power of goodnature and to what an heroick pitch a soul may rise which knows the thorow force of it and distributing it rightly frames in itself an equal just and universal friendship just as he had ended these words a servant came to us in the field to give notice of some company who were come to dine with us and waited our coming shaftesbury  0       in so we walkd homewards i told theocles going along that i feard i shoud never make a good friend or lover after his way as for a plain natural love of one single person in either sex i coud compass it i thought well enough but this complex universal sort was beyond my reach i coud love the individual but not the species mystical love  this was too mysterious too metaphysical an object for me in short i coud love nothing of which i had not some sensible material image how replyd theocles can you never love except in this manner when yet i know that you admird and lovd a friend long ere you knew his person or was palemons character of no force when it engagd you in that long correspondence which     preceded your late personal acquaintance the fact said i i must of necessity own to you and now methinks i understand your mystery and perceive how i must prepare for it for in the same manner as when i first began to love palemon i was forcd to form a kind of material object and had always such a certain image of him readydrawn in my mind whenever i thought of him so i must endeavour to order it in the case before us if possibly by your help i can raise any shaftesbury  0       such image or specter as may represent this odd being you woud have me love methinks said he you might have the same indulgence for nature or mankind as for the people of old rome whom notwithstanding their blemishes i have known you in love with many ways particularly under the representation of a beautiful youth calld the genius of the people genius of a country  for i remember that viewing once some pieces of antiquity where the people were thus represented you allowd em to be no disagreeable object indeed replyd i were it possible for me to stamp upon my mind such a figure as you speak of whether it stood for mankind or nature nature  it might probably have its effect and i might become perhaps a lover after your way but more especially if you coud so order it as to make things reciprocal between us and bring me to fansy of this genius that it coud be sensible of my love and capable of a return for without this i shoud make but an ill lover tho of the perfectest beauty in the world tis enough said theocles i accept the terms and if you promise to love i will endeavour to shew you that shaftesbury  0       beauty which i count the perfectest and most deserving of love and which will not fail of a return—tomorrow when the eastern sun as poets describe with his first beams adorns the front of yonder hill there if you are content to wander with me in the woods you see we will pursue those loves of ours by favour of the silvan nymphs and invoking first the genius of the place well try to obtain at least some faint and distant view of the sovereign genius and first genius of the world  beauty this if you can come once to contemplate i will answer for it that all those forbidding features and deformitys whether of nature or mankind will vanish in an instant and leave you that     lover i coud wish—but now enough—let us to our company and change this conversation for some other more sutable to our friends and table sect   section ii you see here palemon what a foundation is laid for the enthusiasms i told you of and which in my opinion i told you too were the more dangerous because so very odd and out of the way but curiosity had seizd you i perceivd as it had done me before for after this first conversation i must own i longd shaftesbury  0       for nothing so much as the next day and the appointed morningwalk in the woods we had only a friend or two at dinner with us and for a good while we discoursd of news and indifferent things till i who had my head still running upon those other subjects gladly laid hold of something dropt by chance concerning friendship friendship  and said that for my own part truly tho i once thought i had known friendship and really counted myself a good friend during my whole life yet i was now persuaded to believe myself no better than a learner since theocles had almost convincd me that to be a friend to any one in particular twas necessary to be first a friend to mankind but how to qualify myself for such a friendship was methought no little difficulty indeed said theocles you have given us a very indifferent character of yourself in saying so if you had spoken thus of the friendship of any great man at court or perhaps of a court itself and had complaind how hard it was for you to succeed or make interest with such as governd there we shoud have concluded in your behalf that there were such terms to be complyd with as were unworthy of you but shaftesbury  0       to deserve well of the publick and to be justly styld the friend of mankind virtue  requires no more than to be good and virtuous terms which for ones own sake one woud naturally covet motives how comes it then said i that even these good terms themselves   0 are so ill accepted and hardly ever taken if i may so express it except on further terms for virtue by itself is thought but an ill bargain and i know few even of the religious and devout who take up with it any otherwise than as children do with physick where the rod and sweetmeat are the potent motives they are children indeed replyd theocles and shoud be treated so who need any force or persuasion to do what conduces to their health and good but where i beseech you are those forbidding circumstances which shoud make virtue go down so hardly is it not among other things that you think yourself by this means precluded the fine tables and costly eating of our modern epicures and that perhaps you fear the being reducd to eat always as ill as now upon a plain dish or two and no more this i protested was injuriously supposd of me for i wishd never to eat shaftesbury  0       otherwise than i now did at his table which by the way had more resemblance i thought of epicuruss than those which nowadays preposterously passd under his name for if his opinion might be taken the highest pleasures in the world were owing to temperance and moderate use if then the merest studier of pleasure answerd theocles even epicurus himself made that favourable report of temperance temperance  so different from his modern disciples if he coud boldly say that with such fare as a mean garden afforded he coud vie even with the gods for happiness how shall we say of this part of virtue that it needs be taken upon terms if the immediate practice of temperance be thus harmless are its consequences injurious does it take from the vigour of the mind consume the body and render both the one and the other less apt to their proper exercises the enjoyments of reason or sense or the employments and offices of civil life or is it that a mans circumstances are the worse for it as he stands towards his friends or mankind is a gentleman in this sense to be pityd as one burdensom to himself and others one whom all men will naturally shun as an ill friend and a corrupter shaftesbury  0       of society and good manners—shall we consider our gentleman in a publick trust and     see whether he is like to succeed best with this restraining quality or whether he may be more relyd on and thought more incorrupt if his appetites are high and his relish strong towards that which we call pleasure shall we consider him as a soldier in a campain or siege and advise with ourselves how we might be best defended if we had occasion for such a ones service which officer woud make the best for the soldiers which soldier for the officers or which army for their country—what think you of our gentleman for a fellowtraveller woud he as a temperate man be an ill choice woud it indeed be more eligible and delightful to have a companion who in any shift or necessity woud prove the most ravenous and eager to provide in the first place for himself and his own exquisite sensations—i know not what to say where beauty is concernd perhaps the amorous galants and exquisite refiners on this sort of pleasure may have so refind their minds and tempers that notwithstanding their accustomd indulgence they can upon occasion renounce their enjoyment rather than violate honour faith or justice—and thus at last there will be little virtue or worth shaftesbury  0    0  ascribd to this patient sober character the dull temperate man is no fitter to be trusted than the elegant luxurious one innocence youth and fortune may be as well committed to the care of this latter gentleman he woud prove as good an executor as good a trustee as good a guardian as he woud a friend the family which entrusted him woud be secure and no dishonour in any likelihood woud happen from the honest man of pleasure the seriousness with which theocles spoke this made it the more pleasant and set our other company upon saying a great many good things on the same subject in commendation of a temperate life so that our dinner by this time being ended and the wine according to custom placd before us i found still we were in no likelihood of proceeding to a debauch everyone drank only as he fansyd in no order or proportion and with no regard to circular healths or pledges a manner which the sociable men     of another scheme of morals woud have censurd no doubt as a heinous irregularity and corruption of good fellowship shaftesbury  0      i own said i i am far from thinking temperance so disagreeable a character as for this part of virtue i think there is no need of taking it on any other terms to recommend it than the mere advantage of being savd from intemperance and from the desire of things unnecessary how said theocles are you thus far advancd and can you carry this temperance so far as to estates and honours by opposing it to avarice and ambition—nay then truly you may be said to have fairly embarkd yourself in this cause you have passd the channel and are more than halfseas over there remains no further scruple in the case of virtue unless you will declare yourself a coward or conclude it a happiness to be born one for if you can be temperate withal towards life and think it not so great a business whether it be of fewer or more years but satisfyd with what you have livd can rise a thankful guest from a full liberal entertainment is not this the sum of all the finishing stroke and very accomplishment of virtue in this temper of mind what is there can hinder us from forming for ourselves as heroick a character as we please what is there either good generous or great shaftesbury  0       which does not naturally flow from such a modest temperance let us once gain this simple plainlookd virtue and see whether the more shining virtues will not follow see what that country of the mind will produce when by the wholesom laws of this legislatress it has obtaind its liberty liberty civil  you philocles who are such an admirer of civil liberty and can represent it to yourself with a thousand several graces and advantages can you imagine no grace or beauty in that original native liberty moral  which sets us free from so many inborn tyrannys gives us the privilege of ourselves and makes us our own and independent a sort of property which methinks is as material to us to the full as that which secures us our lands or revenues i shoud think said he carrying on his humour that one might draw the picture of this moral dame to as much advantage as that     of her political sister whom you admire as describd to us in her amazondress with a free manly air becoming her her guards the laws with their written tables like bucklers surrounding her riches traffick and plenty with the cornucopia serving as her attendents and in her train the arts and sciences like children playing—the rest of the piece shaftesbury  0       is easy to imagine her triumph over tyranny and lawless rule of lust and passion—but what a triumph woud her sisters be what monsters of savage passions woud there appear subdud there fierce ambition lust uproar misrule with all the fiends which rage in human breasts woud be securely chaind and when fortune herself the queen of flatterys with that prince of terrors death were at the chariotwheels as captives how natural woud it be to see fortitude magnanimity justice honour and all that generous band attend as the companions of our inmate lady liberty she like some newborn goddess woud grace her mothers chariot and own her birth from humble temperance that nursing mother of the virtues who like the parent of the gods old reverend cybele woud properly appear drawn by reind lions patient of the bit and on her head a turretlike attire the image of defensive power and strength of mind by this picture theocles i found had given entertainment to the company who from this rough draught of his fell to designing upon the same subject after the antient manner till shaftesbury  0       prodicus and cebes and all the antients were exhausted virtue gentlemen said i the descriptions you have been making are no doubt the finest in the world but after all when you have made virtue as glorious and triumphant as you please i will bring you an authentick picture of another kind where we shall see this triumph in reverse virtue herself a captive in her turn and by a proud conqueror triumphd over degraded spoild of all her honours and defacd so as to retain hardly one single feature of real beauty— i offerd to go on further but coud not being so violently decryd     by my two fellowguests who protested they woud never be brought to own so detestable a picture and one of em a formal sort of gentleman somewhat advancd in years looking earnestly upon me said in an angry tone that he had hitherto indeed conceivd some hopes of me notwithstanding he observd my freedom of thought and heard me quoted for such a passionate lover of liberty but he was sorry to find that my principle of liberty extended in fine to a liberty from all principles so he expressd himself and none he thought shaftesbury  0       beside a libertine in principle woud approve of such a picture of virtue as only an atheist coud have the impudence to make theocles the while sat silent tho he saw i minded not my antagonists but kept my eye fixd steddily on himself expecting to hear what he woud say at last fetching a deep sigh o philocles said he how well you are master of that cause you have taken on you to defend how well you know the way to gain advantage to the worst of causes from the imprudent management of those who defend the best—i dare not for my own share affirm to you as my worthy friends have done that tis the atheist alone can lay this load on virtue and picture her thus disgracefully—no—there are other overofficious and less suspected hands which do her perhaps more injury tho with a better colour that virtue shoud with any shew of reason be made a victim continud he turning himself to his guests must have appeard strange to you no doubt to hear asserted with such assurance as has been done by philocles you coud conceive no tolerable ground for such a spectacle in this reversd triumph you expected perhaps to see some foreign con shaftesbury  0      queror exalted as either vice itself or pleasure wit spurious philosophy or some false image of truth or nature little were you aware that the cruel enemy opposd to virtue shoud be religion itself religion and virtue  but you will call to mind that even innocently and without any treacherous design virtue is often treated so by those who woud magnify to the utmost the corruption of mans heart and in exposing as     they pretend the falshood of human virtue think to extol religion how many religious authors how many sacred orators turn all their edge this way and strike at moral virtue as a kind of stepdame or rival to religion—morality must not be namd nature has no pretence reason is an enemy common justice folly and virtue misery who woud not be vitious had he his choice who woud forbear but because he must or who woud value virtue but for hereafter truly said the old gentleman interrupting him if this be the triumph of religion tis such as her greatest enemy i believe woud scarce deny her and i must still be of opinion with philocless leave that it is no great sign of tenderness for religion zeal  to be so zealous in honouring her at the cost of virtue shaftesbury  0      perhaps so said i yet that there are many such zealots in the world you will acknowledg and that there is a certain harmony between this zeal and what you call atheism theocles you hear atheism  has allowd—but let us hear him out if perhaps he will be so free as to discover to us what he thinks of the generality of our religious writers and their method of encountring their common enemy the atheist this is a subject which possibly may need a better clearing for tis notorious that the chief opposers of atheism write upon contrary principles to one another so as in a manner to confute themselves some of em hold zealously for virtue and are realists in the point others one may say are only nominal moralists moralists nominal real  by making virtue nothing in itself a creature of will only or a mere name of fashion tis the same in natural philosophy some take one hypothesis naturalists  and some another i shoud be glad to discover once the true foundation and distinguish those who effectually refute their other antagonists as well as the atheists and rightly assert the jointcause of virtue and religion here palemon i had my wish for by degrees i engagd theocles to shaftesbury  0       discover himself fully upon these subjects which     servd as a prelude to those we were to ingage in the next morning for the approach of which i so impatiently longd if his speculations provd of a rational kind this previous discourse i knew woud help me to comprehend em if only pleasing fancys this woud help me however to please myself the better with em here then began his criticism of authors which grew by degrees into a continud discourse so that had this been at a university theocles might very well have passd for some grave divinityprofessor or teacher of ethicks reading an afternoon lecture to his pupils sect   section iii divinity it woud be undoubtedly said he a happy cause which coud have the benefit of such managers as shoud never give their adversarys any handle of advantage against it i coud wish that in the cause of religion we had reason to boast as much but since tis not impossible to write ill even in the best of causes i am inclind to think this great one of religion may have run at least an equal hazard with any other divines  since they who write in defense of it are apt generally to use so shaftesbury  0       much the less caution as they are more exempt from the fear of censure or criticism in their own person their adversary is well securd and silencd to their hand they may safely provoke him to a field where he cannot appear openly or as a professd antagonist his weapons are private and can often reach the cause without offence to its maintainers whilst no direct attack robs them of their imaginary victory they conquer for themselves and expect to be approvd still for their zeal however the cause itself may have sufferd in their hands— perhaps then said i interrupting him it may be true enough what was said once by a person who seemd zealous for religion that none writ well against the atheists beside the clerk atheist  who drew the warrant for their execution if this were the true writing replyd he there woud be an end     of all dispute or reasoning in the case for where force is necessary reason has nothing to do but on the other hand if reason be needful force in the mean while must be laid aside for there is no enforcement of reason but by reason and therefore if atheists are to be reasond with at all they are to be reasond with like other shaftesbury  0    0  men since theres no other way in nature to convince em this i own said i seems rational and just but im afraid that most of the devout people will be found ready to abandon the patient for the more concise method and tho force without reason may be thought somewhat hard yet your other way of reason without force i am apt to think woud meet with fewer admirers but perhaps replyd theocles tis a mere sound which troubles us the word or name of atheist may possibly occasion some disturbance by being made to describe two characters so very different as his who absolutely denies and his who only doubts now he who doubts may possibly lament his own unhappiness and wish to be convincd he who denies is daringly presumptuous and sets up an opinion against the interest of mankind and being of society tis easily seen that one of these persons may bear a due respect to the magistrate and laws tho not the other who being obnoxious to them punishment  is therefore punishable but how the former is punishable by man will be hard to say unless the magistrate had dominion over minds as well as over actions and behaviour and had power to shaftesbury  0       exercise an inquisition within the inmost bosoms and secret thoughts of men i apprehend you said i and by your account as there are two sorts of people who are calld atheists so there are two ways of writing against them which may be fitly usd apart but not so well jointly you woud set aside mere menaces and separate the philosophers work from the magistrates taking it for granted magistrate  that the more discreet and sober part of unbelievers who come not under the dispatching pen of the magistrate can be affected only by the more deliberate and gentle one of philosophy now the language of the magistrate i must confess has little in common with that of philosophy nothing can be more unbecoming the magisterial     authority than a philosophical style and nothing can be more unphilosophical than a magisterial one a mixture of these must needs spoil both and therefore in the cause before us if any one besides the magistrate can be said to write well tis he according to your account who writes as becomes philosophy with freedom of debate and fairness towards his adversary allow it replyd he for what can be more equitable nothing but shaftesbury  0       will the world be of the same opinion and may this method of writing be justly practisd in it undoubtedly it may and for a proof we have many instances in antiquity to produce philosophy  the freedom taken in this philosophical way was never esteemd injurious to religion or prejudicial to the vulgar since we find it to have been a practice both in writing and converse among the great men of a virtuous and religious people and that even those magistrates who officiated at the altars and were the guardians of the publick worship were sharers in these free debates forgive me theocles said i if i presume to say that still this reaches not the case before us we are to consider christian times such as are now present jealousy of authors  you know the common fate of those who dare to appear fair authors what was that pious and learned mans case who wrote the intellectual system of the universe i confess it was pleasant enough to consider that tho the whole world were no less satisfyd with his capacity and learning than with his sincerity in the cause of deity yet was he acusd of giving the upper hand to the atheists for having only stated their reasons and those of their adversarys fairly together and among other writings of this kind you may remember how a cer shaftesbury  0      tain fair inquiry as you calld it was receivd and what offence was taken at it i am sorry said theocles it provd so but now indeed you have found a way which may perhaps force me to discourse at large with you on this head by entering the lists in defense of a friend unjustly censurd for this philosophical liberty i confessd to theocles and the company that this had really been my aim and that for this reason alone i made myself the     accuser of this author whom i here actually chargd as i did all those other moderate calm writers with no less than profaneness for reasoning so unconcernedly and patiently without the least shew of zeal or passion upon the subject of a deity and a future state and i on the other side replyd theocles am rather for this patient way of reasoning and will endeavour to clear my friend of this imputation if you can have patience enough to hear me out in an affair of such a compass we all answerd for ourselves and he began thus shaftesbury  0      authors of the many writers ingagd in the defense of religion it seems to me that the greatest part are imployd either in supporting the truth of the christian faith in general or in refuting such particular doctrines as are esteemd innovations in the christian church there are not tis thought many persons in the world who are loose in the very grounds and principles of all religion and to such as these we find indeed there are not many writers who purposely apply themselves they may think it a mean labour and scarce becoming them to argue sedately with such as are almost universally treated with detestation and horror but as we are requird by our religion to have charity for all men so we cannot surely avoid having a real concern for those whom we apprehend to be under the worst of errors and whom we find by experience to be with the greatest difficulty reclaimd neither ought they perhaps in prudence to be treated with so little regard whose number however small is thought to be rather increasing and this too among the people of no despicable rank so that it may well deserve some consideration whether in our age and country the same remedys may serve which have hitherto been tryd or shaftesbury  0       whether some other may not be preferd as being sutable to times of less strictness in matters of religion and places less subject to authority this might be enough to put an author upon thinking of such a way of reasoning with these deluded persons as in his opinion   0 might be more effectual for their benefit than the repeated exclamations and invectives with which most of the arguments usd against them are commonly accompanyd nor was it so absurd to imagine that a quite different method might be attempted by which a writer might offer reason to these men with so much more favour and advantage as he appeard unprepossessd and willing to examine every thing with the greatest unconcern and indifference for to such persons as these tis to be feard twill always appear that what was never questiond was never provd and that whatever subject had not at some time or other been examind with perfect indifference was never rightly examind nor coud rightly be believd and in a treatise of this kind offerd as an essay or inquiry only they woud be far from finding that impartiality and indifference which is requisite if instead of a readiness to comply with whatever consequences such an examination as this and the shaftesbury  0       course of reasoning brought forth the author shoud shew a previous inclination to the consequences only on one side and an abhorrence of any conclusion on the other others therefore in different circumstances may perhaps have found it necessary and becoming their character to shew all manner of detestation both of the persons and principles of these men our author on the contrary whose character exceeds not that of a layman endeavours to shew civility and favour by keeping the fairest measures he possibly can with the men of this sort allowing em all he is able and arguing with a perfect indifference even on the subject of a deity he offers to conclude nothing positive himself but leaves it to others to draw conclusions from his principles having this one chief aim and intention how in the first place to reconcile these persons to the principles of virtue that by this means a way might be laid open to religion by removing those greatest if not only obstacles to it which arise from the vices and passions of men fundamental principles tis upon this account he endeavours chiefly to establish virtue on principles by which he is able to argue with those shaftesbury  0       who are not as yet inducd to own a god or future state if he cannot do thus     much he reckons he does nothing for how can supreme goodness be intelligible to those who know not what goodness itself is or how can virtue be understood to deserve reward when as yet its merit and excellence is unknown we begin surely at the wrong end when we woud prove merit by favour and order by a deity—this our friend seeks to redress for being in respect of virtue what you lately calld a realist he endeavours to shew that it is really something in itself and in the nature of things not arbitrary or factitious if i may so speak not constituted from without or dependent on custom fancy or will not even on the supreme will itself which can noway govern it but being necessarily good is governd by it and ever uniform with it and notwithstanding he has thus made virtue his chief subject and in some measure independent on religion yet i fansy he may possibly appear at last as high a divine as he is a moralist theists nominal real i woud not willingly advance it as a rule that those who make only a name of virtue make no more of deity and cannot without affectation defend the principles of religion shaftesbury  0       but this i will venture to assert that whoever sincerely defends virtue and is a realist in morality must of necessity in a manner by the same scheme of reasoning prove as very a realist in divinity all affectation but chiefly in philosophy i must own i think unpardonable and you philocles who can give no quarter to ill reasoning nor endure any unfound or inconsistent hypothesis you will be so ingenuous i dare say as to reject our modern deism and challenge those who assume a name to which their philosophy can never in the least intitle em commend me to honest epicurus who raises his deitys aloft in the imaginary spaces and setting em apart out of the universe and nature of things makes nothing of em beyond a word this is ingenuous and plain dealing for this every one who philosophizes may easily understand the same ingenuity belongs to those philosophers whom you philocles seem inclind to favour when a sceptick questions whether a real theology can be raisd out of philosophy alone     without the help of revelation he does no more than pay a handsom com shaftesbury  0      pliment to authority and the receivd religion he can impose on noone who reasons deeply since whoever does so will easily conceive that at this rate theology must have no foundation at all for revelation itself we know is founded on the acknowledgment of a divine existence and tis the province of philosophy alone to prove what revelation only supposes i look on it therefore as a most unfair way for those who woud be builders and undertake this proving part to lay such a foundation as is insufficient to bear the structure supplanting and undermining may in other cases be fair war but in philosophical disputes tis not allowable to work underground or as in sieges by the sap nothing can be more unbecoming than to talk magisterially and in venerable terms of a supreme nature an infinite being and a deity when all the while a providence is never meant nor any thing like order or the government of a mind admitted for when these are understood and real divinity acknowledgd the notion is not dry and barren but such consequences are necessarily drawn from it as must set us in action and find employment for our strongest affections all the dutys of religion evidently follow hence shaftesbury  0    0  and no exception remains against any of those great maxims which revelation has establishd now whether our friend be unfeignedly and sincerely of this latter sort of real theologists you will learn best from the consequences of his hypothesis you will observe whether instead of ending in mere speculation it leads to practice and you will then surely be satisfyd when you see such a structure raisd as with the generality of the world must pass at least for high religion and with some in all likelihood for no less than enthusiasm for i appeal to you philocles whether there be any thing in divinity which you think has more the air of enthusiasm than that notion of divine love divine love  such as separates from every thing worldly sensual or meanlyinterested a love which is simple pure and unmixd which has no other object than merely the excellency of that being itself nor admits of any other thought of     happiness than in its single fruition now i dare presume you will take it as a substantial proof of my friends being far enough from irreligion if it be shewn that he has espousd this notion and thinks of making out this high point of divinity from arguments familiar even to those who oppose religion shaftesbury  0      according therefore to his hypothesis he woud in the first place by way of prevention declare to you that tho the disinterested love of god were the most excellent principle yet he knew very well that by the indiscreet zeal of some devout wellmeaning people it had been stretchd too far perhaps even to extravagance and enthusiasm as formerly among the mysticks of the antient church mysticks  whom these of latter days have followd on the other hand that there were those who in opposition to this devout mystick way and as professd enemys to what they call enthusiasm had so far exploded every thing of this ecstatick kind as in a manner to have given up devotion and in reality had left so little of zeal affection or warmth in what they call their rational religion as to make them much suspected of their sincerity in any for tho it be natural enough he woud tell you for a mere political writer to ground his great argument for religion on the necessity of such a belief as that of a future reward and punishment yet if you will take his opinion tis a very ill token of sincerity in religion and in the christian religion more especially to reduce it to such a philosophy as will allow no room to that other principle of love but treats all of that kind as enthusiasm shaftesbury  0       for so much as aiming at what is calld disinterestedness or teaching the love of god or virtue for god or virtues sake here then we have two sorts of people according to my friends account who in these opposite extremes expose religion to the insults of its adversarys for as on one hand twill be found difficult to defend the notion of that highraisd love espousd with so much warmth by those devout mysticks so on the other hand twill be found as hard a task upon the principles of these cooler men religion liberal illiberal  to guard religion from the imputation of mercenariness and a slavish spirit for how shall one deny that to serve god     by compulsion or for interest merely is servile and mercenary is it not evident that the only true and liberal service paid either to that supreme being or to any other superior is that which proceeds from an esteem or love of the person servd a sense of duty or gratitude and a love of the dutiful and grateful part as good and amiable in itself and where is the injury to religion from such a concession as this or what detraction is it from the belief of an afterreward or punishment to own that the service causd by it is not equal to that which is voluntary and with inclination but is rather disinge shaftesbury  0      nuous and of the slavish kind is it not still for the good of mankind and of the world that obedience to the rule of right shoud some way or other be paid if not in the better way yet at least in this imperfect one and is it not to be shewn that altho this service of fear be allowd ever so low or base yet religion still being a discipline and progress of the soul towards perfection the motive of reward and punishment is primary and of the highest moment with us rewards and punishments  till being capable of more sublime instruction we are led from this servile state to the generous service of affection and love to this it is that in our friends opinion we ought all of us to aspire so as to endeavour that the excellence of the object not the reward or punishment shoud be our motive but that where thro the corruption of our nature the former of these motives is found insufficient to excite to virtue there the latter shoud be brought in aid supplemental motives  and on no account be undervalud or neglected now this being once establishd how can religion be any longer subject to the imputation of mercenariness but thus we know religion is often chargd godliness say they is great gain nor shaftesbury  0       is god devoutly servd for nought—is this therefore a reproach is it confessd there may be a better service a more generous love—enough there needs no more on this foundation our friend presumes it easy to defend religion and even that devoutest part which is esteemd so great a paradox of faith for if there be in nature such a service as that of affection and love object of love  there remains then only to consider of the object whether there     be really that supremeone we suppose for if there be divine excellence in things if there be in nature a supreme mind or deity we have then an object consummate and comprehensive of all which is good or excellent and this object of all others must of necessity be the most amiable the most ingaging and of highest satisfaction and enjoyment now that there is such a principal object as this in the world the world alone if i may say so by its wise and perfect order must evince this order if indeed perfect excludes all real ill and that it really does so is what our author so earnestly maintains by solving the best he can those untoward phaenomena and ill signs taken from the course of providence in the seemingly unequal lot of virtue in this world tis true tho the appearances hold ever so strongly against virtue and in fa shaftesbury  0      vour of vice the objection which arises hence against a deity may be easily removd and all set right again on the supposal of a future state this to a christian future state  or one already convincd of so great a point is sufficient to clear every dark cloud of providence for he needs not be overandabove sollicitous as to the fate of virtue in this world who is secure of hereafter but the case is otherwise as to the people we are here to encounter they are at a loss for providence and seek to find it in the world the aggravation of the appearing disorders in worldly affairs and the blackest representation of society and human nature will hardly help em to this view twill be difficult for em to read providence in such characters from so uncomely a face of things below they will presume to think unfavourably of all above by the effects they see they will be inclind to judg the cause and by the fate of virtue to determine of a providence but being once convincd of order and a providence as to things present previous proof  they may soon perhaps be satisfyd even of a future state for if virtue be to itself no small reward and vice in a great measure its own punishment we have a solid ground to go upon a providence order  the plain foundations of a distributive justice and due order in this world may lead us to conceive a further building shaftesbury  0       we apprehend a larger scheme and easily resolve ourselves why things were not compleated in this state but their     accomplishment reservd rather to some further period for had the good and virtuous of mankind been wholly prosperous in this life had goodness never met with opposition nor merit ever lain under a cloud where had been the trial victory or crown of virtue where had the virtues had their theater or whence their names where had been temperance or selfdenial where patience meekness magnanimity whence have these their being what merit except from hardship what virtue without a conflict and the encounter of such enemys as arise both within and from abroad but as many as are the difficultys which virtue has to encounter in this world her force is yet superior exposd as she is here she is not however abandond or left miserable she has enough to raise her above pity tho not above our wishes and as happy as we see her here we have room for further hopes in her behalf her present portion is sufficient to shew providence already ingagd on her side and since there is such provision for her here such happiness and such advantages even in this life how probable must it appear that this provi shaftesbury  0      dential care is extended yet further to a succeeding life and perfected hereafter this is what in our friends opinion may be said in behalf of a future state to those who question revelation tis this must render revelation probable and secure that first step to it the belief of a deity and providence recapitulation  a providence must be provd from what we see of order in things present we must contend for order and in this part chiefly where virtue is concernd all must not be referd to a hereafter for a disorderd state in which all present care of things is given up vice uncontrould and virtue neglected represents a very chaos and reduces us to the belovd atoms chance and confusion of the atheists what therefore can be worse done in the cause of a deity than to magnify disorder and exaggerate as some zealous people do the misfortunes of virtue so far as to render it an unhappy choice with respect to this world they err widely who propose to turn men to the thoughts of a better world future state  by making em think so     ill of this for to declaim in this manner against virtue to those of a looser faith will make em the less believe a deity but not the more a future state nor can it be thought sincerely shaftesbury  0       that any man by having the most elevated opinion of virtue and of the happiness it creates favourers of the opinion  was ever the less inclind to the belief of a future state on the contrary it will ever be found that as they who are favourers of vice are always the least willing to hear of a future existence so they who are in love with virtue are the readiest to embrace that opinion which renders it so illustrious and makes its cause triumphant antients thus it was that among the antients the great motive which inclind so many of the wisest to the belief of this doctrine unreveald to em was purely the love of virtue in the persons of those great men the founders and preservers of societys the legislators patriots deliverers heroes whose virtues they were desirous shoud live and be immortalizd nor is there at this day any thing capable of making this belief more engaging among the good and virtuous than the love of friendship friendship  which creates in em a desire not to be wholly separated by death but that they may enjoy the same blessd society hereafter how is it possible then that an author shoud for exalting virtue merely be deemd an enemy to a future state how can our friend be judgd false to religion for defending a principle on which the very notion of god and goodness de shaftesbury  0      pends for this he says only and this is the sum of all that by building a future state on the ruins of virtue conclusion  religion in general and the cause of a deity is betrayd and by making rewards and punishments the principal motives to duty the christian religion in particular is overthrown and its greatest principle that of love rejected and exposd upon the whole then we may justly as well as charitably conclude that it is truly our authors design in applying himself with so much fairness to the men of looser principles to lead em into such an apprehension of the constitution of mankind and of human affairs as might form in em a notion of order in things and draw hence an acknowledgment of that wisdom goodness     and beauty which is supreme that being thus far become proselytes they might be prepard for that divine love which our religion woud teach em when once they shoud embrace its precepts and form themselves to its sacred character thus continud he i have made my friends apology which may have shewn him to you perhaps a good moralist and i hope no enemy to religion shaftesbury  0    0  but if you find still that the divine has not appeard so much in his character as i promisd i can never think of satisfying you in any ordinary way of conversation shoud i offer to go further i might be ingagd deeply in spiritual affairs and be forcd to make some new model of a sermon upon his system of divinity however i am in hopes now that in good earnest matters are come well nigh to preaching you will acquit me for what i have already performd sect   section iv just as he had made an end of speaking came in some visitants who took us up the remaining part of the afternoon in other discourses but these being over and our strangers gone all except the old gentleman and his friend who had dind with us we began anew with theocles by laying claim to his sermon and intreating him again and again to let us hear him at large in his theological way this he complaind was persecuting him as you have seen company said he often persecute a reputed singer not out of any fancy for the musick but to satisfy a malicious sort of curiosity which ends commonly in censure and dislike shaftesbury  0      however it might be we told him we were resolvd to persist and i assurd our companions that if they woud second me heartily in the manner i intended to press him we shoud easily get the better in revenge then said he i will comply on this condition that     since i am to sustain the part of the divine and preacher it shall be at philocless cost who shall bear the part of the infidel and stand for the person preachd to truly said the old gentleman the part you have proposd for him is so natural and sutable that i doubt not he will be able to act it without the least pain i coud wish rather that you had spard yourself the trouble of putting him thus in mind of his proper character he woud have been apt enough of his own accord to interrupt your discourse by his perpetual cavils therefore since we have now had entertainment enough by way of dialogue i desire the law of sermon may be strictly observd and that there be no answering to whatever is argud or advancd i consented to all the terms and told theocles i woud stand his mark shaftesbury  0       willingly and besides if i really were that infidel he was to suppose me i shoud count it no unhappiness since i was sure of being so thorowly convincd by him if he woud vouchsafe to undertake me theocles then proposd we shoud walk out the evening being fine and the free air suting better as he thought with such discourses than a chamber accordingly we took our eveningwalk in the fields from whence the laborious hinds were now retiring we fell naturally into the praises of a country life and discoursd awhile of husbandry and the nature of the soil our friends began to admire some of the plants which grew here to great perfection and it being my fortune as having acquird a little insight into the nature of simples to say something they mightily approvd upon this subject theocles immediately turning about to me o my ingenious friend said he whose reason in other respects must be allowd so clear and happy how is it possible that with such insight and accurate judgment in the particulars of natural beings and operations you shoud no better judg of the structure of things in general and of the order and frame shaftesbury  0       of nature who better than yourself can shew the structure of each plant   0 and animalbody declare the office of every part and organ organization  and tell the uses ends and advantages to which they serve how therefore shoud you prove so ill a naturalist in this whole and understand so little the anatomy of the world and nature as not to discern the same relation of parts the same consistency and uniformity in the universe some men perhaps there are of so confusd a thought and so irregularly formd within themselves that tis no more than natural for them to find fault and imagine a thousand inconsistences and defects in this wider constitution twas not we may presume the absolute aim or interest of the universal nature to render every privateone infallible and without defect twas not its intention to leave us without some pattern of imperfection such as we perceive in minds like these perplexd with froward thought but you my friend are master of a nobler mind you are conscious of better order within and can see workmanship and exactness in yourself and other innumerable parts of the creation can you answer it to yourself allowing thus much shaftesbury  0       not to allow all can you induce yourself ever to believe or think that where there are parts so variously united and conspiring fitly within themselves whole and parts  the whole itself shoud have neither union nor coherence and where inferior and private natures are often found so perfect the universalone shoud want perfection and be esteemd like whatsoever can be thought of most monstrous rude and imperfect strange that there shoud be in nature the idea of an order and perfection which nature herself wants that beings which arise from nature shoud be so perfect as to discover imperfection in her constitution and be wise enough to correct that wisdom by which they were made nothing surely is more strongly imprinted on our minds or more closely interwoven with our souls than the idea or sense of order and proportion proportion  hence all the force of numbers and those powerful arts founded on their management and use what a difference there is between harmony and discord cadency and convulsion what a difference between composd and orderly motion and that which is ungovernd and accidental between the re shaftesbury  0      gular     and uniform pile of some noble architect and a heap of sand or stones between an organizd body and a mist or cloud driven by the wind now as this difference is immediately perceivd by a plain internal sensation so there is withal in reason this account of it that whatever things have order union  the same have unity of design and concur in one are parts constituent of one whole or are in themselves intire systems such is a tree with all its branches an animal with all its members an edifice with all its exterior and interior ornaments what else is even a tune or symphony or any excellent piece of musick than a certain system of proportiond sounds system now in this which we call the universe whatever the perfection may be of any particular systems or whatever single parts may have proportion unity or form within themselves yet if they are not united all in general in one system but are in shaftesbury  0       respect of one     another as the driven sands or clouds or breaking waves then there being no coherence in the whole there can be inferd no order no proportion and consequently no project or design but if none of these parts are independent but all apparently united then is the whole a system compleat according to one simple consistent and uniform design here then is our main subject insisted on that neither man nor any other animal tho ever so compleat a system of parts as to all within can be allowd in the same manner compleat as to all without but must be considerd as having a further relation abroad to the system of his kind animalsystem  so even this system of his kind to the animalsystem this to the world our earth and this again to the bigger world and to the universe shaftesbury  0      all things in this world are united system of the world  for as the branch is united with the tree so is the tree as immediately with the earth air and water which feed it as much as the fertile mould is fitted to the tree as much as the strong and upright trunk of the oak or elm is fitted to the twining branches of the vine or ivy so much are the very leaves the seeds and fruits of these trees fitted to the various animals these again to one another and to the elements where they live and to which they are as appendices in a manner fitted and joind as either by wings for the air fins for the water feet for the earth and by other correspondent inward parts of a more curious frame and texture thus in contemplating all on earth we must of necessity view all in one as holding to one common stock thus too in the system of the bigger world see there the mutual dependency of things the relation of one to another of the sun to this inhabited earth and of the earth and other planets to the sun the order union and coherence of the whole and know my ingenious friend universal system  that by this survey you will be obligd to own the universal system and coherent scheme of things to be establishd on shaftesbury  0       abundant proof capable of convincing any fair and just contemplator of the works of nature for scarce woud anyone till he had well surveyd this universal scheme believe a union thus evidently demonstrable by such numerous and powerful     instances of mutual correspondency and relation from the minutest ranks and orders of beings to the remotest spheres appearance of ill necessary now in this mighty union if there be such relations of parts one to another as are not easily discoverd if on this account the end and use of things does not everywhere appear there is no wonder since tis no more indeed than what must happen of necessity nor coud supreme wisdom have otherwise orderd it for in an infinity of things thus relative a mind which sees not infinitely can see nothing fully and since each particular has relation to all in general it can know no perfect or true relation of any thing in a world not perfectly and fully known solution the same may be considerd in any dissected animal plant or flower where he who is no anatomist nor versd in natural history sees that the many parts have a relation to the whole shaftesbury  0       for thus much even a slight view affords but he who like you my friend is curious in the works of nature and has been let into a knowledge of the animal and vegetable worlds he alone can readily declare the just relation of all these parts to one another and the several uses to which they serve example but if you woud willingly enter further into this thought and consider how much we ought not only to be satisfyd with this our view of things but even to admire its clearness imagine only some person intirely a stranger to navigation and ignorant of the nature of the sea or waters how great his astonishment woud be when finding himself on board some vessel anchoring at sea remote from all landprospect whilst it was yet a calm he viewd the ponderous machine firm and motionless in the midst of the smooth ocean and considerd its foundations beneath together with its cordage masts and sails above how easily woud he see the whole one regular structure all things depending on one another the uses of the rooms below the lodgments and conveniences of men and stores but being ignorant of the intent or design of all above shaftesbury  0    0  woud he pronounce the masts and cordage to be useless and cumbersom and for this reason condemn the frame and despise the architect o my friend let us not thus     betray our ignorance but consider where we are and in what a universe think of the many parts of the vast machine in which we have so little insight and of which it is impossible we shoud know the ends and uses when instead of seeing to the highest pendants we see only some lower deck and are in this dark case of flesh confind even to the hold and meanest station of the vessel now having recognizd this uniform consistent fabrick and ownd the universal system universal mind  we must of consequence acknowledg a universal mind which no ingenious man can be tempted to disown except thro the imagination of disorder in the universe its seat for can it be supposd of anyone in the world that being in some desart far from men and hearing there a perfect symphony of musick or seeing an exact pile of regular architecture arising gradually from the earth in all its orders and proportions he shoud be persuaded that at the bottom there was no design accompanying this no secret spring of thought no active mind shaftesbury  0       woud he because he saw no hand deny the handywork and suppose that each of these compleat and perfect systems were framd and thus united in just symmetry and conspiring order either by the accidental blowing of the winds or rolling of the sands what is it then shoud so disturb our views of nature disturbance whence  as to destroy that unity of design and order of a mind which otherwise woud be so apparent all we can see either of the heavens or earth demonstrates order and perfection so as to afford the noblest subjects of contemplation to minds like yours enrichd with sciences and learning all is delightful amiable rejoicing except with relation to man only human affairs  and his circumstances which seem unequal here the calamity and ill arises and hence the ruin of this goodly frame all perishes on this account and the whole order of the universe elsewhere so firm intire and immoveable is here oerthrown and lost by this one view in which we refer all things to ourselves selfishness  submitting the interest of the whole to the good and interest of so small a part but how is it you complain of the unequal state of man and of the few shaftesbury  0       advantages allowd him above the beasts what can     a creature claim so little differing from em or whose merit appears so little above em except in wisdom and virtue to which so few conform man may be virtuous and by being so is happy his merit is reward by virtue he deserves and in virtue only can meet his happiness deservd but if even virtue itself be unprovided for virtue and vice  and vice more prosperous be the better choice if this as you suppose be in the nature of things then is all order in reality inverted and supreme wisdom lost imperfection and irregularity being after this manner undoubtedly too apparent in the moral world have you then ere you pronouncd this sentence their power effect  considerd of the state of virtue and vice with respect to this life merely so as to say with assurance when and how far in what particulars and how circumstantiated the one or the other is good or ill you who are skilld in other fabricks and compositions both of art and nature have you considerd of the fabrick of the mind a mind  the constitution of the soul the connexion and frame of all its passions and affections to know accordingly the order and symmetry of the part shaftesbury  0       and how it either improves or suffers what its force is when naturally preservd in its found state improvement  and what becomes of it when corrupted and abusd till this my friend be well examind and understood how shall we judg either of the force of virtue or power of vice or in what manner either of these may work to our happiness or undoing here therefore is that inquiry we shoud first make but who is there can afford to make it as he ought if happily we are born of a good nature if a liberal education has formd in us a generous temper and disposition temper  wellregulated appetites and worthy inclinations tis well for us and so indeed we esteem it but who is there endeavours to give these to himself or to advance his portion of happiness in this kind who thinks of improving or so much as of preserving his share in a world where it must of necessity run so great a hazard and where we know an honest nature is so easily corrupted all other things relating to us are preservd with care and have some art or oeconomy belonging to em     this which is nearest related to us and on which our happiness depends is alone committed to shaftesbury  0       chance and temper is the only thing ungovernd whilst it governs all the rest appetites thus we inquire concerning what is good and sutable to our appetites but what appetites are good and sutable to us is no part of our examination we inquire what is according to interest policy fashion vogue but it seems wholly strange and out of the way to inquire what is according to nature the balance of europe of trade of power is strictly sought after while few have heard of the balance of their passions balance  or thought of holding these scales even few are acquainted with this province or knowing in these affairs but were we more so as this inquiry woud make us we shoud then see beauty and decorum here as well as elsewhere in nature and the order of the moral world woud equal that of the natural by this the beauty of virtue woud appear and hence as has been shewn virtue deity  the supreme and sovereign beauty the original of all which is good or amiable but lest i shoud appear at last too like an enthusiast i chuse to express my sense and conclude this philosophical sermon in the words of one of those an shaftesbury  0      tient philologists whom you are usd to esteem for divinity itself says he is surely beauteous and of all beautys the brightest tho not a beauteous body but that from whence the beauty of bodys is derivd not a beauteous plain but that from whence the plain looks beautiful the rivers beauty the seas the heavens and heavenly constellations all flow from hence as from a source eternal and incorruptible as beings partake of this they are fair and flourishing and happy as they are lost to this they are deformd perishd and lost when theocles had thus spoken he was formally complimented by our two companions i was going to add something in the same way but he presently stopd me by saying he shoud be scandalizd if instead of commending him i did not according to my character chuse rather to criticize some part or other of his long discourse     if it must be so then replyd i in the first place give me leave to wonder that instead of the many arguments commonly brought for proof of a deity you make use only of one singleone to build on i expected to have heard from you in custo shaftesbury  0      mary form of a first cause a first being and a beginning of motion how clear the idea was of an immaterial substance and how plainly it appeard matter and thought  that at some time or other matter must have been created but as to all this you are silent as for what is said of a material unthinking substance being never able to have producd an immaterial thinking one i readily grant it but on the condition that this great maxim of nothing being ever made from nothing may hold as well on my side as my adversarys and then i suppose that whilst the world endures he will be at a loss how to assign a beginning to matter or how to suggest a possibility of annihilating it the spiritual men may as long as they please represent to us in the most eloquent manner that matter considerd in a thousand different shapes joind and disjoind varyd and modifyd to eternity can never of itself afford one single thought never occasion or give rise to any thing like sense or knowledg their argument will hold good against a democritus an epicurus or any of the elder or latter atomists but it will be turnd on them by an examining academist and when the two substances are fairly set asunder and considerd apart as different kinds twill be as strong sense and as good argument to say as shaftesbury  0       well of the immaterial kind that do with it as you please modify it a thousand ways purify it exalt it sublime it torture it ever so much or rack it as they say with thinking you will never be able to produce or force the contrary substance out of it the poor dregs of sorry matter can no more be made out of the simple pure substance of immaterial thought than the high spirits of thought or reason can be extracted from the gross substance of heavy matter so let the dogmatists make of this argument what they can but for your part continud i as you have stated the question tis not about what was first or foremost but what is instant and now in being for if deity be now really extant if by any     good token it appears that there is at this present a universal mind twill easily be yielded there ever was one—this is your argument—you go if i may say so upon fact and woud prove that things actually are in such a state and condition which if they really were there woud indeed be no dispute left your union is your main support yet how is it you prove this what demonstration have you given what have you so much as offerd at beyond bare probability so far are you from demon shaftesbury  0      strating any thing that if this uniting scheme be the chief argument for deity as you tacitly allow you seem rather to have demonstrated that the case itself is incapable of demonstration for how say you can a narrow mind see all things—and yet if in reality it sees not all it had as good see nothing the demonstrable part is still as far behind for grant that this all which lies within our view or knowledg is orderly and united as you suppose this mighty all is a mere point still a very nothing compard to what remains atheistical hypothesis   tis only a separate byworld well say of which perhaps there are in the wide waste millions besides as horrid and deformd as this of ours is regular and proportiond in length of time amidst the infinite hurry and shock of beings this single odd world by accident might have been struck out and cast into some form as among infinite chances what is there which may not happen but for the rest of matter tis of a different hue old father chaos as the poets call him in these wild spaces reigns absolute and upholds his realms of darkness he presses hard upon our frontier and one day belike shall by a furious inroad recover his lost right conquer his rebelstate and re shaftesbury  0      unite us to primitive discord and confusion this said i theocles concluding my discourse is all i dare offer in opposition to your philosophy i imagind indeed you might have given me more scope but you have retrenchd yourself in narrower bounds so that to tell you truth i look upon your theology to be hardly so fair or open as that of our divines in general they are strict its true as to names but allow a greater latitude in things hardly indeed can they bear a homecharge     a downright questioning of deity but in return they give always fair play against nature nature arraignd  and allow her to be challengd for her failings she may freely err and we as freely censure deity they think is not accountable for her only she for herself but you are straiter and more precise in this point you have unnecessarily brought nature into the controversy and taken upon you to defend her honour so highly that i know not whether it may be safe for me to question her let not this trouble you replyd theocles but be free to censure nature whatever may be the consequence tis only my hypothesis can suffer if i defend it ill my friends need not be scan shaftesbury  0   00 dalizd they are fortifyd no doubt with stronger arguments for a deity and can well employ those metaphysical weapons of whose edge you seem so little apprehensive i leave them to dispute this ground with you whenever they think fit for my own arguments if they can be supposd to make any part of this defense they may be lookd upon only as distant lines or outworks which may easily perhaps be won but without any danger to the body of the place notwithstanding then said i that you are willing i shoud attack nature in form i chuse to spare her in all other subjects except man only how comes it i intreat you nature in man  that in this noblest of creatures and worthiest her care she shoud appear so very weak and impotent whilst in mere brutes and the irrational species she acts with so much strength in brutes  and exerts such hardy vigour why is she spent so soon in feeble man who is found more subject to diseases and of fewer years than many of the wild creatures they range secure and proof against all the injurys of seasons and weather want no help from art but live in careless ease dischargd of labour and freed from the cumbersom baggage of a necessitous human shaftesbury  0   0   life in infancy more helpful vigorous in age with senses quicker and more natural sagacity they pursue their interests joys recreations and cheaply purchase both their food and maintenance clothd and armd by   0 nature herself who provides them both a couch and mansion so has nature orderd for the rest of creatures such is their hardiness robustness vigour why not the same for man— and do you stop thus short said theocles in your expostulation methinks twere as easy to proceed now you are in the way and instead of laying claim to some few advantages of other creatures you might as well stand for all and complain that man for his part nature in man  shoud be any thing less than a consummation of all advantages and privileges which nature can afford ask not merely why man is naked why unhoofd why slowerfooted than the beasts ask why he has not wings also for the air fins for the water and so on that he might take possession of each element and reign in all not so said i neither this woud be to rate him high indeed as if he were by nature lord of all which is more than i coud willingly allow shaftesbury  0   0  tis enough replyd he that this is yielded for if we allow once a subordination in his case if nature herself be not for man but man for nature then must man by his good leave submit to the elements of nature and not the elements to him few of these are at all fitted to him and none perfectly if he be left in air he falls headlong for wings were not assignd him in water he soon sinks in fire he consumes within earth he suffocates— as for what dominion he may naturally have in other elements said i my concern truly is not very great in his behalf since by art he can even exceed the advantages nature has given to other creatures but for the air methinks it had been wonderfully obliging in nature to have allowd him wings volatiles and what woud he have gaind by it replyd theocles for consider what an alteration of form must have ensud observe in one of those wingd creatures whether the whole structure be not made subservient to this purpose and all other advantages sacrificd to this single operation anatomy  the anatomy of the creature shews it in a manner to be all wing its chief bulk being composd of shaftesbury  0   0   two exorbitant muscles which exhaust the strength of     all the other and engross if i may say so the whole oeconomy of the frame tis thus the aerial racers are able to perform so rapid and strong a motion beyond comparison with any other kind and far exceeding their little share of strength elsewhere these parts of theirs being made in such superior proportion as in a manner to starve their companions and in mans architecture of so different an order were the flying engines to be affixd must not the other members suffer and the multiplyd parts starve one another what think you of the brain in this partition the brain  is it not like to prove a starveling or woud you have it be maintaind at the same high rate and draw the chief nourishment to itself from all the rest— i understand you said i theocles interrupting him the brain certainly is a great starver where it abounds and the thinking people of the world the philosophers and virtuosos especially must be contented i find with a moderate share of bodily advantages for the sake of what they call parts and capacity in another sense parts  the parts it seems of one kind agree ill in their oeconomy with the parts of the other but to make this even on both sides let us shaftesbury  0   0   turn the tables and the case i suppose will stand the same with the milos of the age the men of bodily prowess and dexterity for not to mention a vulgar sort such as wrestlers vaulters racers hunters what shall we say of our finebred gentlemen our riders fencers dancers tennisplayers and such like tis the body surely is the starver here and if the brain were such a terrible devourer in the other way the body and bodily parts seem to have their reprisals in this rank of men if then said he the case stands thus between man and man how must it stand between man and a quite different creature if the balance be so nice balance  that the least thing breaks it even in creatures of the same frame and order of what fatal effect must it be to change the order itself and make some essential alteration in the frame consider therefore how it is we censure nature in these and suchlike cases why says one was i not made by nature strong as a horse why not hardy and robust as this brutecreature     or nimble and active as that other—and yet when uncommon strength agility and feats of body are subjoind even in our own species see what befals so that for a person thus in love with an athletick milo shaftesbury  0   0  nean constitution it were better methinks and more modest in him to change the expostulation and ask why was i not made in good earnest a very brute for that woud be more sutable i am apt indeed said i to think that the excellence of man lies somewhat different from that of a brute and that such amongst us as are more truly men shoud naturally aspire to manly qualitys and leave the brute his own but nature i see has done well to mortify us in this particular by furnishing us with such slight stuff and in such a tender frame as is indeed wonderfully commodious to support that manexcellence of thought and reason but wretchedly scanty and ineffectual for other purposes as if it were her very design to hinder us from aspiring ridiculously to what was misbecoming our character i see said theocles you are not one of those timorous arguers who tremble at every objection raisd against their opinion or belief and are so intent in upholding their own side of the argument that they are unable to make the least concession on the other your wit allows you to divert yourself with whatever oc shaftesbury  0   0  curs in the debate and you can pleasantly improve even what your antagonist brings as a support to his own hypothesis this indeed is a fairer sort of practice than what is common nowadays but tis no more than sutable to your character and were i not afraid of speaking with an air of compliment in the midst of a philosophical debate i shoud tell you perhaps what i thought of the becoming manner of your scepticism in opposition to a kind of bigotscepticks who forfeit their right to the philosophick character and retain hardly so much as that of the gentleman or good companion—but to our argument— distribution such then continud he is the admirable distribution of nature her adapting and adjusting not only the stuff or matter to the shape and form and even the shape itself and form to     the circumstance place element or region but also the affections appetites sensations mutually to each other as well as to the matter form action and all besides all managd for the best with perfect frugality and just reserve profuse to none but bountiful to all never employing in one thing more than enough but with exact oeconomy retrenching the superfluous and adding force to what is principal in every thing and shaftesbury  0   0   is not thought and reason principal in man woud he have no reserve for these no saving for this part of his engine principal part  or woud he have the same stuff or matter the same instruments or organs serve alike for different purposes and an ounce be equivalent to a pound—it cannot be what wonders then can he expect from a few ounces of blood in such a narrow vessel fitted for so small a district of nature will he not rather think highly of that nature which has thus managd his portion for him to best advantage with this happy reserve happy indeed for him if he knows and uses it by which he has so much a better use of organs than any other creature by which he holds his reason is a man reason  and not a beast but beasts said i have instincts instinct  which man has not true said he they have indeed perceptions sensations and †presensations if i may use the expression which man animals  for his part has not in any proportionable degree their females newly pregnant and before they have bore young have a clear prospect or presensation of their state shaftesbury  0   0   which is to follow know what to provide and how in what manner and at what time how many things do they preponderate how many at once comprehend the seasons of the year the country climate place aspect situation the basis of their building the materials architecture the diet and treatment of their offspring in short the whole oeconomy of their nursery and all this as perfectly at first and when unexperiencd as at any time of their life afterwards and why not this say you in human kind human kind  nay rather on     the contrary i ask why this where was the occasion or use where the necessity why this sagacity for men have they not what is better in another kind have they not reason and discourse does not this instruct them what need then of the other where woud be the prudent management at this rate where the reserve the young of most other kinds continud he are instantly helpful to themselves sensible vigorous known to shun danger and seek their good a human infant is of all the most helpless weak infirm and wherefore shoud it not have been thus orderd where is the loss in such a species or what is man the worse for this defect amidst such large sup shaftesbury  0   0  plies does not this defect engage him the more strongly to society society  and force him to own that he is purposely and not by accident made rational and sociable and can no otherwise increase or subsist than in that social intercourse and community which is his natural state is not both conjugal affection and natural affection to parents duty to magistrates love of a common city community or country with the other dutys and social parts of life deducd from hence and founded in these very wants what can be happier than such a deficiency as is the occasion of so much good what better than a want so abundantly made up and answerd by so many enjoyments now if there are still to be found among mankind such as even in the midst of these wants seem not ashamd to affect a right of independency and deny themselves to be by nature sociable where woud their shame have been had nature otherwise supplyd these wants what duty or obligation had been ever thought of what respect or reverence of parents magistrates their country or their kind woud not their full and selfsufficient state more strongly have determind them to throw off nature and deny the ends and author of their creation shaftesbury  0    0 whilst theocles argud thus concerning nature the old gentleman my adversary expressd great satisfaction in hearing me as he thought refuted and my opinions exposd for he woud     needs believe these to be strongly my opinions which i had only started as objections in the discourse he endeavourd to reinforce the argument by many particulars from the common topicks of the schoolmen and civilians he added withal that it was better for me to declare my sentiments openly for he was sure i had strongly imbibd that principle state of nature  that the state of nature was a state of war that it was no state of government or publick rule replyd i you yourself allow i do so was it then a state of fellowship or society no for when men enterd first into society they passd from the state of nature into that new one which is founded upon compact and was that former state a tolerable one had it been absolutely intolerable there had never been any such nor coud we properly call that a state which coud not stand or endure for the least time if man therefore shaftesbury  0       coud endure to live without society and if it be true that he actually livd so when in the state of nature how can it be said that he is by nature sociable the old gentleman seemd a little disturbd at my question but having recoverd himself he said in answer that man indeed from his own natural inclination might not perhaps have been movd to associate but rather from some particular circumstances his nature then said i was not so very good it seems since having no natural affection or friendly inclination belonging to him he was forcd into a social state against his will and this not from any necessity in respect of outward things for you have allowd him a tolerable subsistence but in probability from such inconveniences as arose chiefly from himself and his own malignant temper and principles and indeed twas no wonder if creatures who were naturally thus unsociable shoud be as naturally mischievous and troublesom if according to their nature they coud live out of society with so little affection for one anothers company tis not likely that upon occasion they woud spare one     anothers persons if they were so sullen as not to meet for love tis more than probable shaftesbury  0       they woud fight for interest and thus from your own reasoning it appears that the state of nature must in all likelihood have been little different from a state of war he was going to answer me with some sharpness as by his looks appeard when theocles interposing desird that as he had occasiond this dispute he might be allowd to try if he coud end it by setting the question in a fairer light you see said he to the old gentleman what artifice philocles made use of when he engagd you to allow that the state of nature and that of society were perfectly distinct but let us question him now in his turn and see whether he can demonstrate to us that there can be naturally any human state which is not social what is it then said the old gentleman which we call the state of nature not that imperfect rude condition of mankind said theocles which some imagine but which if it ever were in nature coud never have been of the least continuance or anyway tolerable or sufficient for the support of human race such a condition cannot indeed so properly be calld a state for what if shaftesbury  0       speaking of an infant just coming into the world and in the moment of the birth i shoud fansy to call this a state woud it be proper hardly so i confess just such a state therefore was that which we suppose of man ere yet he enterd into society and became in truth a human creature twas the rough draught of man the essay or first effort of nature a species in the birth a kind as yet unformd not in its natural state but under violence and still restless till it attaind its natural perfection and thus said theocles addressing still more particularly to the old gentleman the case must necessarily stand even on the supposal that there was ever such a condition or state of men when as yet they were unassociated unacquainted and consequently without any language or form of art but that it was their natural state to live thus separately can never without absurdity be allowd for sooner may you divest the creature of any     other feeling or affection than that towards society and his likeness allowing you however the power of divesting him at pleasure allowing you to reduce even whole shaftesbury  0       parts and members of his present frame woud you transform him thus and call him still a man yet better might you do this indeed than you coud strip him of his natural affections separate him from all his kind and inclosing him like some solitary insect in a shell declare him still a man so might you call the human egg or embrio the man the bug which breeds the butterfly is more properly a fly tho without wings than this imaginary creature is a man for tho his outward shape were human his passions appetites and organs must be wholly different his whole inward make must be reversd to fit him for such a recluse oeconomy and separate subsistence to explain this a little further continud he let us examine this pretended state of nature how and on what foundation it must stand for either man must have been from eternity or not if from eternity there coud be no primitive or original state no state of nature other than we see at present before our eyes if not from eternity he arose either all at once and consequently he was at the very first as he is now or by degrees thro several stages and conditions to that in which he is at length settled and has continud for so many generations shaftesbury  0      for instance let us suppose he sprang as the old poets feignd from a bigbellyd oak and then belike he might resemble more a mandrake than a man let us suppose him at first with little more of life than is discoverd in that plant which they call the sensitive but when the motheroak had been some time deliverd and the false birth by some odd accident or device was wrought into form the members were then fully displayd and the organs of sense began to unfold themselves here sprang an ear there peepd an eye perhaps a tail too came in company for what superfluitys nature may have been chargd with at first is difficult to determine they dropt off it seems in time and happily have left things at last in a good posture and to a wonder just as they should be this surely is the lowest view of the original affairs of human     kind for if a providence and not chance gave man his being our argument for his social nature must surely be the stronger but admitting his rise to be as we have describd and as a certain sort of philosophers woud needs have it nature has then had no intention at all no meaning or design in this whole matter so how shaftesbury  0       any thing can be calld natural in the case how any state can be calld a state of nature or according to nature one more than another i know not let us go on however and on their hypothesis consider which state we may best call natures own she has by accident thro many changes and chances raisd a creature which springing at first from rude seeds of matter proceeded till it became what now it is and arrivd where for many generations it has been at a stay in this long procession for i allow it any length whatever i ask where was it that this state of nature coud begin the creature must have endurd many changes and each change whilst he was thus growing up was as natural one as another so that either there must be reckond a hundred different states of nature or if one it can be only that in which nature was perfect and her growth compleat here where she rested and attaind her end here must be her state or nowhere coud she then rest think you in that desolate state before society coud she maintain and propagate the species such as it now is without fellowship or community shew it us in fact any shaftesbury  0      where amongst any of our own kind for as for creatures which may much resemble us in outward form if they differ yet in the least part of their constitution if their inwards are of a different texture if their skin and pores are otherwise formd or hardend if they have other excrescences of body another temper other natural inseparable habits or affections they are not truly of our kind if on the other hand their constitution be as ours their natural parts or inward facultys as strong and their bodily frame as weak as ours if they have memory and senses and affections and a use of organs as ours tis evident they can no more by their goodwill abstain from society than they can possibly preserve themselves without it     and here my friends we ought to remember what we discoursd awhile since and was advancd by philocles himself concerning the weakness of human bodys and the necessitous state of man in respect of all other creatures his long and helpless infancy his feeble and defenseless make by which he is more fitted to be a prey himself than live by prey on others yet tis impossible for him to subsist like any of those shaftesbury  0       grazing kinds he must have better provision and choicer food than the raw herbage a better couch and covering than the bare earth or open sky how many conveniences of other kinds does he stand in need of what union and strict society is requird between the sexes to preserve and nurse their growing offspring this kind of society will not surely be denyd to man which to every beast of prey is known proper and natural and can we allow this social part to man and go no further is it possible he shoud pair and live in love and fellowship with his partner and offspring and remain still wholly wild and speechless and without those arts of storing building and other oeconomy as natural to him surely as to the beaver or to the ant or bee where therefore shoud he break off from this society if once begun for that it began thus as early as generation and grew into a houshold and oeconomy is plain must not this have grown soon into a tribe and this tribe into a nation or tho it remaind a tribe only was not this still a society for mutual defense and common interest in short if generation be natural if natural affection and the care and nurture of the offspring be natural things standing as they do with man and the creature being of that form and constitu shaftesbury  0      tion he now is it follows that society must be also natural to him and that out of society and community he never did nor ever can subsist to conclude said he addressing still to the two companions i will venture to add a word in behalf of philocles that since the learned have such a fancy for this notion and love to talk of this imaginary state of nature i think tis even charity to speak as ill of   0 it as we possibly can let it be a state of war rapine and injustice since tis unsocial let it een be as uncomfortable and as frightful as tis possible to speak well of it is to render it inviting and tempt men to turn hermites let it at least be lookd on as many degrees worse than the worst government in being the greater dread we have of anarchy the better countrymen we shall prove and value more the laws and constitution under which we live and by which we are protected from the outrageous violences of such an unnatural state in this i agree heartily with those transformers of human nature who considering it abstractedly and apart from government or society represent it under monstrous visages of dragons leviathans and i know not what devouring creatures they woud have done well however to have expressd shaftesbury  0    0  themselves more properly in their great maxim for to say in disparagement of man that he is to man a wolf appears somewhat absurd when one considers that wolves are to wolves very kind and loving creatures the sexes strictly join in the care and nurture of the young and this union is continud still between em they houl to one another to bring company whether to hunt or invade their prey or assemble on the discovery of a good carcase even the swinish kinds want not common affection and run in herds to the assistance of their distressd fellows the meaning therefore of this famous sentence if it has any meaning at all must be that man is naturally to man as a wolf is to a tamer creature as for instance to a sheep but this will be as little to the purpose as to tell us that there are different species or characters of men that all have not this wolfish nature but that one half at least are naturally innocent and mild and thus the sentence comes to nothing for without belying nature and contradicting what is evident from natural history fact and the plain course of things tis impossible to assent to this illnaturd proposition when we have even done our best to make tolerable sense of it—but such is man shaftesbury  0      kind and even here human nature shews itself such     as it is not perfect or absolutely successful tho rightly tending sect    and movd by proper and just principles tis here therefore in philosophy as in the common conversations of the world as fond as men are of company and as little able to enjoy any happiness out of it they are yet strangely addicted to the way of satir and in the same manner as a malicious censure craftily worded and pronouncd with assurance is apt to pass with mankind for shreud wit so a virulent maxim in bold expressions tho without any justness of thought is readily receivd for true philosophy sect   section v in these discourses the evening ended and night advancing we returnd home from our walk at supper and afterwards for the rest of that night theocles said little the discourse was now managd chiefly by the two companions who turnd it upon a new sort of philosophy such as you will excuse me good palemon if i pass over with more haste miracles prodigys there was much said and with great learning on the nature of spirits and apparitions of which the most astonishing shaftesbury  0       accounts were the most ravishing with our friends who endeavourd to exceed one another in this admirable way and performd to a miracle in raising one anothers amazement nothing was so charming with them as that which was disagreeing and odd nothing so soothing as that which movd horror in short whatever was rational plain and easy bore no relish and nothing came amiss which was cross to nature out of sort and order and in no proportion or harmony with the rest of things monstrous births prodigys inchantments elementary wars and convulsions were our chief entertainment one woud have thought that in a kind of rivalship between providence and nature the latter lady was made to appear as homely as possible that her deformitys might recommend and set off the beautys of the former for to do our friends justice i must own i thought their intention to be     sincerely religious but this was not a face of religion i was like to be enamourd with it was not from hence i feard being made enthusiastick or superstitious if ever i became so i found it woud rather be after theocless manner the monuments and churchyards were not such powerful scenes with me as the mountains the plains the solemn woods and groves of whose inhabitants i chose much rather to hear than of shaftesbury  0       the other and i was readier to fansy truth in those poetical fictions which theocles made use of than in any of his friends ghastly storys so pompously set off after the usual way in a lofty tone of authority and with an assuming air of truth scepticism you may imagine palemon that my scepticism with which you so often reproach me coud not well forsake me here nor coud it fail to give disturbance to our companions especially to the grave gentleman who had clashd with me some time before he bore with me awhile till having lost all patience one must certainly said he be master of no small share of assurance to hold out against the common opinion of the world and deny things which are known by the report of the most considerable part of mankind this said i is far from being my case you have never yet heard me deny any thing tho i have questiond many if i suspend my judgment tis because i have less sufficiency than others there are people i know who have so great a regard to every fancy of their own that they can believe their very dreams but shaftesbury  0       i who coud never pay any such deference to my sleeping fancys am apt sometimes to question even my waking thoughts and examine whether these are not dreams too since men have a faculty of dreaming sometimes with their eyes open you will own tis no small pleasure with mankind to make their dreams pass for realitys and that the love of truth is in earnest not half so prevalent as this passion for novelty and surprize joind with a desire of making impression and being admird however i am so charitable still as to think     there is more of innocent delusion than voluntary imposture in the world imposture  and that they who have most imposd on mankind have been happy in a certain faculty of imposing first upon themselves by which they have a kind of salvo for their consciences and are so much the more successful as they can act their part more naturally and to the life nor is it to be esteemd a riddle that mens dreams shoud sometimes have the good fortune of passing with em for truth when we consider that in some cases that which was never so much as dreamt of or related as truth comes afterwards to be believd by one who has often told it so that the greatest impostor in the world replyd he at this rate may be allowd sincere shaftesbury  0      as to the main of his imposture said i perhaps he may notwithstanding some pious frauds made use of between whiles in behalf of a belief thought good and wholesom and so very natural do i take this to be that in all religions except the true i look upon the greatest zeal to be accompanyd with the strongest inclination to deceive for the design and end being the truth tis not customary to hesitate or be scrupulous about the choice of means whether this be true or no i appeal to the experience of the last age in which twill not be difficult to find very remarkable examples where imposture and zeal bigotry and hypocrisy have livd together in one and the same character let this be as it will replyd he i am sorry upon the whole to find you of such an incredulous temper tis just said i that you shoud pity me as a sufferer for losing that pleasure which i see others enjoy for what stronger pleasure is there with mankind or what do they earlier learn or longer retain than the love of hearing and relating things strange and incredible wonderment  how wonderful a thing is the love of wondering and of raising wonder tis the delight of children to hear tales they shiver at and shaftesbury  0       the vice of old age to abound in strange storys of times past we come into the world wondering at every thing and when our wonder about common things is over we seek something new to wonder at our last scene is to tell wonders of our own to all who     will believe em and amidst all this tis well if truth comes off but moderately tainted tis well replyd he if with this moderate faith of yours you can believe any miracles whatever no matter said i how incredulous i am of modern miracles if i have a right faith in those of former times by paying the deference due to sacred writ tis here i am so much warnd against credulity credulity  and enjoind never to believe even the greatest miracles which may be wrought in opposition to what has been already taught me and this injunction i am so well fitted to comply with that i can safely engage to keep still in the same faith and promise never to believe amiss but is this a promise which can well be made if not and that my belief indeed does not absolutely depend upon my self how am i accountable for it i may be justly shaftesbury  0       punishd for actions in which my will is free but with what justice can i be challengd for my belief if in this i am not at my liberty if credulity and incredulity are defects only in the judgment and the bestmeaning person in the world may err on either side whilst a much worse man by having better parts may judg far better of the evidence of things how can you punish him who errs unless you woud punish weakness and say tis just for men to suffer for their unhappiness and not their fault i am apt to think said he that very few of those who are punishd for their incredulity can be said to be sufferers for their weakness taking it for granted then replyd i that simplicity and weakness is more the character of the credulous than of the unbelieving yet i see not but that even this way still we are as liable to suffer by our weakness as in the contrary case by an overrefind wit for if we cannot command our own belief how are we secure against those false prophets and their deluding miracles of which we have such warning given us how are we safe from heresy and false religion credulity being that which delivers us up to all impostures of this sort and which shaftesbury  0       actually at this day hold the pagan and     mahometan world in error and blind superstition either therefore there is no punishment due to wrong belief because we cannot believe as we will ourselves or if we can why shoud we not promise never to believe amiss now in respect of miracles to come the surest way never to believe amiss is never to believe at all for being satisfyd of the truth of our religion by past miracles so as to need no other to confirm us the belief of new may often do us harm but can never do us good therefore as the truest mark of a believing christian is to seek after no sign or miracle to come so the safest station in christianity is his who can be movd by nothing of this kind and is thus miracleproof for if the miracle be on the side of his faith tis superfluous and he needs it not if against his faith let it be as great as possible he will never regard it in the least or believe it any other than imposture tho coming from an angel so that with all that incredulity for which you reproach me so severely i take myself to be still the better and more orthodox christian at least i am more sure of continuing so than you who with your credulity may be imposd upon by such as are far short of angels for having this preparatory disposition tis odds you may come in time to believe mi shaftesbury  0      racles in any of the different sects who we know all pretend to them i am persuaded therefore that the best maxim to go by is that common one that miracles are ceasd and i am ready to defend this opinion of mine to be the most probable in itself as well as most sutable to christianity this question upon further debate happend to divide our two companions for the elderly gentleman my antagonist maintaind that the giving up of miracles for the time present woud be of great advantage to the atheists the younger gentleman his companion questiond whether the allowing em might not be of as great advantage to the enthusiasts and sectarys against the national church this of the two being the greatest danger he thought both to religion and the state he was resolvd therefore for the future to be as cautious in examining these modern miracles as he had before been eager in seeking em he told us     very pleasantly what an adventurer he had been of that kind and on how many partys he had been engagd with a sort of people who were always on the hot scent of some new prodigy or apparition some upstart revelation or prophecy this he thought shaftesbury  0    0  was true fanaticism errant fanaticism  he had enough of this visionary chace and woud ramble no more in blind corners of the world as he had been formerly accustomd in ghostly company of spirithunters witchfinders and layersout for hellish storys and diabolical transactions there was no need he thought of such intelligences from hell to prove the power of heaven and being of a god and now at last he begun to see the ridicule of laying such a stress on these matters as if a providence depended on them and religion were at stake when any of these wild feats were questiond he was sensible there were many good christians who made themselves strong partisans in this cause tho he coud not avoid wondring at it now he began to consider and look back the heathens he said who wanted scripture might have recourse to miracles and providence perhaps had allowd them their oracles and prodigys as an imperfect kind of revelation the jews too for their hard heart and harder understanding had this allowance when stubbornly they askd for signs and wonders but christians for their parts had a far better and truer revelation they had their plainer oracles a more rational law and clearer scripture carrying its own force and withal so shaftesbury  0       well attested as to admit of no dispute and were i continud he to assign the exact time when miracles probably might first have ceasd i shoud be tempted to fansy it was when sacred writ took place and was compleated miracles past present this is fancy indeed replyd the grave gentleman and a very dangerous one to that scripture you pretend is of itself so well attested the attestation of men dead and gone in behalf of miracles past and at an end can never surely be of equal force with miracles present and of these i maintain there are never wanting a number sufficient in the world to warrant a divine existence if there were no miracles nowadays the world woud be     apt to think there never were any the present must answer for the credibility of the past this is god witnessing for himself human testimony  not men for god for who shall witness for men if in the case of religion they have no testimony from heaven in their behalf what it is may make the report of men credible said the younger gentleman is another question but for mere miracles it seems to me they cannot be properly said to witness either for god or men for who shall witness for the miracles themselves and what shaftesbury  0       tho they are ever so certain what security have we that they are not acted by daemons what proof that they are not wrought by magick in short what trust is there to any thing above or below if the signs are only of power and not of goodness and are you so far improvd then replyd the severe companion under your new sceptical master pointing to me that you can thus readily discard all miracles as useless— the young gentleman i saw was somewhat daunted with this rough usage of his friend who was going on still with his invective nay then said i interposing tis i who am to answer for this young gentleman whom you make to be my disciple and since his modesty i see will not allow him to pursue what he has so handsomly begun i will endeavour it myself if he will give me leave the young gentleman assented and i went on representing his fair intention of establishing in the first place a rational and just foundation for our faith so as to vindicate it from the reproach of having no immediate miracles to support it he woud have done this i said un shaftesbury  0      doubtedly by shewing how good proof we had already for our sacred oracles from the testimony of the dead whose characters and lives might answer for them as to the truth of what they reported to us from god this however was by no means witnessing for god as the zealous gentleman had hastily expressd himself for this was above the reach either of men or miracles nor coud god witness for himself or assert his being any other way to men divine testimony  than by revealing himself to their     reason appealing to their judgment and submitting his ways to their censure and cool deliberation the contemplation of the universe its laws and government was i averd the only means which coud establish the sound belief of a deity for what tho innumerable miracles from every part assaild the sense and gave the trembling soul no respite miracles no proof of divinity  what tho the sky shoud suddenly open and all kinds of prodigys appear voices be heard or characters read what woud this evince more than that there were certain powers coud do all this but what powers whether one or more whether superior or subaltern mortal or immortal wise or foolish just or unjust good or bad this woud still remain a mystery as woud the true intention the infallibility or cer shaftesbury  0      tainty of whatever these powers asserted their word coud not be taken in their own case they might silence men indeed but not convince them since power can never serve as proof for goodness and goodness is the only pledg of truth by goodness alone trust is created by goodness superior powers may win belief they must allow their works to be examind their actions criticizd and thus thus only they may be confided in when by repeated marks their benevolence is provd and their character of sincerity and truth establishd to whom therefore the laws of this universe and its government appear just and uniform to him they speak the government of one justone to him they reveal and witness a god and laying in him the foundation of this first faith they fit him for a †subsequent one revelation  he can then hearken to historical revelation and is then fitted and not till then for the reception of any message or miraculous notice from above where he knows beforehand all is just and true but this no power of miracles nor any power besides his reason can make him know or apprehend shaftesbury  0      but now continud i since i have been thus long the defendent only i am resolvd to take up offensive arms and be aggressor in     my turn provided theocles be not angry with me for borrowing ground from his hypothesis whatever you borrow of his replyd my antagonist you are pretty sure of spoiling it and as it passes thro your hands you had best beware lest you seem rather to reflect on him than me ill venture it said i whilst i maintain that most of those maxims you build upon are fit only to betray your own cause for whilst you are labouring to unhinge nature whilst you are searching heaven and earth for prodigys atheism from superstition  and studying how to miraculize every thing you bring confusion on the world you break its uniformity and destroy that admirable simplicity of order from whence the one infinite and perfect principle is known perpetual strifes convulsions violences breach of laws variation and unsteddiness of order shew either no controul or several uncontrould and unsubordinate powers in nature we have before our eyes either the chaos and atoms of the atheists or the magick and shaftesbury  0       daemons of the polytheists yet is this tumultuous system of the universe asserted with the highest zeal by some who woud maintain a deity this is that face of things and these the features by which they represent divinity hither the eyes of our more inquisitive and ingenuous youth are turnd with care lest they see any thing otherwise than in this perplexd and amazing view as if atheism were the most natural inference which coud be drawn from a regular and orderly state of things but after all this mangling and disfigurement of nature if it happens as oft it does that the amazd disciple coming to himself and searching leisurely into natures ways finds more of order uniformity and constancy in things than he suspected he is of course driven into atheism and this merely by the impressions he receivd from that preposterous system which taught him to seek for deity in confusion and to discover providence in an irregular disjointed world and when you replyd he with your newlyespousd system have brought all things to be as uniform plain regular and simple as you coud wish i suppose you will send your disciple to seek for deity in mechanism that is to say in some exquisite system   0 of selfgovernd matter shaftesbury  0       for what else is it you naturalists make of the world than a mere machine nothing else replyd i if to the machine you allow a mind for in this case tis not a selfgovernd but a godgovernd machine and what are the tokens said he which shoud convince us what signs shoud this dumb machine give of its being thus governd the present replyd i are sufficient it cannot possibly give stronger signs of life and steddy thought compare our own machines with this greatone and see whether by their order management and motions they betoken either so perfect a life or so consummate an intelligence the one is regular steddy permanent the other are irregular variable inconstant in one there are the marks of wisdom and determination in the other of whimsy and conceit in one there appears judgment in the other fancy only in one will in the other caprice in one truth certainty knowledg in the other error folly and madness—but to be convincd there is something above which thinks and acts we want it seems the latter of these signs as supposing there can be no shaftesbury  0       thought or intelligence beside what is like our own we sicken and grow weary with the orderly and regular course of things periods and stated laws and revolutions just and proportionable work not upon us nor win our admiration we must have riddles prodigys matter for surprize and horror by harmony order and concord we are made atheists by irregularity and discord we are convincd of deity the world is mere accident if it proceeds in course but an effect of wisdom if it runs mad thus i took upon me the part of a sound theist whilst i endeavourd to refute my antagonist and shew that his principles favourd atheism the zealous gentleman took high offence and we continud debating warmly till late at night but theocles was moderator and we retird at last to our repose all calm and friendly however i was not a little rejoicd to hear that our companions were to go away early the next morning and leave theocles to me alone     for now palemon that morning was approaching sect    for which i so much longd what your longing may prove shaftesbury  0       i may have reason to fear you have had enough one woud think to turn the edge of your curiosity in this kind can it be imagind that after the recital of two such days already past you can with patience hear of another yet to come more philosophical than either—but you have made me promise and now whateer it cost take it you must as follows shaftesbury  0    0 part iii philocles to palemon sect   section i it was yet deep night as i imagind when i wakd with the noise of people up in the house i calld to know the matter and was told that theocles had a little before parted with his friends after which he went out to take his morningwalk but woud return they thought pretty soon for so he had left word and that nobody in the mean time shoud disturb my rest this was disturbance sufficient when i heard it i presently got up and finding it light enough to see the hill which was at a little distance from the house i soon got thither and at the foot of it overtook theocles to whom i complaind of his unkindness for i was not certainly i told him so effeminate and weak a friend as to deserve that he shoud shaftesbury  0       treat me like a woman nor had i shown such an aversion to his manners or conversation as to be thought fitter for the dull luxury of a soft bed and ease than for business recreation or study with an early friend he had no other way therefore of making me amends than by allowing me henceforward to be a party with him in his serious thoughts as he saw i was resolvd to be in his hours and exercises of this sort you have forgot then said theocles the assignation you had yesterday with the silvan nymphs at this place and hour     no truly said i for as you see i am come punctually to the place appointed but i never expected you shoud have come hither without me nay then said theocles theres hope you may in time become a lover with me for you already begin to shew jealousy how little did i think these nymphs coud raise that passion in you truly said i for the nymphs you mention i know little of em as yet my jealousy and love regard you only i was afraid you had a mind to escape me but now that i am again in possession of you i want no nymph to make me happy here unless it were perhaps to join forces against you in the manner your belovd poet makes the nymph aegle shaftesbury  0       join with his two youths in forcing the god silenus to sing to em i dare trust your gallantry replyd theocles that if you had such fair company as you speak of you woud otherwise bestow your time than in an adventure of philosophy—but do you expect i shoud imitate the poets god you mentiond and sing the rise of things from atoms the birth of order from confusion and the origin of union harmony and concord from the sole powers of chaos and blind chance the song indeed was fitted to the god for what coud better sute his jolly character than such a drunken creation which he lovd often to celebrate by acting it to the life but even this song was too harmonious for the nights debauch well has our poet made it of the morning when the god was fresh for hardly shoud we be brought ever to believe that such harmonious numbers coud arise from a mere chaos of the mind but we must hear our poet speaking in the mouth of some soberer demigod or hero he then presents us with a different principle of things and in a more proper order of precedency gives thought the upper hand he makes mind originally to have governd body not body mind for this shaftesbury  0       had been a chaos everlasting and must have kept all things in a chaosstate to this day and for ever had it ever been but   the active mind infusd thro all the space   unites and mingles with the mighty mass   hence men and beasts—     here philocles we shall find our sovereign genius if we can charm the genius of the place more chaste and sober than your silenus to inspire us with a truer song of nature teach us some celestial hymn and make us feel divinity present in these solemn places of retreat haste then i conjure you said i good theocles and stop not one moment for any ceremony or rite for well i see methinks that without any such preparation some divinity has approachd us and already moves in you we are come to the sacred groves of the hamadryads which formerly were said to render oracles we are on the most beautiful part of the hill and the sun now ready to rise draws off the curtain of night and shews us the open scene of nature in the plains below begin for now i know you are full of those di shaftesbury  0      vine thoughts which meet you ever in this solitude give em but voice and accents you may be still as much alone as you are usd and take no more notice of me than if i were absent just as i had said this he turnd away his eyes from me musing awhile by himself and soon afterwards stretching out his hand as pointing to the objects round him he began meditation ye fields and woods my refuge from the toilsome world of business receive me in your quiet sanctuarys and favour my retreat and thoughtful solitude—ye verdant plains how gladly i salute ye—hail all ye blissful mansions known seats delightful prospects majestick beautys of this earth and all ye rural powers and graces—blessd be ye chaste abodes of happiest mortals who here in peaceful innocence enjoy a life unenvyd tho divine whilst with its blessd tranquillity it affords a happy leisure and retreat for man who made for contemplation and to search his own and other natures may here best meditate the cause of things and placd amidst the various scenes of nature may nearer view her works shaftesbury  0      o glorious nature supremely fair and sovereignly good allloving and alllovely alldivine whose looks are so becoming and of such infinite grace whose study brings such wisdom and     whose contemplation such delight whose every single work affords an ampler scene and is a nobler spectacle than all which ever art presented—o mighty nature wise substitute of providence impowerd creatress or thou impowering deity supreme creator thee i invoke and thee alone adore to thee this solitude this place these rural meditations are sacred whilst thus inspird with harmony of thought tho unconfind by words and in loose numbers i sing of natures order in created beings and celebrate the beautys which resolve in thee the source and principle of all beauty and perfection thy being is boundless unsearchable impenetrable in thy immensity all thought is lost fancy gives oer its flight and wearyd imagination spends itself in vain finding no coast nor limit of this ocean nor in the widest tract thro which it soars one point yet nearer the circumference than the shaftesbury  0       first center whence it parted—thus having oft essayd thus sallyd forth into the wide expanse when i return again within myself struck with the sense of this so narrow being and of the fulness of that immenseone i dare no more behold the amazing depths nor sound the abyss of deity— yet since by thee o sovereign mind i have been formd such as i am intelligent and rational since the peculiar dignity of my nature is to know and contemplate thee permit that with due freedom i exert those facultys with which thou hast adornd me bear with my ventrous and bold approach and since nor vain curiosity nor fond conceit nor love of ought save thee alone inspires me with such thoughts as these be thou my assistant and guide me in this pursuit whilst i venture thus to tread the labyrinth of wide nature and endeavour to trace thee in thy works— here he stopd short and starting as out of a dream now philocles said he inform me how have i appeard to you in my fit seemd it a sensible kind of madness like those trans shaftesbury  0      ports which are permitted to our poets or was it downright raving     i only wish said i that you had been a little stronger in your transport to have proceeded as you began without ever minding me for i was beginning to see wonders in that nature you taught me and was coming to know the hand of your divine artificer but if you stop here i shall lose the enjoyment of the pleasing vision and already i begin to find a thousand difficultys in fansying such a universal genius as you describe unity why said he is there any difficulty in fansying the universe to be one intire thing can one otherwise think of it by what is visible than that all hangs together as of a piece grant it and what follows only this that if it may indeed be said of the world that it is simply one there shoud be something belonging to it which makes it one as how no otherwise than as you may observe in every thing for to instance in what we see before us i know you look upon the trees of this vast wood to be different from one another and this tall oak the noblest of the company as it is by itself a different thing from all its fellows of the wood so with its own wood of numerous spread shaftesbury  0      ing branches which seem so many different trees tis still i suppose one and the selfsame tree now shoud you as a mere caviller and not as a fair sceptick tell me that if a figure of wax or any other matter were cast in the exact shape and colours of this tree and temperd if possible to the same kind of substance it might therefore possibly be a real tree of the same kind or species i woud have done with you and reason no longer but if you questiond me fairly and desird i shoud satisfy you what i thought it was which made this oneness or sameness in the tree or any other plant or by what it differd from the waxen figure or from any such figure accidentally made either in the clouds or on the sand by the seashore i shoud tell you that neither the wax nor sand nor cloud thus piecd together by our hand or fancy had any real relation within themselves or had any nature by which they corresponded any more in that near situation of parts than if scatterd ever so far asunder but this i shoud affirm that wherever there was such a sympathizing of parts as we saw here in our real     tree wherever there was such a plain concurrence in one common end and to the support nourishment and propagation of so fair a form we coud not be mistaken in saying there was a peculiar shaftesbury  0       nature belonging to this form and common to it with others of the same kind by virtue of this our tree is a real tree lives flourishes and is still one and the same even when by vegetation and change of substance not one particle in it remains the same at this rate indeed said i you have found a way to make very adorable places of these silvan habitations for besides the living genius of each place the woods too which by your account are animated have their hamadryads no doubt and the springs and rivulets their nymphs in store belonging to em and these too by what i can apprehend of immaterial and immortal substances we injure em then replyd theocles to say they belong to these trees and not rather these trees to them but as for their immortality let them look to it themselves i only know that both theirs and all other natures must for their duration depend alone on that nature on which the world depends and that every genius else must be subordinate to that one good genius whom i woud willingly persuade you to think belonging to this world according to our present way of speaking shaftesbury  0    0 leaving therefore these trees continud he to personate themselves the best they can personality  let us examine this thing of personality between you and me and consider how you philocles are you and im myself for that there is a sympathy of parts in these figures of ours self  other than in those of marble formd by a phidias or praxiteles sense i believe will teach us and yet that our own marble or stuff whateer it be of which we are composd wears out in seven or at the longest in twice seven years the meanest anatomist can tell us now where i beseech you will that same one be found at last supposing it to lie in the stuff itself or any part of it for when that is wholly spent and not one particle of it left we are ourselves still as much as before what you philosophers are replyd i may be hard perhaps to determine but for the rest of mankind i dare affirm that few     are so long themselves as half seven years tis good fortune if a man be one and the same only for a day or two a year makes more revolutions than can be numberd true said he but tho this may happen to a man and chiefly to one whose shaftesbury  0       contrary vices set him at odds so often with himself yet when he comes to suffer or be punishd for those vices he finds himself if i mistake not still one and the same and you philocles who tho you disown philosophy are yet so true a proselyte to pyrrhonism shoud you at last feeling the power of the genius i preach be wrought upon to own the divine hypothesis identity  and from this new turn of thought admit a total change in all your principles and opinions yet woud you be still the selfsame philocles tho better yet if you will take my judgment than the presentone as much as i love and value him you see therefore there is a strange simplicity in this you and me that in reality they shoud be still one and the same when neither one atom of body one passion nor one thought remains the same and for that poor endeavour of making out this sameness or identity of being from some selfsame matter or particle of matter matter  supposd to remain with us when all besides is changd this is by so much the more contemptible as that matter itself is not really capable of such simplicity for i dare answer you will allow this you and me to be each of us simply and individually one better than you can allow the same to any thing of mere matter unless quitting your inclination for scep shaftesbury  0      ticism you fall so in love with the notion of an atom as to find it full as intelligible and certain to you as that you are yourself but whatever continud theocles be supposd of uncompounded matter a thing at best pretty difficult to conceive yet being compounded form  and put together in a certain number of such parts as unite and conspire in these frames of ours and others like them if it can present us with so many innumerable instances of particular forms who share this simple principle by which they are really one live act and have a nature or genius peculiar to themselves a genius  and provident for their own welfare how shall we at     the same time overlook this in the whole and deny the great and generalone of the world how can we be so unnatural as to disown divine nature the supreme one  our common parent and refuse to recognize the universal and sovereign genius sovereigns said i require no notice to be taken of em when they pass incognito nor any homage where they appear not in due form we may even have reason to presume they shoud be displeasd with us for being too officious in endeavouring to discover them when they keep themselves either wholly invisible or shaftesbury  0       in very dark disguise as for the notice we take of these invisible powers in the common way of our religion we have our visible sovereigns to answer for us our lawful superiors teach us what we are to own and to perform in worship and we are dutiful in complying with them and following their example but in a philosophical way i find no warrant for our being such earnest recognizers of a controverted title however it be you must allow one at least to understand the controversy and know the nature of these powers describd may one not inquire what substances they are of substance material immaterial  whether material or immaterial may one not on the other hand replyd theocles inquire as well what substance or which of these two substances you count your real and proper self or woud you rather be no substance but chuse to call yourself a mode or accident truly said i as accidental as my life may be or as that random humour is which governs it i know nothing after all so real or substantial as myself therefore if there be that thing you call a substance i take for granted i am one but for any thing further relating to this question you know my shaftesbury  0       sceptick principles i determine neither way allow me then replyd he good philocles the same privilege of scepticism in this respect since it concerns not the affair before us which way we determine or whether we come to any determination at all in this point for be the difficulty ever so great it stands the same you may perceive against your own being as against that which i am pretending to convince you of you     may raise what objections you please on either hand and your dilemma may be of notable force against the manner of such a supreme beings existence but after you have done all you will bring the same dilemma home to you and be at a loss still about yourself metaphysicks  when you have argud ever so long upon these metaphysical points of mode and substance and have philosophically concluded from the difficultys of each hypothesis that there cannot be in nature such a universalone as this you must conclude a mind  from the same reasons that there cannot be any such particular one as yourself but that there is actually such a one as this latter your own mind tis hopd may satisfy you and of this mind tis enough to say that it is something which acts upon a body and has shaftesbury  0       something passive under it and subject to it that it has not only body or mere matter for its subject but in some respect even itself too and what proceeds from it that it superintends and manages its own imaginations appearances fancys correcting working and modelling these as it finds good and adorning and accomplishing the best it can this composite order of body and understanding such a mind and governing part i know there is somewhere in the world let pyrrho by the help of such another contradict me if he pleases we have our several understandings and thoughts particular minds  however we came by em each understands and thinks the best he can for his own purpose he for himself i for another self and who i beseech you for the whole—noone nothing at all—the world perhaps mind of the whole  you suppose to be mere body a mass of modifyd matter the bodys of men are part therefore of this body the imaginations sensations apprehensions of men are included in this body and inherent in it producd out of it and resumd again into it tho the body it seems never dreams of it the world itself is never the wiser for all the wit and wisdom it breeds it has no apprehension at all of what is doing no thought kept to itself for its own shaftesbury  0       proper use or purpose not a single imagination or reflection by which to discover or be conscious of the manifold imaginations and inventions which it sets afoot and deals abroad with such an open hand the  00 goodly bulk so prolifick kind and yielding for everyone else has nothing left at last for its own share having unhappily lavishd all away—by what chance i woud fain understand how or by what necessity—who gives the law—who orders and distributes thus nature say you nature  and what is nature is it sense is it a person has she reason or understanding no who then understands for her or is interested or concernd in her behalf noone not a soul but every one for himself come on then let us hear further is not this nature still a self or tell me i beseech you how are you one by what token or by virtue of what by a principle which joins certain parts and which thinks and acts consonantly for the use and purpose of those parts say therefore what is your whole system a part of or is it indeed no part but a whole by itself absolute independent and unrelated to any thing besides if it be indeed a part and really related to what else i shaftesbury  0       beseech you than to the whole of nature is there then such a uniting principle in nature if so nature subject to a mind  how are you then a self and nature not so how have you something to understand and act for you and nature who gave this understanding nothing at all to understand for her advise her or help her out poor being on any occasion whatever necessity she may be in has the world such ill fortune in the main are there so many particular understanding active principles every where and is there nothing at last which thinks acts or understands for all nothing which administers or looks after all contrary belief no says one of a modern hypothesis for the world was from eternity as you see it and is no more than barely what you see matter modifyd a lump in motion with here and there a thought or scatterd portion of dissoluble intelligence—no says one of an antienter hypothesis for the world was once without any intelligence or thought at all mere matter chaos two sorts  and a play of atoms till thought by chance came into play and made up a harmony which was never designd or thought of—admirable conceit—believe it who can faith of atheism  for my own share thank providence  0  i have a mind in my shaftesbury  0       possession which serves such as it is to keep my body and its affections my passions appetites imaginations fancys and the rest in tolerable harmony and order but the order of the universe i am persuaded still is much the better of the two let epicurus if he please think his the better and believing no genius or wisdom above his own inform us by what chance twas dealt him and how atoms came to be so wise in fine continud theocles raising his voice and action being thus even by scepticism itself convincd the more still of my own being and of this self of mine faith of theism  that tis a real self drawn out and copyd from another principal and original self the greatone of the world i endeavour to be really one with it and conformable to it as far as i am able i consider that as there is one general mass one body of the whole so to this body there is an order to this order a mind that to this general mind each particularone must have relation as being of like substance as much as we can understand of substance alike active upon body original to motion and order alike simple uncompounded individual of like energy effect and operation and more like still if it cooperates with it to general good and strives to will shaftesbury  0       according to the best of wills so that it cannot surely but seem natural that the particular mind shoud seek its happiness in conformity with the generalone and endeavour to resemble it in its highest simplicity and excellence therefore now said i good theocles be once again the enthusiast and let me hear anew that divine song with which i was lately charmd i am already got over my qualm and begin better than ever to fansy such a nature as you speak of insomuch that i find myself mightily in its interest and concernd that all shoud go happily and well with it tho at the rate it often runs i can scarce help being in some pain on its account energy of nature fear not my friend replyd he for know that every particular nature certainly and constantly produces what is good to itself unless something foreign disturbs or hinders it either by  0  overpowering and corrupting it within or by violence from without thus nature in the patient struggles to the last and strives to throw off the distemper thus even in these plants we see round us every shaftesbury  0    0  particular nature thrives and attains its perfection if nothing from without obstructs it nor any thing foreign has already impaird or wounded it and even in this case it does its utmost still to redeem itself what are all weaknesses distempers  distortions sicknesses imperfect births and the seeming contradictions and perversitys of nature other than of this sort and how ignorant must one be of all natural causes and operations to think that any of these disorders happen by a miscarriage of the particular nature and not by the force of some foreign nature which overpowers it if therefore every particular nature be thus constantly and unerringly true to itself and certain to produce only what is good for itself and conducing to its own right state shall not the generalone the nature of the whole do full as much shall that alone miscarry or fail or is there any thing foreign which shoud at any time do violence upon it or force it out of its natural way if not general good  then all it produces is to its own advantage and good the good of all in general and what is for the good of all in general is just and good  tis so said i i confess then you ought to rest satisfyd replyd he and not only so but be pleasd shaftesbury  0       and rejoice at what happens knowing whence it comes and to what perfection it contributes resignation bless me said i theocles into what a superstition are you like to lead me i thought it heretofore the mark of a superstitious mind to search for providence in the common accidents of life and ascribe to the divine power those common disasters and calamitys which nature has entaild on mankind but now i find i must place all in general to one account and viewing things thro a kind of magical glass i am to see the worst of ills transformd to good and admire equally whatever comes from one and the same perfect hand—but no matter i can surmount all go on theocles and let me advise you in my own behalf that since  0  you have rekindled me you do not by delaying give me time to cool again i woud have you know replyd he i scorn to take the advantage of a warm fit and be beholden to temper or imagination for gaining me your assent therefore ere i go yet a step farther i am resolvd to enter again into cool reason with you and ask if you admit for proof what i advancd yesterday upon shaftesbury  0       that head of a universal union principle of order  coherence or sympathizing of things by force of probability said i you overcame me being convincd of a consent and correspondence in all we saw of things i considerd it as unreasonable not to allow the same throout unreasonable indeed replyd he for in the infinite residue were there no principle of union it woud seem next to impossible that things within our sphere shoud be consistent and keep their order why universal  for what was infinite woud be predominant it seems so tell me then said he after this union ownd how you can refuse to allow the name of demonstration to the remaining arguments which establish the government of a perfect mind phaenomena of ill your solutions said i of the ill appearances are not perfect enough to pass for demonstration and whatever seems vitious or imperfect in the creation puts a stop to further conclusions till the thing be solvd did you not then said he agree with me when i averd that the appearances shaftesbury  0       must of necessity stand as they are and things seem altogether as imperfect even on the concession of a perfect supreme mind existent i did so and is not the same reason good still viz that in an infinity of things mutually relative a mind which sees not infinitely can see nothing fully whence  and must therefore frequently see that as imperfect which in itself is really perfect  the reason is still good are the appearances then any objection to our hypothesis none whilst they remain appearances only can you then prove them to be any more for if you cannot you prove nothing and that it lies on you to prove you plainly see  0  since the appearances do not only agree with the hypothesis but are a necessary consequence from it to bid me prove therefore in this case is in a manner the same as to bid me be infinite for nothing beside what is infinite can see infinite connexions the presumption i must confess said i by this reckoning is wholly on your side yet still this is only presumption shaftesbury  0      demonstration take demonstration then said he if you can endure i shoud reason thus abstractedly and drily the appearances of ill you say are not necessarily that ill they represent to you i own it therefore what they represent may possibly be good it may and therefore there may possibly be no real ill in things but all may be perfectly concurrent to one interest the interest of that universal one it may be so why then if it may be so be not surprizd it follows that it must be so on the account of that great unit and simple selfprinciple which you have granted in the whole for whatever is possible in the whole the nature or mind of the whole will put in execution for the wholes good and if it be possible to exclude ill it will exclude it therefore since notwithstanding the appearances tis possible that ill may actually be excluded count upon it that actually it is excluded for nothing merely passive can oppose this universally active principle if any thing shaftesbury  0       active oppose it tis another principle allow it manichaeism tis impossible for were there in nature two or more principles either they must agree or not if they agree not all must be confusion till one be predominant if they agree there must be some natural reason for their agreement and this natural reason cannot be from chance but from some particular design contrivance or thought which brings us up again to one principle and makes the other two to be subordinate and thus when we have compard each of the three opinions viz that there is no designing active principle conclusion  that there is more than one or that finally there is but one we shall perceive that the only consistent opinion is the last and since one or other of these opinions must of  0  necessity be true what can we determine other than that the last is and must be so demonstrably if it be demonstration that in three opinions one of which must necessarily be true two being plainly absurd the third must be the truth enough said i theocles my doubts are vanishd malice and chance vain phantoms have yielded to that allprevalent wisdom which you shaftesbury  0       have establishd you are conqueror in the cool way of reason and may with honour now grow warm again in your poetick vein return therefore i intreat you once more to that perfection of being and address yourself to it as before on our approaches to these silvan scenes where first it seemd to inspire you i shall now no longer be in danger of imagining either magick or superstition in the case since you invoke no other power than that single one which seems so natural thus i continue then said theocles addressing myself as you woud have me to that guardiandeity and inspirer whom we are to imagine present here meditation  but not here only for o mighty genius soleanimating and inspiring power author and subject of these thoughts thy influence is universal and in all things thou art inmost from thee depend their secret springs of action thou movst them with an irresistible unwearyd force by sacred and inviolable laws framd for the good of each particular being as best may sute with the perfection life and vigour of the whole the vital principle is widely shard and infinitely varyd dispersd throout no shaftesbury  0      where extinct all lives and by succession still revives the temporary beings quit their borrowd forms and yield their elementary substance to newcomers calld in their several turns to life they view the light and viewing pass that others too may be spectators of the goodly scene and greater numbers still enjoy the privilege of nature munificent and great she imparts herself to most and makes the subjects of her bounty infinite nought stays her hastning hand no time nor substance is lost or unimprovd new forms arise and when the old dissolve the matter whence they were composd is not left useless  0  but wrought with equal management and art even in corruption natures seeming waste and vile abhorrence the abject state appears merely as the way or passage to some better but coud we nearly view it and with indifference remote from the antipathy of sense we then perhaps shoud highest raise our admiration convincd that even the way itself was equal to the end nor can we judg less favourably of that consummate art exhibited thro all the works of nature since our weak eyes helpd by mechanick art discover in these works a hidden scene of wonders worlds within worlds shaftesbury  0       of infinite minuteness tho as to art still equal to the greatest and pregnant with more wonders than the most discerning sense joind with the greatest art or the acutest reason can penetrate or unfold but tis in vain for us to search the bulky mass of matter seeking to know its nature how great the whole itself or even how small its parts if knowing only some of the rules of motion we seek to trace it further tis in vain we follow it into the bodys it has reachd our tardy apprehensions fail us and can reach nothing beyond the body itself thro which it is diffusd wonderful being if we may call it so which bodys never receive except from others which lose it nor ever lose unless by imparting it to others even without change of place it has its force and bodys big with motion labour to move yet stir not whilst they express an energy beyond our comprehension in vain too we pursue that phantom time too small and yet too mighty for our grasp when shrinking to a narrow point it scapes our hold or mocks our scanty thought by swelling shaftesbury  0       to eternity an object unproportiond to our capacity as is thy being o thou antient cause older than time yet young with fresh eternity in vain we try to fathom the abyss of space the seat of thy extensive being of which no place is empty no void which is not full in vain we labour to understand that principle of sense and  0  thought which seeming in us to depend so much on motion yet differs so much from it and from matter itself as not to suffer us to conceive how thought can more result from this than this arise from thought but thought we own preeminent and confess the reallest of beings the only existence of which we are made sure by being conscious all else may be only dream and shadow all which even sense suggests may be deceitful the sense itself remains still reason subsists and thought maintains its eldership of being thus are we in a manner conscious of that original and eternally existent thought whence we derive our own and thus the assurance we have of the existence of beings above our sense and of thee the great exemplar of thy works comes from shaftesbury  0    0  thee the alltrue and perfect who hast thus communicated thyself more immediately to us so as in some manner to inhabit within our souls thou who art original soul diffusive vital in all inspiriting the whole all natures wonders serve to excite and perfect this idea of their author tis here he suffers us to see and even converse with him in a manner sutable to our frailty how glorious is it to contemplate him in this noblest of his works apparent to us the system of the bigger world— here i must own twas no small comfort to me to find that as our meditation turnd we were likely to get clear of an entangling abstruse philosophy i was in hopes theocles as he proceeded might stick closer to nature since he was now come upon the borders of our world and here i woud willingly have welcomd him had i thought it safe at present to venture the least interruption besides the neighbouring planets continud he in his rapturous strain what multitudes of fixd stars did we see sparkle not an hour ago in the clear night which yet had hardly shaftesbury  0       yielded to the day how many others are discoverd by the help of art yet how many remain still beyond the reach of our discovery crouded as they seem their distance from each other is as unmeasurable by art as is the distance between them and us whence we  0  are naturally taught the immensity of that being who thro these immense spaces has disposd such an infinite of bodys belonging each as we may well presume to systems as compleat as our own world since even the smallest spark of this bright galaxy may vie with this our sun which shining now full out gives us new life exalts our spirits and makes us feel divinity more present prodigious orb bright source of vital heat and spring of day—soft flame yet how intense how active how diffusive and how vast a substance yet how collected thus within itself and in a glowing mass confind to the center of this planetary world—mighty being brightest image and representative of the almighty supreme of the corporeal world unperishing in grace and of undecaying youth fair beautiful and hardly mortal creature by what secret ways dost thou receive the sup shaftesbury  0      plies which maintain thee still in such unwearyd vigour and unexhausted glory notwithstanding those eternally emitted streams and that continual expence of vital treasures which inlighten and invigorate the surrounding winds— around him all the planets with this our earth single or with attendants continually move seeking to receive the blessing of his light and lively warmth towards him they seem to tend with prone descent as to their center but happily contrould still by another impulse they keep their heavenly order and in just numbers and exactest measure go the eternal rounds but o thou who art the author and modifier of these various motions o sovereign and sole mover by whose high art the rolling spheres are governd and these stupendous bodys of our world hold their unrelenting courses o wise oeconomist and powerful chief whom all the elements and powers of nature serve how hast thou animated these moving worlds what spirit or soul infusd what biass fixd or how encompassd them in liquid aether driving them as with shaftesbury  0       the breath of living winds thy active and unwearyd ministers in this intricate and mighty work thus powerfully are the systems held intire and kept from fatal interfering thus is our ponderous globe directed in its annual  0  course daily revolving on its own center whilst the obsequious moon with double labour monthly surrounding this our bigger orb attends the motion of her sisterplanet and pays in common her circular homage to the sun yet is this mansionglobe this mancontainer of a much narrower compass even than other its fellowwanderers of our system how narrow then must it appear compard with the capacious system of its own sun and how narrow or as nothing in respect of those innumerable systems of other apparent suns yet how immense a body it seems compard with ours of human form a borrowd remnant of its variable and oftconverted surface tho animated with a sublime celestial spirit by which we have relation and tendency to thee our heavenly sire center of souls to whom these spirits of ours by nature tend as earthly bodys to their proper center— shaftesbury  0      o did they tend as unerringly and constantly—but thou alone composest the disorders of the corporeal world and from the restless and fighting elements raisest that peaceful concord and conspiring beauty of the everflourishing creation even so canst thou convert these jarring motions of intelligent beings and in due time and manner cause them to find their rest making them contribute to the good and perfection of the universe thy allgood and perfect work— here again he broke off looking on me as if he expected i shoud speak which when he found plainly i woud not but continud still in a posture of musing thought why philocles said he with an air of wonder what can this mean that you shoud suffer me thus to run on without the least interruption have you at once given over your scrupulous philosophy to let me range thus at pleasure thro these aerial spaces and imaginary regions where my capricious fancy or easy faith has led me i woud have you to consider better and know my philocles that i had never trusted myself with you in this vein of enthusiasm had i not relyd on you to govern it a little better shaftesbury  0      i find then said i rouzing myself from my musing posture   0 you expect i shoud serve you in the same capacity as that musician whom an antient orator made use of at his elbow to strike such moving notes as raisd him when he was perceivd to sink and calmd him again when his impetuous spirit was transported in too high a strain you imagine right replyd theocles and therefore i am resolvd not to go on till you have promisd to pull me by the sleeve when i grow extravagant be it so said i you have my promise but how if instead of rising in my transports i shoud grow flat and tiresom what lyre or instrument woud you imploy to raise me the danger i told him coud hardly be supposd to lie on this hand his vein was a plentiful one and his enthusiasm in no likelihood of failing him his subject too as well as his numbers woud bear him out and with the advantage of the rural scene around us his numberd prose i thought supplyd the room of the best pastoral song for in the manner i was now wrought up twas as agreeable to me to hear him in this kind of passion invoke his stars and elements as shaftesbury  0       to hear one of those amorous shepherds complaining to his flock and making the woods and rocks resound the name of her whom he adord—begin therefore continud i still pressing him begin anew and lead me boldly thro your elements wherever there is danger be it on either hand i promise to give you warning when i perceive it let us begin then said he with this our element of earth which yonder we see cultivated with such care by the early swains now working in the plain below—unhappy restless men who first disdaind these peaceful labours gentle rural tasks performd with such delight what pride or what ambition bred this scorn hence all those fatal evils of your race enormous luxury despising homely fare ranges thro seas and lands rifles the globe and men ingenious to their misery work out for themselves the means of heavier labour anxious cares and sorrow not satisfyd to turn and manure for their use the wholesom and beneficial mould     of this their earth they dig yet deeper and seeking out imaginary wealth they search its very entrails shaftesbury  0      here led by curiosity we find minerals of different natures which by their simplicity discover no less of the divine art than the most compounded of natures works some are found capable of surprizing changes others as durable and hard to be destroyd or changd by fire or utmost art so various are the subjects of our contemplation that even the study of these inglorious parts of nature in the nether world is able itself alone to yield large matter and employment for the busiest spirits of men who in the labour of these experiments can willingly consume their lives—but the noisom poisonous steams which the earth breathes from these dark caverns where she conceals her treasures suffer not prying mortals to live long in this search how comfortable is it to those who come out hence alive to breathe a purer air to see the rejoicing light of day and tread the fertile ground how gladly they contemplate the surface of the earth their habitation heated and enlivend by the sun and temperd by the fresh air of fanning breezes these exercise the resty plants and scour the unactive globe and shaftesbury  0       when the sun draws hence thick clouded steams and vapours tis only to digest and exalt the unwholesom particles and commit em to the sprightly air which soon imparting its quick and vital spirit renders em again with improvement to the earth in gentle breathings or in rich dews and fruitful showers the same air moving about the mighty mass enters its pores impregnating the whole and both the sun and air conspiring so animate this motherearth that tho ever breeding her vigour is as great her beauty as fresh and her looks as charming as if she newly came out of the forming hands of her creator how beautiful is the water among the inferior earthly works heavy liquid and transparent without the springing vigour and expansive force of air but not without activity stubborn and unyielding when compressd but placidly avoiding force and bending every way with ready fluency insinuating it dissolves     the lumpish earth frees the intangled bodys procures their intercourse and summons to the field the keen terrestrial particles whole happy strifes soon ending in strict union produce the various forms which we behold how vast shaftesbury  0       are the abysses of the sea where this soft element is stord and whence the sun and winds extracting raise it into clouds these soon converted into rain water the thirsty ground and supply afresh the springs and rivers the comfort of the neighbouring plains and sweet refreshment of all animals but whither shall we trace the sources of the light or in what ocean comprehend the luminous matter so wide diffusd thro the immense spaces which it fills what seats shall we assign to that fierce element of fire too active to be confind within the compass of the sun and not excluded even the bowels of the heavy earth the air itself submits to it and serves as its inferior instrument even this our sun with all those numerous suns the glittering host of heaven seem to receive from hence the vast supplies which keep them ever in their splendid state the invisible etherial substance penetrating both liquid and solid bodys is diffusd throout the universe it cherishes the cold dull massy globe and warms it to its center it forms the minerals gives life and growth to vegetables kindles a soft invisible and vital flame in the breasts of living shaftesbury  0    0  creatures frames animates and nurses all the various forms sparing as well as imploying for their use those sulphurous and combustible matters of which they are composd benign and gentle amidst all it still maintains this happy peace and concord according to its stated and peculiar laws but these once broken the acquitted being takes its course unruld it runs impetuous thro the fatal breach and breaking into visible and fierce flames passes triumphant oer the yielding forms converting all into itself and dissolving now those systems which itself before had formd tis thus— here theocles stopt on a sudden when as he imagind i was putting my hand out to lay hold on his sleeve     o philocles said he tis well rememberd i was growing too warm i find as well i might indeed in this hot element and here perhaps i might have talkd yet more mysteriously had you been one who coud think otherwise than in the common way of the soft flames of love you might perhaps have heard wonders in this kind how all things had their being hence and how their shaftesbury  0       noblest end was to be here wrapt up consumd and lost—but in these high flights i might possibly have gone near to burn my wings indeed said i you might well expect the fate of icarus for your highsoaring but this indeed was not what i feard for you were got above danger and with that devouring element on your side had masterd not only the sun himself but every thing which stood in your way i was afraid it might in the issue run to what they tell us of a universal conflagration in which i knew not how it might go possibly with our genius i am glad said he philocles to find this grown such a concern with you but you may rest secure here if the case you meant were that periodical conflagration talkd of by some philosophers for there the genius woud of necessity be all in all and in those intervals of creation when no form nor species existed anywhere out of the divine mind all then was deity all was that one collected thus within itself and subsisting as they imagind rather in a more simple and perfect manner than when multiplyd in more ways and becoming pro shaftesbury  0      ductive it unfolded itself in the various map of nature and this fair visible world but for my part said i interrupting him who can much better see divinity unfolded than in that involvd and solitary state before creation i coud wish you woud go a little further with me in the map of nature especially if descending from your lofty flights you woud be content to pitch upon this humble spot of earth where i coud better accompany you whereer you led me but you replyd he who woud confine me to this heavy earth must yet allow me the same wings of fancy how else shall i fly with you thro different climates from pole to pole and from the frigid to the torrid zone     o said i for this purpose i will allow you the pegasus of the poets or that wingd griffin which an italian poet of the moderns gave to one of his heroes yet on this condition that you take no such extravagant flight as his was to the moon but keep closely to this orb of earth since you will have it so replyd theocles let us try first on the darkest shaftesbury  0       and most imperfect parts of our map and see how you can endure the prospect how oblique and faintly looks the sun on yonder climates far removd from him how tedious are the winters there how deep the horrors of the night and how uncomfortable even the light of day the freezing winds employ their fiercest breath yet are not spent with blowing the sea which elsewhere is scarce confind within its limits lies here immurd in walls of chrystal the snow covers the hills and almost fills the lowest valleys how wide and deep it lies incumbent oer the plains hiding the sluggish rivers the shrubs and trees the dens of beasts and mansions of distressd and feeble men—see where they lie confind hardly secure against the raging cold or the attacks of the wild beasts now masters of the wasted field and forcd by hunger out of the naked woods—yet not disheartend such is the force of human breasts but thus provided for by art and prudence the kind compensating gifts of heaven men and their herds may wait for a release for at length the sun approaching melts the snow sets longing men at liberty and affords them means and time to make provision against the shaftesbury  0       next return of cold it breaks the icy fetters of the main where vast seamonsters pierce thro floating islands with arms which can withstand the chrystal rock whilst others who of themselves seem great as islands are by their bulk alone armd against all but man whose superiority over creatures of such stupendous size and force shoud make him mindful of his privilege of reason and force him humbly to adore the great composer of these wondrous frames and author of his own superior wisdom but leaving these dull climates so little favourd by the sun     for those happier regions on which he looks more kindly making perpetual summer how great an alteration do we find his purer light confounds weaksighted mortals piercd by his scorching beams scarce can they tread the glowing ground the air they breathe cannot enough abate the fire which burns within their panting breasts their bodys melt oercome and fainting they seek the shade and wait the cool refreshments of the night yet oft the bounteous creator bestows other refreshments he casts a veil of clouds before em and raises gentle gales favourd by which the men and beasts shaftesbury  0       pursue their labours and plants refreshd by dews and showers can gladly bear the warmest sunbeams and here the varying scene opens to new wonders we see a country rich with gems but richer with the fragrant spices it affords how gravely move the largest of landcreatures on the banks of this fair river how ponderous are their arms and vast their strength with courage and a sense superior to the other beasts yet are they tamd we see by mankind and brought even to fight their battels rather as allies and confederates than as slaves—but let us turn our eyes towards these smaller and more curious objects the numerous and devouring insects on the trees in these wide plains how shining strong and lasting are the subtile threds spun from their artful mouths who beside the allwise has taught em to compose the beautiful soft shells in which recluse and buryd yet still alive they undergo such a surprizing change when not destroyd by men who clothe and adorn themselves with the labours and lives of these weak creatures and are proud of wearing such inglorious spoils how sumptuously appareld gay and splendid are all the va shaftesbury  0      rious insects which feed on the other plants of this warm region how beautiful the plants themselves in all their various growths from the triumphant palm down to the humble moss now may we see that happy country where precious gums and balsams flow from trees and nature yields her most delicious fruits how tame and tractable how patient of labour and of     thirst are those large creatures who lifting up their lofty heads go led and loaden thro these dry and barren places their shape and temper show them framd by nature to submit to man and fitted for his service who from hence ought to be more sensible of his wants and of the divine bounty thus supplying them but see not far from us that fertilest of lands waterd and fed by a friendly generous stream which ere it enters the sea divides itself into many branches to dispense more equally the rich and nitrous manure it bestows so kindly and in due time on the adjacent plains—fair image of that fruitful and exuberant nature who with a flood of bounty blesses all things and parentlike out of her many breasts sends the nutritious draught shaftesbury  0       in various streams to her rejoicing offspring—innumerable are the dubious forms and unknown species which drink the slimy current whether they are such as leaving the scorchd desarts satiate here their ardent thirst and promiscuously engendring beget a monstrous race or whether as it is said by the suns genial heat active on the fermenting ooze new forms are generated and issue from the rivers fertile bed—see there the noted tyrant of the flood and terror of its borders when suddenly displaying his horrid form the amphibious ravager invades the land quitting his watry den and from the deep emerging with hideous rush sweeps oer the trembling plain the natives from afar behold with wonder the enormous bulk sprung from so small an egg with horror they relate the monsters nature cruel and deceitful how he with dire hypocrisy and false tears beguiles the simplehearted and inspiring tenderness and kind compassion kills with pious fraud—sad emblem of that spiritual plague dire superstition native of this soil where first religion grew unsociable and among different worshipers bred mutual hatred and abhorrence of shaftesbury  0       each others temples the infection spreads and nations now profane one to another war fiercer and in religions cause forget humanity whilst savage zeal with meek and     pious semblance works dreadful massacre and for heavens sake horrid pretence makes desolate the earth— here let us leave these monsters glad if we coud here confine em and detesting the dire prolifick soil fly to the vast desarts of these parts all ghastly and hideous as they appear they want not their peculiar beautys the wildness pleases we seem to live alone with nature we view her in her inmost recesses and contemplate her with more delight in these original wilds than in the artificial labyrinths and feignd wildernesses of the palace the objects of the place the scaly serpents the savage beasts and poisonous insects how terrible soever or how contrary to human nature are beauteous in themselves and fit to raise our thoughts in admiration of that divine wisdom so far superior to our short views unable to declare the use or service of all things in this universe we are yet assurd of the perfection of all and of the justice of that oeconomy to which all things are subservient and shaftesbury  0       in respect of which things seemingly deformd are amiable disorder becomes regular corruption wholesom and poisons such as these we have seen prove healing and beneficial but behold thro a vast tract of sky before us the mighty atlas rears his lofty head coverd with snow above the clouds beneath the mountains foot the rocky country rises into hills a proper basis of the ponderous mass above where huge embodyd rocks lie pild on one another and seem to prop the high arch of heaven—see with what trembling steps poor mankind tread the narrow brink of the deep precipices from whence with giddy horror they look down mistrusting even the ground which bears em whilst they hear the hollow sound of torrents underneath and see the ruin of the impending rock with falling trees which hang with their roots upwards and seem to draw more ruin after em here thoughtless men seizd with the newness of such objects become thoughtful and willingly contemplate the incessant changes of this earths surface they see as in one instant the revolutions of past ages the fleeting forms of things and the decay even of this our globe whose shaftesbury  0    0  youth and first formation     they consider whilst the apparent spoil and irreparable breaches of the wasted mountain shew them the world itself only as a noble ruin and make them think of its approaching period—but here midway the mountain a spacious border of thick wood harbours our wearyd travellers who now are come among the evergreen and lofty pines the firs and noble cedars whose towring heads seem endless in the sky the rest of trees appearing only as shrubs beside them and here a different horror seizes our shelterd travellers when they see the day diminishd by the deep shapes of the vast wood which closing thick above spreads darkness and eternal night below the faint and gloomy light looks horrid as the shade itself and the profound stillness of these places imposes silence upon men struck with the hoarse echoings of every sound within the spacious caverns of the wood here space astonishes silence itself seems pregnant whilst an unknown force works on the mind and dubious objects move the wakeful sense mysterious voices are either heard or fansyd and various forms of deity seem to present themselves and appear more manifest in these sacred silvan shaftesbury  0       scenes such as of old gave rise to temples and favourd the religion of the antient world even we ourselves who in plain characters may read divinity from so many bright parts of earth chuse rather these obscurer places to spell out that mysterious being which to our weak eyes appears at best under a veil of cloud— here he pausd awhile and began to cast about his eyes which before seemd fixd he lookd more calmly with an open countenance and free air by which and other tokens i coud easily find we were come to an end of our descriptions and that whether i woud or no theocles was now resolvd to take his leave of the sublime the morning being spent and the forenoon by this time well advancd     sect   section ii methinks said he philocles changing to a familiar voice we had better leave these unsociable places whither our fancy has transported us and return to ourselves here again in our more conversable woods and temperate climates here no fierce heats nor colds shaftesbury  0       annoy us no precipices nor cataracts amaze us nor need we here be afraid of our own voices whilst we hear the notes of such a chearful quire and find the echoes rather agreeable and inviting us to talk i confess said i those foreign nymphs if there were any belonging to those miraculous woods were much too awful beautys to please me i found our familiar homenymphs a great deal more to my humour yet for all this i cannot help being concernd for your breaking off just when we were got half the world over and wanted only to take america in our way home indeed as for europe i coud excuse your making any great tour there because of the little variety it woud afford us besides that it woud be hard to see it in any view without meeting still that politick face of affairs which woud too much disturb us in our philosophical flights but for the western tract i cannot imagine why you shoud neglect such noble subjects as are there unless perhaps the gold and silver to which i find you such a bitter enemy frighted you from a mothersoil so full of it if these countrys had been as bare of those metals as old sparta we might have heard more perhaps of the perus and mexicos than of all shaftesbury  0       asia and africa we might have had creatures plants woods mountains rivers beyond any of those we have passd how sorry am i to lose the noble amazon how sorry— here as i woud have proceeded i saw so significant a smile on theocless face that it stopt me out of curiosity to ask him his thought nothing said he nothing but this very subject itself—go on—i see youll finish it for me the spirit of this sort of prophecy   0 has seizd you and philocles the cold indifferent philocles is become a pursuer of the same mysterious beauty tis true said i theocles i own it your genius the genius of the place and the great genius have at last prevaild i shall no longer resist the passion growing in me for things of a natural kind where neither art natural beautys  nor the conceit or caprice of man has spoild their genuine order by breaking in upon that primitive state even the rude rocks the mossy caverns the irregular unwrought grottos and broken falls of waters with all the horrid graces of the wilderness itself as representing nature more will be the more engaging and appear with a shaftesbury  0       magnificence beyond the formal mockery of princely gardens—but tell me i intreat you how comes it that excepting a few philosophers of your sort passion of this kind  the only people who are enamourd in this way and seek the woods the rivers or seashores are your poor vulgar lovers say not this replyd he of lovers only for is it not the same with poets and all those other students in nature and the arts which copy after her in short is not this the real case of all who are lovers either of the muses or the graces enthusiasm however said i all those who are deep in this romantick way are lookd upon you know as a people either plainly out of their wits or overrun with melancholy and enthusiasm we always endeavour to recall em from these solitary places and i must own that often when i have found my fancy run this way i have checkd myself not knowing what it was possessd me when i was passionately struck with objects of this kind shaftesbury  0      no wonder replyd he if we are at a loss when we pursue the shadow for the substance shadows  for if we may trust to what our reasoning has taught us whatever in nature is beautiful or charming is only the faint shadow of that first beauty first beauty  so that every real love depending on the mind and being only the contemplation     of beauty either as it really is in itself or as it appears imperfectly in the objects which strike the sense how can the rational mind rest here or be satisfyd with the absurd enjoyment which reaches the sense alone from this time forward then said i i shall no more have reason to fear those beautys which strike a sort of melancholy like the places we have namd or like these solemn groves no more shall i avoid the moving accents of soft musick or fly from the enchanting features of the fairest human face if you are already replyd he such a proficient in this new love that you are sure never to admire the representativebeauty except for the sake of the original original  nor aim at other enjoyment than of the rational kind you may then be confident i am so and presume accordingly to answer for myself however i shaftesbury  0       shoud not be ill satisfyd if you explaind yourself a little better as to this mistake of mine you seem to fear woud it be any help to tell you enjoyment  that the absurdity lay in seeking the enjoyment elsewhere than in the subject lovd the matter i must confess is still mysterious imagine then good philocles if being taken with the beauty of the ocean which you see yonder at a distance it shoud come into your head to seek how to command it and like some mighty admiral ride master of the sea woud not the fancy be a little absurd absurd enough in conscience the next thing i shoud do tis likely upon this frenzy woud be to hire some bark and go in nuptial ceremony venetianlike to wed the gulf which i might call perhaps as properly my own let who will call it theirs replyd theocles you will own the enjoyment of this kind to be very different from that which shoud naturally follow from the contemplation of the oceans beauty the bridegroomdoge who in his stately bucentaur floats on the bosom of his thetis has less possession than the poor shepherd who from a hanging rock or point of some high promontory stretchd at his ease forgets his feeding flocks while he admires her beauty—but to come nearer shaftesbury  0       home and make the question     still more familiar suppose my philocles that viewing such a tract of country as this delicious vale we see beneath us you shoud for the enjoyment of the prospect require the property or possession of the land the covetous fancy replyd i woud be as absurd altogether as that other ambitious one o philocles said he may i bring this yet a little nearer and will you follow me once more suppose that being charmd as you seem to be with the beauty of these trees under whose shade we rest you shoud long for nothing so much as to taste some delicious fruit of theirs and having obtaind of nature some certain relish by which these acorns or berrys of the wood became as palatable as the figs or peaches of the garden you shoud afterwards as oft as you revisted these groves seek hence the enjoyment of them by satiating yourself in these new delights the fancy of this kind replyd i woud be sordidly luxurious and as absurd in my opinion as either of the former shaftesbury  0      can you not then on this occasion said he call to mind some other forms of a fair kind among us where the admiration of beauty is apt to lead to as irregular a consequence i feard said i indeed where this woud end and was apprehensive you woud force me at last to think of certain powerful forms in human kind which draw after em a set of eager desires wishes and hopes no way sutable i must confess to your rational and refind contemplation of beauty the proportions of this living architecture as wonderful as they are inspire nothing of a studious or contemplative kind the more they are viewd the further they are from satisfying by mere view let that which satisfies be ever so disproportionable an effect or ever so foreign to its cause censure it as you please you must allow however that its natural so that you theocles for ought i see are become the accuser of nature by condemning a natural enjoyment far be it from us both said he to condemn a joy which is from nature but when we spoke of the enjoyment of these woods and prospects we understood by it a far different kind from that shaftesbury  0           of the inferior creatures who rifling in these places find here their choicest food yet we too live by tasteful food and feel those other joys of sense in common with them but twas not here my philocles that we had agreed to place our good nor consequently our enjoyment we who were rational and had minds methought shoud place it rather in those minds which were indeed abusd and cheated of their real good when drawn to seek absurdly the enjoyment of it in the objects of sense and not in those objects they might properly call their own in which kind as i remember we comprehended all which was truly fair generous or good so that beauty said i and good beauty and good  with you theocles i perceive are still one and the same tis so said he and thus are we returnd again to the subject of our yesterdays morningconversation whether i have made good my promise to you in shewing †the true good i know not but so doubtless i shoud have done with good success had i been able in my poetick extasys or by any other efforts to have shaftesbury  0   00  led you into some deep view of nature and the sovereign genius we then had provd the force of divine beauty and formd in ourselves an object capable and worthy of real enjoyment o theocles said i well do i remember now the terms in which you engagd me that morning when you bespoke my love of this mysterious beauty you have indeed made good your part of the condition and may now claim me for a proselyte if there be any seeming extravagance in the case i must comfort myself the best i can and consider that all sound love and admiration is ‡enthusiasm the transports of poets the sublime of orators the rapture of musicians the high strains of the virtuosi all mere enthusiasm even learning itself the love of arts and     curiositys the spirit of travellers and adventurers gallantry war heroism all all enthusiasm—tis enough i am content to be this new enthusiast in a way unknown to me before and i replyd theocles am content you shoud call this love of ours enthusiasm allowing it the privilege of its fellowpassions for is there shaftesbury  0   0   a fair and plausible enthusiasm a reasonable extasy and transport allowd to other subjects such as architecture painting musick and shall it be exploded here are there senses by which all those other graces and perfections are perceivd and none by which this higher perfection and grace is comprehended is it so preposterous to bring that enthusiasm hither and transfer it from those secondary and scanty objects to this original and comprehensive one observe how the case stands in all those other subjects of art or science arts  what difficulty to be in any degree knowing how long ere a true taste is gaind a judgment taste  how many things shocking how many offensive at first which afterwards are known and acknowledgd the highest beautys for tis not instantly we acquire the sense by which these beautys are discoverable labour and pains are requird and time to cultivate a natural genius ever so apt or forward but who is there once thinks of cultivating this soil improvement  or of improving any sense or faculty which nature may have given of this kind and is it a wonder we shoud be dull then as we are confounded and at a loss in these affairs blind as to this higher scene these nobler representations which way shoud we come to understand better which way be knowing in these beautys is study science or shaftesbury  0   0   learning necessary to understand all beautys else and for the sovereign beauty chief science  is there no skill or science requird in painting there are shades and masterly strokes which the vulgar understand not but find fault with in architecture there is the rustick in musick the chromatick kind and skilful mixture of dissonancys and is there nothing which answers to this in the whole i must confess said i i have hitherto been one of those vulgar who coud never relish the shades the rustick or the dissonancys you talk of i have never dreamt of such masterpieces in nature     twas my way to censure freely on the first view but i perceive i am now obligd to go far in the pursuit of beauty beauty  which lies very absconded and deep and if so i am well assurd that my enjoyments hitherto have been very shallow i have dwelt it seems all this while upon the surface and enjoyd only a kind of slight superficial beautys having never gone in search of beauty itself but of what i fansyd such like the rest of the unthinking world i took for granted that what i liked was beautiful and what i rejoicd in was my good i never scrupled loving what i fansyd and aiming only at the enjoyment of what i lovd i never troubled myself with ex shaftesbury  0   0  amining what the subjects were nor ever hesitated about their choice begin then said he and chuse see what the subjects are and which you woud prefer which honour with your admiration love and esteem for by these again you will be honourd in your turn such philocles as is the worth of these companions such will your worth be found as there is emptiness or fulness here so will there be in your enjoyment see therefore where fulness is and where emptiness see in what subject resides the chief excellence where beauty reigns where tis intire perfect absolute where broken imperfect short view these terrestrial beautys and whatever has the appearance of excellence and is able to attract see that which either really is or stands as in the room of fair beautiful and good a mass of metal a tract of land a number of slaves a pile of stones a human body of certain lineaments and proportions is this the highest of the kind is beauty founded then in body only and not in action life or operation— hold hold said i good theocles you take this in too high a key above my reach if you woud have me shaftesbury  0   0   accompany you pray lower this strain a little and talk in a more familiar way thus then said he smiling whatever passion you may have for other beautys i know good philocles you are no such admirer of wealth in any kind as to allow much beauty to it especially in a rude heap or mass but in medals coins imbostwork     statues and wellfabricated pieces of whatever sort you can discover beauty and admire the kind true said i but not for the metals sake  tis not then the metal or matter which is beautiful with you no but the art certainly the art then is the beauty right and the art is that which beautifies the same so that the beautifying not the beautifyd is the really beautiful it seems so for that which is beautifyd is beautiful only by the accession of something beautifying and by the recess or withdrawing of the same it ceases to be beautiful be it in respect of bodys therefore beauty comes and goes so we see nor is the body itself any cause either of its coming or staying none so that there is no principle of beauty in body none at all for body can noway be the cause of beauty to it shaftesbury  0   0  self noway nor govern nor regulate itself nor yet this nor mean nor intend itself nor this neither must not that therefore which means and intends for it regulates and orders it be the principle of beauty to it of necessity and what must that be mind i suppose for what can it be else here then said he is all i woud have explaind to you before that the beautiful the fair the comely were never in the matter but in the art and design never in body itself but in the form or forming power does not the beautiful form confess this and speak the beauty of the design wheneer it strikes you what is it but the design which strikes what is it you admire but mind or the effect of mind tis mind alone which forms all which is void of mind is horrid and matter formless is deformity itself of all forms then said i those according to your scheme are the most amiable and in the first order of beauty which have a power of making other forms themselves from whence methinks they may be styld the forming forms so far i can easily concur with you and gladly give the advantage to the human shaftesbury  0   0   form above those other beautys of mans formation the palaces equipages and estates shall never in my account be brought in competition with the original living forms of flesh and blood and for the other the dead forms of nature the metals and stones however precious     and dazling i am resolvd to resist their splendour and make abject things of em even in their highest pride when they pretend to set off human beauty and are officiously brought in aid of the fair orders of beauty first order do you not see then replyd theocles that you have establishd three degrees or orders of beauty as how why first the dead forms as you properly have calld em which bear a fashion and are formd whether by man or nature but have no forming power no action or intelligence right next and as the second kind the forms which form second order  that is which have intelligence action and operation right still here therefore is double beauty for here is both the form the effect of mind and mind itself the first kind low and despicable in respect of this other from whence the dead form receives its lustre and force of beauty for what is a mere body tho a human one and ever so exactly fashiond if in shaftesbury  0   0  ward form be wanting and the mind be monstrous or imperfect as in an idiot or savage this too i can apprehend said i but where is the third order have patience replyd he and see first whether you have discoverd the whole force of this second beauty how else shoud you understand the force of love or have the power of enjoyment tell me i beseech you when first you namd these the forming forms did you think of no other productions of theirs besides the dead kinds such as the palaces the coins the brazen or the marble figures of men or did you think of something nearer life i coud easily said i have added that these forms of ours had a virtue of producing other living forms like themselves but this virtue of theirs i thought was from another form above them and coud not properly be calld their virtue or art if in reality there was a superior art or something artistlike which guided their hand and made tools of them in this specious work happily thought said he you have prevented a censure which i hardly imagind you coud escape and here you shaftesbury  0   0   have unawares discoverd that third order of beauty third order  which forms not only     such as we call mere forms but even the forms which form for we ourselves are notable architects in matter and can shew lifeless bodys brought into form and fashiond by our own hands but that which fashions even minds themselves contains in itself all the beautys fashiond by those minds and is consequently the principle source and fountain of all beauty it seems so therefore whatever beauty appears in our second order of forms or whatever is derivd or producd from thence all this is eminently principally and originally in this last order of supreme and sovereign beauty true thus architecture musick and all which is of human invention resolves itself into this last order right said i and thus all the enthusiasms of other kinds resolve themselves into ours the fashionable kinds borrow from us and are nothing without us we have undoubtedly the honour of being originals shaftesbury  0   0  now therefore say again replyd theocles whether are those fabricks of architecture sculpture and the rest of that sort the greatest beautys which man forms or are there greater and better none which i know replyd i think think again said he and setting aside those productions which just now you excepted against as masterpieces of another hand think what there are which more immediately proceed from us and may more truly be termd our issue i am barren said i for this time you must be plainer yet in helping me to conceive how can i help you replyd he woud you have me be conscious for you of that which is immediately your own and is solely in and from yourself you mean my sentiments said i certainly beauty moral  replyd he and together with your sentiments your resolutions principles determinations actions whatsoever is handsom and noble in the kind whatever flows from your good understanding sense knowledg and will whatever is ingenderd in your heart good philocles or derives itself from your parentmind offspring generation  which unlike to other parents is never spent or exhausted but gains strength and vigor by producing so you my friend have shaftesbury  0    0  provd it by many a work     not suffering that fertile part to remain idle and unactive hence those good parts which from a natural genius you have raisd by due improvement and here as i cannot but admire the pregnant genius and parentbeauty so am i satisfyd of the offspring that it is and will be ever beautiful i took the compliment and wishd i told him the case were really as he imagind that i might justly merit his esteem and love my study therefore shoud be to grow beautiful in his way of beauty and from this time forward i woud do all i coud to propagate that lovely race of mental children source  happily sprung from such a high enjoyment and from a union with what was fairest and best but tis you theocles continud i must help my labouring mind and be as it were the midwife to those conceptions which else i fear will prove abortive you do well replyd he to give me the midwifes part only for the mind conceiving of itself can only be as you say assisted in the birth pregnancy  its pregnancy is from its nature nor coud it ever have been thus impregnated by any other mind than that which formd it at the beginning and which as we have already shaftesbury  0       provd is original to all mental as well as other beauty do you maintain then said i that these mental children the notions and principles of fair just and honest with the rest of these ideas are innate innate ideas anatomists said he tell us that the eggs which are principles in body are innate being formd already in the foetus before the birth but when it is whether before or at or after the birth or at what time after that either these or other principles organs of sensation or sensations themselves are first formd in us is a matter doubtless of curious speculation but of no great importance the question is whether the principles spoken of are from art or nature if from nature purely tis no matter for the time nor woud i contend with you tho you shoud deny life itself to be innate as imagining it followd rather than preceded the moment of birth but this i am certain of that life and the sensations which accompany life come when they will are from mere nature and   0 nothing else therefore if you dislike the word innate let us change it if you will for instinct and call instinct instinct  that which nature teaches exclusive of art culture or discipline content said i shaftesbury  0      leaving then replyd he those admirable speculations to the virtuosi the anatomists and schooldivines we may safely aver with all their consents that the several organs particularly those of generation generation  are formd by nature whether is there also from nature think you any instinct for the afteruse of them or whether must learning and experience imprint this use  tis imprinted said i enough in conscience the impression or instinct is so strong in the case that twoud be absurdity not to think it natural as well in our own species as in other creatures amongst whom as you have already taught me not only the mere engendring of the young but the various and almost infinite means and methods of providing for them are all foreknown for thus much we may indeed discern in the preparatory labours and arts of these wild creatures which demonstrate their anticipating fancys preconceptions  preconceptions or presensations if i may use a word you taught me yesterday i allow your expression said theocles and will endeavour to show you that the same preconceptions of a higher degree have place in human kind do shaftesbury  0       so said i i intreat you for so far am i from finding in myself these preconceptions of fair and beautiful in your sense that methinks till now of late i have hardly known of any thing like them in nature how then said he woud you have known that outward fair and beautiful of human kind if such an object a fair fleshly one in all its beauty had for the first time appeard to you by yourself this morning in these groves or do you think perhaps you shoud have been unmovd and have found no difference between this form and any other if first you had not been instructed i have hardly any right replyd i to plead this last opinion after what i have ownd just before     well then said he that i may appear to take no advantage against you i quit the dazling form which carrys such a force of complicated beautys and am contented to consider separately each of those simple beautys which taken all together create this wonderful effect for you will allow without doubt that in respect of bodys whatever is commonly said of the unexpressible the unintelligible the iknownotwhat of beauty there can lie no mystery here but what plainly shaftesbury  0       belongs either to figure colour motion or sound omitting therefore the three latter beauty of body  and their dependent charms let us view the charm in what is simplest of all mere figure nor need we go so high as sculpture architecture or the designs of those who from this study of beauty have raisd such delightful arts tis enough if we consider the simplest of figures as either a round ball a cube or dye why is even an infant pleasd with the first view of these proportions why is the sphere or globe the cylinder and obelisk preferd and the irregular figures in respect of these rejected and despisd i am ready replyd i to own there is in certain figures a natural beauty which the eye finds as soon as the object is presented to it beauty of soul as real and necessarily moving is there then said he a natural beauty of figures and is there not as natural a one of actions no sooner the eye opens upon figures the ear to sounds than straight the beautiful results and grace and harmony are known and acknowledgd no sooner are actions viewd no sooner the human affections and shaftesbury  0       passions discernd and they are most of em as soon discernd as felt than straight an inward eye distinguishes and sees the fair and shapely the amiable and admirable apart from the deformd the foul idea natural  the odious or the despicable how is it possible therefore not to own that as these distinctions have their foundation in nature the discernment itself is natural and from nature alone if this i told him were as he represented it there coud never i thought be any disagreement among men concerning actions     and behaviour as which was base which worthy which handsom and which deformd but now we found perpetual variance among mankind whose differences were chiefly founded on this disagreement in opinion the one affirming the other denying that this or that was fit or decent even by this then replyd he it appears there is fitness and decency in actions the fit and decent  since the fit and decent is in this controversy ever presupposd and whilst men are at odds about the subjects the thing itself is universally agreed for neither is there agreement in judgments about other beautys tis controverted which is the finest pile the loveliest shape or face but without controversy shaftesbury  0       tis allowd there is a beauty of each kind this noone goes about to teach nor is it learnt by any but confessd by all standard ownd  all own the standard rule and measure but in applying it to things disorder arises ignorance prevails interest and passion breed disturbance nor can it otherwise happen in the affairs of life whilst that which interests and engages men as good is thought different from that which they admire and praise as honest—but with us philocles tis better settled since for our parts we have already decreed that beauty and good are still the same confirmation i remember said i what you forcd me to acknowledg more than once before and now good theocles that i am become so willing a disciple i want not so much to be convincd methinks as to be confirmd and strengthend and i hope this last work may prove your easiest task not unless you help in it yourself replyd theocles for this is necessary as well as becoming it had been indeed shameful for you to have yielded without making good resistance to help ones shaftesbury  0      self to be convincd is to prevent reason and bespeak error and delusion but upon fair conviction to give our heart up to the evident side and reinforce the impression this is to help reason     heartily and thus we may be said honestly to persuade ourselves shew me then how i may best persuade myself have courage said he philocles raising his voice be not offended that i say have courage tis cowardice alone betrays us for whence can false shame be except from cowardice to be ashamd of what one is sure can never be shameful must needs be from the want of resolution we seek the right and wrong in things we examine what is honourable what shameful and having at last determind we dare not stand to our own judgment and are ashamd to own there is really a shameful and an honourable hear me says one who pretends to value philocles and be valud by him there can be no such thing as real valuableness or worth nothing in itself estimable or amiable odious or shameful all is opinion opinion fashion  tis opinion which makes beauty and unmakes it the graceful or ungraceful in things the decorum and its contrary the amiable and unamiable vice virtue measure of virtue and vice  honour shame all this is founded shaftesbury  0       in opinion only opinion is the law and measure nor has opinion any rule besides mere chance which varys it as custom varys and makes now this now that to be thought worthy according to the reign of fashion and the ascendent power of education falshood of this  what shall we say to such a one how represent to him his absurdity and extravagance will he desist the sooner or shall we ask what shame of one who acknowledges no shameful yet he derides and cries ridiculous by what right what title for thus if i were philocles woud i defend myself am i ridiculous as how what is ridiculous everything or nothing  ridiculous indeed but something then something there is ridiculous and the notion it seems is right shame  of a shameful and a ridiculous in things  how then shall we apply the notion for this being wrong applyd cannot itself but be ridiculous or will he who cries shame refuse to acknowledg any in his turn does he not blush nor seem discountenancd on any occasion if he does the case is very distinct from that of mere grief or fear the disorder he feels is from     a sense of what is shameful and odious in itself not of what is hurtful or dangerous in its consequences shaftesbury  0       for the greatest danger in the world can never breed shame nor can the opinion of all the world compel us to it where our own opinion is not a party we may be afraid of appearing impudent and may therefore feign a modesty but we can never really blush for any thing beside what we think truly shameful and what we shoud still blush for were we ever so secure as to our interest and out of the reach of all inconvenience which coud happen to us from the thing we were ashamd of thus continud he shoud i be able by anticipation to defend myself and looking narrowly into mens lives and that which influencd em on all occasions i shoud have testimony enough to make me say within myself let who will be my adversary in this opinion i shall find him some way or other prepossessd with that of which he woud endeavour to dispossess me an acknowledgment of moral beauty and deformity  has he gratitude or resentment pride or shame whichever way it be he acknowledges a sense of just and unjust worthy and mean if he be grateful or expects gratitude i ask why and on what account if he be angry if he indulges revenge i ask how and in what case revengd of what of a stone or madman anger  who is so mad but shaftesbury  0    0  for what for a chancehurt an accident against thought or intention anger an acknowledgment of just and unjust  who is so unjust therefore there is just and unjust and belonging to it a natural presumption or anticipation on which the resentment or anger is founded for what else shoud make the wickedest of mankind often prefer the interest of their revenge to all other interests and even to life itself except only a sense of wrong natural to all men and a desire to prosecute that wrong at any rate not for their own sakes since they sacrifice their very being to it but out of hatred to the imagind wrong and from a certain love of justice which even in unjust men is by this example shewn to be beyond the love of life itself pride thus as to pride i ask why proud why conceited and of what does anyone who has pride think meanly or indifferently of himself no but honourably and how this if there be no     real honour or dignity presupposd for selfvaluation supposes selfworth pride an acknowledgment of worth and baseness  and in a person conscious of real worth is either no pride or a just and noble onein the same manner selfcontempt supposes a selfmeanness or defectiveness and may be either a just modesty or unjust humility but this is cer shaftesbury  0      tain that whoever is proud must be proud of something and we know that men of thorow pride will be proud even in the meanest circumstances and when there is no visible subject for them to be proud of but they descry a merit in themselves which others cannot and tis this merit they admire no matter whether it be really in them as they imagine it is a worth still an honour or merit which they admire and woud do wherever they saw it in any subject besides for then it is then only that they are humbled when they see in a more eminent degree in others what they respect and admire so much in themselves—and thus as long as i find men either angry or revengeful proud or ashamd i am safe for they conceive an honourable and dishonourable a foul and fair as well as i no matter where they place it or how they are mistaken in it this hinders not my being satisfyd that the thing is and is universally acknowledgd that it is of natures impression naturally conceivd natural impression  and by no art or counternature to be eradicated or destroyd and now what say you philocles continud he to this defense i have been making for you tis grounded as you see on the supposition of shaftesbury  0       your being deeply ingagd in this philosophical cause but perhaps you have yet many difficultys to get over ere you can so far take part with beauty as to make this to be your good good i have no difficulty so great said i as not to be easily removd my inclinations lead me strongly this way for i am ready enough to yield there is no real good beside the enjoyment of beauty and i am as ready replyd theocles to yield there is no real enjoyment of beauty beside what is good excellent but upon reflection i fear i am little beholden to you for your concession as how because shoud i offer to contend for any enjoyment of     beauty out of your mental way you woud i doubt call such enjoyment of mine absurd as you did once before undoubtedly i shoud for what is it shoud enjoy mental enjoyment  or be capable of enjoyment except mind or shall we say body enjoys by the help of sense perhaps not otherwise is beauty then the object of sense say how which way for otherwise the help of sense is nothing in the case and if body be of itself incapable body  and sense no help to it to apprehend or enjoy beauty there remains only the mind which is capable either to apprehend or to enjoy shaftesbury  0      true said i but show me then why beauty may not be the object of the sense sense  shew me first i intreat you why where or in what you fansy it may be so is it not beauty which first excites the sense and feeds it afterwards in the passion we call love say in the same manner that it is beauty first excites the sense and feeds it afterwards in the passion we call hunger—you will not say it the thought i perceive displeases you as great as the pleasure is of good eating you disdain to apply the notion of beauty to the good dishes which create it you woud hardly have applauded the preposterous fancy of some luxurious romans of old who coud relish a fricassee the better for hearing it was composd of birds which wore a beautiful feather or had sung deliciously instead of being incited by such a historical account of meats you woud be apt i believe to have less appetite the more you searchd their origin and descended into the kitchinscience to learn the several forms and changes they had undergone ere they were servd at this elegant voluptuous table but tho the kitchinforms be ever so disgraceful you will allow that the materials of the kitchin such for instance as the garden furnishes are really fair and shaftesbury  0       beautiful in their kind nor will you deny beauty to the wild field or to these flowers which grow around us on this verdant couch and yet as lovely as are these forms of nature the shining grass or silverd moss the flowry thyme wild rose or honeysuckle tis not their beauty allures the neighbouring herds delights the brouzing fawn or kid and spreads the joy we see amidst the feeding flocks tis not the form     rejoices but that which is beneath the form tis savouriness attracts hunger impels and thirst better allayd by the clear brook than the thick puddle makes the fair nymph to be preferd whose form is otherwise slighted for never can the form be of real force where it is uncontemplated unjudgd of unexamind and stands only as the accidental note or token of what appeases provokd sense and satisfies the brutish part are you persuaded of this good philocles or rather than not give brutes the advantage of enjoyment will you allow them also a mind and rational part—not so i told him if brutes therefore said he be incapable of knowing and enjoying beauty as being brutes and having sense only the brutish part for their own share it follows that neither can man by shaftesbury  0       the same sense or brutish part conceive or enjoy beauty but all the beauty and good he enjoys is in a nobler way and by the help of what is noblest his mind and reason reason  here lies his dignity and highest interest here his capacity toward good and happiness his ability or incompetency his power of enjoyment or his impotence is founded in this alone as this is sound fair noble worthy so are its subjects acts and employments for as the riotous mind captive to sense can never enter in competition or contend for beauty with the virtuous mind of reasons culture comparison of objects  so neither can the objects which allure the former compare with those which attract and charm the latter and when each gratifies itself in the enjoyment and possession of its object and enjoyments  how evidently fairer are the acts which join the latter pair and give a soul the enjoyment of what is generous and good this at least philocles you will surely allow that when you place a joy elsewhere than in the mind the enjoyment itself will be no beautiful subject nor of any graceful or agreeable appearance but when you think how friendship is enjoyd how honour gratitude candour benignity and all internal beauty how all the social pleasures society itself and all which constitutes the worth and happi shaftesbury  0      ness of mankind you will here surely allow beauty in the act and think it worthy to be viewd and passd in review often by the glad mind happily     conscious of the generous part and of its own advancement and growth in beauty recapitulation thus philocles continud he after a short pause thus have i presumd to treat of beauty before so great a judg and such a skilful admirer as yourself for taking rise from natures beauty which transported me i gladly venturd further in the chase and have accompanyd you in search of beauty as it relates to us and makes our highest good in its sincere and natural enjoyment and if we have not idly spent our hours nor rangd in vain thro these deserted regions it shoud appear from our strict search that there is nothing so divine as beauty which belonging not to body nor having any principle or existence except in mind and reason is alone discoverd and acquird by this diviner part when it inspects itself the only object worthy of itself for whateer is void of mind is void and darkness to the minds eye this languishes and grows dim wheneer detaind on foreign subjects but thrives and attains its natural vigour shaftesbury  0       when employd in contemplation of what is like itself tis thus the improving mind slightly surveying other objects and passing over bodys and the common forms where only a shadow of beauty rests ambitiously presses onward to its source and views the original of form and order in that which is intelligent and thus o philocles may we improve and become artists in the kind learning to know ourselves and what that is which by improving we may be sure to advance our worth and real selfinterest for neither is this knowledg acquird by contemplation of bodys or the outward forms knowledg of ourselves  the view of pageantrys the study of estates and honours nor is he to be esteemd that selfimproving artist who makes a fortune out of these but he he only is the wise and able man who with a slight regard to these things applies himself to cultivate another soil builds in a different matter from that of stone or marble and having righter models in his eye interest  becomes in truth the architect of his own life and fortune by laying within himself the lasting and sure foundations of order peace ability  and concord—but     now tis time to think of returning home the morning is far spent come let us away and leave these uncommon sub shaftesbury  0      jects till we retire again to these remote and unfrequented places at these words theocles mending his pace and going down the hill left me at a good distance till he heard me calling earnestly after him having joind him once again i beggd he woud stay a little longer or if he were resolvd so soon to leave both the woods and that philosophy which he confind to em that he woud let me however part with em more gradually and leave the best impression on me he coud against my next return for as much convincd as i was and as great a convert to his doctrine my danger still i ownd to him was very great and i foresaw that when the charm of these places and his company was ceasd i shoud be apt to relapse and weakly yield to that too powerful charm the world tell me continud i how is it possible to hold out against it and withstand the general opinion of mankind who have so different a notion of that which we call good say truth now theocles can any thing be more odd or dissonant from the common voice of the world than what we have determind in this matter shaftesbury  0      whom shall we follow then replyd he whose judgment or opinion shall we take concerning what is good what contrary if all or any part of mankind are consonant with themselves and can agree in this i am content to leave philosophy and follow them if otherwise why shoud we not adhere to what we have chosen—let us then in another view consider how this matter stands sect   section iii we then walkd gently homewards it being almost noon and he continud his discourse manners of men one man said he affects the hero esteems it the highest advantage of life to have seen war and been in action in the   0 field another laughs at this humour counts it all extravagance and folly prizes his own wit and prudence and woud take it for a disgrace to be thought adventurous contrary pursuits  one person is assiduous and indefatigable in advancing himself to the character of a man of business another on the contrary thinks this impertinent values not fame or a character in the world and by his good shaftesbury  0    0 will woud always be in a debauch and never live out of the stews or taverns where he enjoys as he thinks his highest good one values wealth as a means only to indulge his palat and to eat finely mutual censure  another loaths this and affects popularity and a name one admires musick and paintings cabinetcuriositys and indoor ornaments another admires gardens architecture and the pomp of buildings another who has no gusto of either sort believes all those they call virtuosi to be halfdistracted one looks upon all expence to be madness and thinks only wealth itself to be good one games another dresses and studys an equipage another is full of heraldry points of honour disagreement with one another  a family and a blood one recommends gallantry and intrigue another ordinary goodfellowship another buffoonery satir and the common wit another sports and the country another a court another travelling and the sight of foreign parts another poetry and the fashionable learning—all these go different ways and with themselves  all censure one another and are despicable in one anothers eyes by fits too they are as despicable in their own and as often out of conceit with themselves as their humour changes and their passion turns from one thing to another—what is it then i shoud be concernd for shaftesbury  0       whose censure do i fear or by whom after all shall i be guided riches if i ask are riches good when only heapd up and unimployd one answers they are the rest deny how is it then they are to be imployd in order to be good all disagree all tell me different things since therefore riches are not of themselves good as most of you declare and since there is no agreement among you which way they become good why may not i hold it for my opinion that they are neither good in themselves nor directly any cause or means of good     if there be those who wholly despise fame and if among those who covet it fame and honour  he who desires it for one thing despises it for another he who seeks it with some men despises it with others why may not i say that neither do i know how any fame can be calld a good shaftesbury  0      if of those who covet pleasure pleasure  they who admire it in one kind are superior to it in another why may not i say that neither do i know which of these pleasures or how pleasure itself can be calld good life if among those who covet life ever so earnestly that life which to one is eligible and amiable is to another despicable and vile why may i not say that neither do i know how life itself can of itself be thought a good inslavement in the mean time this i know certainly that the necessary consequence of esteeming these things highly is to be a slave and consequently miserable—but perhaps philocles you are not yet enough acquainted with this odd kind of reasoning more said i than i believe you can easily imagine i perceivd the goodly lady your celebrated beauty was about to appear anew liberty  and i easily knew again that fair face of liberty which i had seen but once in the picture you drew yesterday of that moral dame i can assure you i think of her as highly as possible and find that without her help to raise one above these seemingly essential goods goods of fortune  and make one more easy and indifferent towards life and towards a fortune twill be the hardest thing in the world to enjoy either sollicitude cares shaftesbury  0       and anxiety will be multiplyd and in this unhappy dependency tis necessary to make court and be not a little servile to flatter the great to bear insults to stoop and fawn and abjectly resign ones sense and manhood all this must courageously be endurd and carryd off with as free an air and good countenance as possible by one who studys greatness of this sort who knows the general way of courts and how     to fix unsteddy fortune i need not mention the envyings the mistrusts and jealousys— no truly said he interrupting me neither need you but finding you so sensible as i do of this unhappy state and of its inward sores whatever may be its outward looks how is it possible but you must find the happiness of that other contrary state can you not call to mind what we resolvd concerning nature can any thing be more desirable than to follow her or is it not by this freedom from our passions and low interests that we are reconcild to the goodly order of the universe that we harmonize with nature and live in friendship both with god and man let us compare continud he goods of the mind  the advantages of each state and set their shaftesbury  0       goods one against another on one side those which we found were uncertainly so and depended both on fortune age circumstances and humour on the other side these which being certain themselves comparison  are founded on the contempt of those others so uncertain is manly liberty generosity magnanimity not a good may we not esteem as happiness that selfenjoyment which arises from a consistency of life and manners a harmony of affections a freedom from the reproach of shame or guilt and a consciousness of worth and merit with all mankind our society country and friends all which is founded in virtue only a mind subordinate to reason a temper humanizd and fitted to all natural affection an exercise of friendship uninterrupted a thorow candor benignity and good nature with constant security tranquillity equanimity if i may use such philosophical terms are not these ever and at all seasons good is it of these one can at any time nauseate and grow weary are there any particular ages seasons places circumstances which must accompany these to make em agreeable are these variable and inconstant do these by being ardently belovd or sought occasion any disturbance or misery can these be at any time overvalud or shaftesbury  0       to say more yet can these be ever taken from us or can we ever be hinderd in the enjoyment of em unless by ourselves how can we better praise the goodness of providence than in this that it     has placd our happiness and good in things we can bestow upon ourselves if this be so said i i see no reason we have to accuse providence on any account but men i fear will hardly be brought to this good temper while their fancy is so strong as it naturally is towards those other movable goods and in short if we may depend on what is said commonly all good is merely as we fansy it tis conceit which makes it all is opinion and fancy only opinion all wherefore then said he do we act at any time why chuse or why prefer one thing to another—you will tell me i suppose tis because we fansy it or fansy good in it—are we therefore to follow every present fancy opinion or imagination of good if so then we must follow that at one time which we decline at another approve at one time what we disapprove at another and be at perpetual variance with ourselves but if we are not to follow all fancy or opi shaftesbury  0      nion alike if it be allowd that of fancys some are true some false then we are to examine every fancy and there is some rule or other by which to judg and determine twas the fancy of one man to set fire to a beautiful temple in order to obtain immortal memory or fame twas the fancy of another man to conquer the world for the same reason or what was very like it if this were really the mans good why do we wonder at him if the fancy were wrong say plainly in what it was so or why the subject was not good to him as he fansyd either therefore that is every mans good which he fansys and because he fansys it and is not content without it or otherwise there is that in which the nature of man is satisfyd and which alone must be his good if that in which the nature of man is satisfyd and can rest contented be alone his good then he is a fool who follows that with earnestness as his good which a man can be without and yet be satisfyd and contented in the same manner is he a fool who flies that earnestly as his ill which a man may endure and yet be easy and contented now a man may possibly not have burnt a temple as erostratus and yet may be contented or tho he may not have con shaftesbury  0      querd the world as alexander yet he may be     easy and contented as he may still without any of those advantages of power riches or renown if his fancy hinders not in short we shall find that without any one of those which are commonly calld goods a man may be contented as on the contrary he may possess them all and still be discontented and not a jot the happier if so it follows that happiness is from within not from without a good fancy is the main and thus you see i agree with you opinion all in what sense  that opinion is all in all—but what is this philocles which has seizd you you seem of a sudden grown deeply thoughtful to tell you truth said i i was considering what woud become of me if after all i shoud by your means turn philosopher the change truly woud be somewhat extraordinary replyd theocles but be not concernd the danger is not so great and experience shews us every day that for talking or writing philosophy people are not at all the nearer being philosophers shaftesbury  0      but said i the very name is a kind of reproach the word idiot stood formerly as the opposite to philosopher but nowadays it means nothing more commonly than the philosopher himself philosophy yet in effect replyd he what else is it we all do in general than philosophize if philosophy be as we take it the study of happiness must not everyone in some manner or other either skilfully or unskilfully philosophize is not every deliberation concerning our main interest every correction of our taste every choice and preference in life to be reckond of this kind for if happiness be not allowd to be from self and from within then either is it from outward things alone or from self and outward things together if from outward things alone shew it us in fact that all men are happy in proportion to these and that no one who possesses them is ever miserable by his own fault—but this it seems hardly anyone will pretend to evince all own the contrary—therefore if happiness be partly from self partly from outward things then     each must be considerd and a certain value set on the concerns shaftesbury  0       of an inward kind and which depend on self alone if so and that i consider how and in what these are to be preferd when and on what occasion they are in season or out of season when properly to take place when to yield whats this after all but to philosophize yet even this still is enough to put one out of the ordinary way of thinking and give one an unhappy turn for business and the world right for this also is to be considerd and well weighd and therefore this still is philosophy to inquire where and in what respect one may be most a loser which are the greatest gains the most profitable exchanges since every thing in this world goes by exchange nothing is had for nothing favour requires courtship interest is made by sollicitation honours are acquird with hazard riches with pains learning and accomplishments by study and application security rest indolence are to be had at other prices they may be thought perhaps to come easy for what hardship is there where is the harm tis only to abate of fame and fortune tis only to wave the point of honour and share somewhat less of interest if this be easy all is well some patience you see is necessary in the case privacy shaftesbury  0    0  must be endurd even obscurity and contempt—such are the conditions and thus everything has its condition power and preferments are to be had at one rate pleasures at another liberty and honesty at another a good mind must be paid for as other things but we had best beware lest perhaps we pay too dear for it let us be assurd we have a good bargain come on then—let us account—what is a mind worth what allowance may one handsomly make for it or what may one well afford it for—if i part with it or abate of it tis not for nothing some value i must needs set upon my liberty some upon my inward character something there is in what we call worth something in sincerity and a sound heart orderly affections generous thoughts and a commanding reason are fair possessions not slightly to be given up i am to consider first what may be their equivalent whether i shall find my account in letting these inward concerns run as     they please or whether i shall not be better securd against fortune by adjusting matters at home rather than by making interest abroad and acquiring first one great friend then another to add still more and more to my estate or qua shaftesbury  0      lity for where am i to take up begin and set the bounds let me hear positively how far i am to go and why no further what is a moderate fortune a competency and those other degrees commonly talkd of where is my anger to stop or how high may i suffer it to rise how far may i engage in love how far give way to ambition how far to other appetites or am i to let all loose are the passions to take their swing and no application to be given to em but all to the outward things they aim at or if any application be requisite say plainly how much to one and how much to the other how far are the appetites to be minded and how far outward things give us the measure and rule see whether this be not to philosophize and whether willingly or unwillingly knowingly or unknowingly directly or indirectly everyone does not as much where then is the difference which manner is the best here lies the question this is what i woud have you weigh and examine but the examination say you is troublesom and i had better be without it who tells you thus your reason you say whose force of necessity you must yield to tell me therefore have you fitly culti shaftesbury  0      vated that reason of yours polishd it bestowd the necessary pains on it and exercisd it on this subject or is it like to determine full as well when unexercisd as when thorowly exercisd or ever so expert consider pray in mathematicks whose is the better reason of the two and fitter to be relyd on the practisers or his who is unpractisd whose in the way of war of policy or civil affairs whose in merchandize law physick—and in morality and life i ask still whose may he not perhaps be allowd the best judg of living who studys life and endeavours to form it by some rule or is he indeed to be esteemd most knowing in the matter who slightly examines it and who accidentally and unknowingly philosophizes ⚓ ✪ thus philocles said he concluding his discourse thus is     philosophy establishd for everyone of necessity must reason concerning his own happiness what his good is and what his ill the question is only who reasons best for even he who rejects this reasoning or deliberating part does it from a certain reason and from a persuasion that this is best shaftesbury  0      by this time we found ourselves insensibly got home our philosophy ended and we
