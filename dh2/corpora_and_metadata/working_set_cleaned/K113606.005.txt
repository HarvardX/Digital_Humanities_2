beautiful and loquacious race of animals that embellish our forests amuse our walks and exclude solitude from our most shady retirements from these man has nothing to fear their pleasures their desires and even their animosities only serve to enliven the general picture of nature and give harmony to meditation  no part of nature appears destitute of inhabitants the woods the waters the depths of the earth have their respective tenants while the yielding air and those tracts of seeming space where man never can ascend are also passed through by multitudes of the most beautiful beings of the creation  every order and rank of animals seems fitted for its situation in life but none more apparently than birds they share in common with the stronger race of quadrupedes the vegetable spoils of the earth are supplied with swiftness to compensate for their want of force and have a faculty of ascending into the air to avoid that power which they cannot oppose  the bird seems formed entirely for a life of escape and every part of the anatomy of the animal seems calculated for swiftness as it is designed to rise upon air all its parts are proportionably light and expand a large surface without solidity  in a comparative view with man their formation seems much ruder and more imperfect and they are in general found incapable of the docility even of quadrupedes indeed what great degree of sagacity can be expected in animals whose eyes are almost as large as their brain however though they fall below quadrupedes in the scale of nature and are less imitative of human endowments yet they hold the next rank and far surpass fishes and insects both in the structure of their bodies and in their sagacity  as in mechanics the most curious instruments are generally the most complicated so it is in anatomy the body of man presents the greatest variety upon dissection quadrupedes less perfectly formed discover their defects in the simplicity of their conformation the mechanism of birds is still less complex fishes are furnished with fewer organs still whilst insects more imperfect than all seem to fill up the chasm that separates animal from vegetable nature of man the most perfect animal there are but three or four species of quadrupedes the kinds are more numerous birds are more various still fishes yet more but insects afford so very great a variety that they elude the search of the most inquisitive pursuer  quadrupedes as was said have some distant resemblance in their internal structure with man but that of birds is entirely dissimilar as they seem chiefly formed to inhabit the empty regions of air all their parts are adapted to their destined situation it will be proper therefore before i give a general history of birds to enter into a slight detail of their anatom and conformation  as to their external parts they seem surprizingly adapted for swiftness of motion the shape of their body is sharp before to pierce and make way through the air it then rises by a gentle swelling to its bulk and falls off in an expansive tail that helps to keep it buoyant while the foreparts are cleaving the air by their sharpness from this conformation they have often been compared to a ship making its way through water the trunk of the body answers to the hold the head to the prow the tail to the rudder and the wings to the oars from whence the poets have adopted the metaphor of remigium alarm when they describe the wavy motion of a bird in flight  what we are called upon next to admire in the external formation of birds is the neat position of the feathers lying all one way answering at once the purposes of warmth speed and security they mostly tend backward and are laid over one another in an exact and regular order armed with warm and soft down next the body and more strongly fortified and curiously closed externally to fence off the injuries of the weather but lest the feathers should spoil by their violent attrition against the air or imbibe the moisture of the atmosphere the animal is furnished with a gland behind containing a proper quantity of oil which can be pressed out by the birds bill and laid smoothly over every feather that wants to be dressed for the occasion this gland is situated on the rump and furnished with an opening or excretory duct about which grows a small tuft of feathers somewhat like a painters pencil when therefore the feathers are shattered or rumpled the bird turning its head backwards with the bill catches hold of the gland and pressing it forces out the oily substance with which it anoints the disjoined parts of the feathers and drawing them out with great assiduity recomposes and places them in due order by which they unite more closely together such poultry however as live for the most part under cover are not furnished with so large a stock of this fluid as those birds that reside in the open air the feathers of an hen for instance are pervious to every shower on the contrary swans geese ducks and all such as nature has directed to live upon the water have their feathers dressed with oil from the very first day of their leaving the shell thus their stock of fluid is equal to the necessity of its consumption their very flesh contracts a flavor from it which renders it in some so very rancid as to make it utterly unfit for food however though it injures the flesh it improves the feathers for all the domestic purposes to which they are usually converted  nor are the feathers with which birds are covered less an object of admiration the shaft of every feather is made proportionably strong but hollow below for strength and lightness and above filled with a pith to feed the growth of vane or beard that springs from the shaft of the feather on either side all these feathers are placed generally according to their length and strength so that the largest and strongest feathers in flight have the greatest share of duty the vane or beard of the feather is formed with equal contrivance and care it consists not of one continued membrane because if this were broken it could not easily be repaired but it is composed of many layers each somewhat in itself resembling a feather and lying against each other in close conjunction toward the shaft of the feather these layers are broad and of a semicircular form to serve for strength and for the closer grafting them one against another when in action toward the outer part of the vane these layers grow slender and taper to be more light on their under side they are thin and smooth but their upper outer edge is parted into two hairy edges each side having a different sort of hairs broad at bottom and slender and bearded above by this mechanism the hooked beards of one layer always lie next the straight beards of the next and by that means lock and hold each other  the next object that comes under consideration in contemplating an animal that flies is the wing the instrument by which this wonderful progression is performed in such birds as fly they are usually placed at that part of the body which serves to poize the whole and support it in a fluid that at first seems so much lighter than itself they answer to the forelegs in quadrupedes and at the extremity of this they have a certain fingerlike appendix which is usually called the bastardwing this instrument of flight is furnished with quills which differ from the common feathers only in their size being larger and also from their springing from the deeper part of the skin their shafts lying almost close to the bone the beards of these quills are broad on one side and more narrow on the other both which contribute to the progressive motion of the bird and the closeness of the wing the manner in which most birds avail themselves of these is first thus they quit the earth with a bound in order to have room for flapping with the wing when they have room for this they strike the body of air beneath the wing with a violent motion and with the whole under surface of the same but then to avoid striking the air with equal violence on the upper side as they rise the wing is instantly contracted so that the animal rises by the impulse till it spreads the wing for a second blow for this reason we always see birds choose to rise against the wind because they have thus a greater body of air on the under than the upper side of the wing for these reasons also large fowls do not rise easily both because they have not sufficient room at first for the motion of their wings and because the body of air does not lie so directly under the wing as they rise  in order to move the wings all birds are furnished with two very strong pectoral muscles which lie on each side of the breast bone the pectoral muscles of quadrupedes are trifling in comparison to those of birds in quadrupedes as well as in man the muscles which move the thighs and hinder parts of the body are by far the strongest while those of the arms are feeble but in birds which make use of their wings the contrary obtains the pectoral muscles that move the wings or arms are of enormous strength while those of the thighs are weak and slender by means of these a bird can move its wings with a degree of strength which when compared to the animals size is almost incredible the flap of a swans wing would break a mans leg and a similar blow from an eagle has been known to lay a man dead in an instant such consequently is the force of the wing and such its lightness as to be inimitable by art no machines that human skill can contrive are capable of giving such force to so light an apparatus the art of flying therefore that has so often and so fruitlessly been sought after must it is feared for ever be unattainable since as man increases the force of his flying machine he must be obliged to increase its weight also  in all birds except nocturnal ones the head is smaller and bears less proportion to the body than in quadrupedes that it may more readily divide the air in flying and make way for the body so as to render its passage more easy their eyes also are more flat and depressed than in quadrupedes a circle of small plates of bone placed scalewise under the outer coat of the organ encompasses the pupil on each to strengthen and defend it from injuries beside this birds have a kind of skin called the nictitating membrane with which like a veil they can at pleasure cover their eyes though their eyelids continue open this membrane takes its rise from the greater or more obtuse corner of the eye and serves to wipe cleanse and probably to moisten its surface the eyes though they outwardly appear but small yet separately each almost equals the brain whereas in man the brain is more than twenty times larger than the orbit of the eye nor is this organ in birds less adapted for vision by a particular expansion of the optic nerve which renders the impressions of external objects more vivid and distinct  from this conformation of the eye it follows that the sense of seeing in birds is infinitely superior to that of other animals indeed this piercing sight seems necessary to the creatures support and safety were this organ blunter from the rapidity of the birds motion it would be apt to strike against every object in its way and it could scarcely find subsistence unless possessed of a power to discern its food from above with astonishing sagacity an hawk for instance perceives a lark at a distance which neither men nor dogs could spy a kite from an almost imperceptible height in the clouds darts down on its prey with the most unerring aim the sight of birds therefore exceeds what we know in most other animals and excels them both in strength and precision  all birds want the external ear standing out from the head they are only furnished with holes that convey sounds to the auditory canal it is true indeed that the horned owl and one or two more birds seem to have external ears but what bears that resemblance are only feathers sticking out on each side of the head but no way necessary to the sense of hearing it is probable however that the feathers encompassing the earholes in birds supply the defect of the exterior ear and collect sounds to be transmitted to the internal sensory the extreme delicacy of this organ is easily proved by the readiness with which birds learn tunes or repeat words and the great exactness of their pronunciation  the sense of smelling seems not less vivid in the generality of birds many of them wind their prey at an immense distance while others are equally protected by this sense against their insidious pursuers in decoys where ducks are caught the men who attend them universally keep a piece of turf burning near their mouths upon which they breathe lest the fowl should smell them and consequently fly away the universality of this practice puts the necessity of it beyond a doubt and proves the extreme delicacy of the sense of smelling at least in this species of the feathered creation  next to the parts for flight let us view the legs and feet ministering to motion they are both made light for the easier transportation through the air the toes in some are webbed to fit them for the waters in others they are separate for the better holding objects or clinging to trees for safety such as have long legs have also long necks as otherwise they would be incapable of gathering up their food either by land or water but it does not hold however that those who have long necks should have long legs since we see that swans and geese whose necks are extremely long have very short legs and these chiefly employed in swimming  thus every external part hitherto noticed appears adapted to the life and situation of the animal nor are the inward parts though less immediately appropriated to flight less necessary to safety the bones of every part of the body are extremely light and thin and all the muscles except that immediately moving the wings extremely slight and feeble the tail which is composed of quill feathers serves to counterbalance the head and neck it guides the animals flight like a rudder and greatly assists it either in its ascent or when descending  if we go on to examine birds internally we shall find the same wonderful conformation fitting them for a life in air and increasing the surface by diminishing the solidity in the first place their lungs which are commonly called the sole stick fast to the sides of the ribs and back and can be very little diluted or contracted but to make up for this which might impede their breathing the ends of the branches of the windpipe open into them while these have openings into the cavity of the belly and convey the air drawn in by breathing into certain receptacles like bladders running along the length of the whole body nor are these openings obscure or difficult to be discerned for a probe thrust into the lungs of a fowl will easily find a passage into the belly and air blown into the windpipe will be seen to distend the animals body like a bladder in quadrupedes this passage is stopped by the midriff but in fowls the communication is obvious and consequently they have a much greater facility of taking a long and large inspiration it is sometimes also seen that the windpipe makes many convolutions within the body of the bird and it is then called the labyrinth but of what use these convolutions are or why the windpipe should make so many turnings within the body of some birds is a difficulty for which no naturalist has been able to account  this difference of the windpipe often obtains in animals that to all appearance are of the same species thus in the tame swan the windpipe makes but a straight passage into the lungs while in the wild swan which to all external appearance seems the same animal the windpipe pierces through the breast bone and there has several turnings before it comes out again and goes to enter the lungs it is not to form the voice that these turnings are found since the fowls that are without them are vocal and those particularly the bird just now mentioned that have them are silent whence therefore some birds derive that loud and various modulation in their warblings is not easily to be accounted for at least the knife of the anatomist goes but a short way in the investigation all we are certain of is that birds have much louder voices in respect to their bulk than animals of any other kind for the bellowing of an ox is not louder than the scream of a peacock  in these particulars birds pretty much resemble each other in their internal conformation but there are some varieties which we should more attentively observe all birds have properly speaking but one stomach but this is very different in different kinds in all the rapacious kinds that live upon animal food as well as in some of the fishfeeding tribe the stomach is peculiarly formed the oesophagus or gullet in them is found replete with glandulous bodies which serves to dilate and macerate the food as it passes into the stomach which is always very large in proportion to the size of the bird and generally wrapped round with fat in order to increase its warmth and powers of digestion  granivorous birds or such as live upon fruits corn and other vegetables have their intestines differently formed from those of the rapacious kind their gullet dilates just above the breast bone and forms itself into a pouch or bag called the crop this is replete with salivary glands which serve to moisten and soften the grain and other food which it contains these glands are very numerous with longitudinal openings which emit a whitish and a viscous substance after the dry food of the bird has been macerated for a convenient time it then passes into the belly where instead of a soft moist stomach as in the rapacious kinds it is ground between two pair of muscles commonly called the gizzard covered on the inside with a stony ridgy coat and almost cartilaginous these coats rubbing against each other are capable of bruising and attenuating the hardest substances their action being often compared to that of the grindingteeth in man and other animals thus the organs of digestion are in a manner reversed in birds beasts grind their food with their teeth and then it passes into the stomach where it is softened and digested on the contrary birds of this sort first macerate and soften it in the crop and then it it is ground and comminuted in the stomach or gizzard birds are also careful to pick up sand gravel and other hard substances not to grind their food as has been supposed but to prevent the too violent action of the coats of the stomach against each other  most birds have two appendices or blind guts which in quadrupedes are always found single among such birds as are thus supplied all carnivorous fowl and all birds of the sparrow kind have very small and short ones waterfowl and birds of the poultry kind the longest of all there is still another appendix observable in the intestines of birds resembling a little worm which is nothing more than the remainder of that passage by which the yolk was conveyed into the guts of the young chicken while yet in the egg and under incubation  the outlet of that duct which conveys the bile into the intestines is in most birds a great way distant from the stomach which may arise from the danger there would be of the bile regurgitating into the stomach in their various rapid motions as we see in men at sea wherefore their biliary duct is so contrived that this regurgitation cannot take place  all birds though they want a bladder for urine have large kidneys and ureters by which this secretion is made and carried away by one common canal birds says harvey as well as serpents which have spongy lungs make but little water because they drink but little they therefore have no need of a bladder but their urine distills down into the common canal designed for receiving the other excrements of the body the urine of birds differs from that of other animals for as there is usually in urine two parts one more serous and liquid the other more thick and gross which subsides to the bottom in birds this part is most abundant and is distinguished from the rest by its white or silver color this part is found not only in the whole intestinal canal but is seen also in the whole channel of the ureters which may be distinguished from the coats of the kidneys by their whiteness this milky substance they have in greater plenty than the more thin and serous part and it is of a middle consistence between limpid urine and the grosser parts of the faeces in passing through the ureters it resembles milk curdled or lightly condensed and being cast forth easily congeals into a chalky crust  from this simple conformation of the animal it should seem that birds are subject to few diseases and in fact they have but few there is one however which they are subject to from which quadrupedes are in a great measure exempt this is the annual molting which they suffer for all birds whatsoever obtain a new covering of feathers once a year and cast the old during the molting season they ever appear disordered those most remarkable for their courage then lose all their fierceness and such as are of a weakly constitution often expire under this natural operation no feeding can maintain their strength they all cease to breed at this season that nourishment which goes to the production of the young is wholly absorbed by the demand required for supplying the nascent plumage  this molting time however may be artificially accelerated and those who have the management of singing birds frequently put their secret in practice they enclose the bird in a dark cage where they keep it excessively warm and throw the poor little animal into an artificial fever this produces the molt his old feathers fall before their time and a new set take place more brilliant and beautiful than the former they add that it mends the birds singing and increases its vivacity but it must not be concealed that scarce one bird in three survives the operation  the manner in which nature performs this operation of molting is thus the quill or feather when first protruded from the skin and come to its full size grows harder as it grows older and receives a kind of periosteum or skin round the shaft by which it seems attached to the animal in proportion as the quill grows older its sides or the bony pen part thicken but its whole diameter shrinks and decreases thus by the thickening of its sides all nourishment from the body becomes more sparing and by the decrease of its diameter it becomes more loosely fixed in its socket till at length it falls out in the mean time the rudiments of an incipient quill are beginning below the skin forms itself into a little bag which is fed from the body by a small vein and artery and which every day increases in size till it is protruded while the one end vegetates into the beard or vane of the feather that part attached to the skin is still soft and receives a constant supply of nourishment which is diffused through the body of the quill by that little light substance which we always find within when we make a pen this substance which as yet has received no name that i know of serves the growing quill as the umbilical artery does an infant in the womb by supplying it with nourishment and diffusing that nourishment over the whole frame when however the quill is come to its full growth and requires no further nourishment the vein and artery become less and less till at last the little opening by which they communicated with the quill becomes wholly obliterated and the quill thus deprived continues in its socket for some months till in the end it shrinks and leaves room for a repetition of the same process of nature as before  the molting season commonly obtains from the end of summer to the middle of autumn the bird continues to struggle with this malady during the winter and nature has kindly provided that when there are the fewest provisions that then the animals appetite shall be least craving at the beginning of spring when food begins again to be plenty the animals strength and vigor return it is then that the abundance of provisions aided by the mildness of the season incite it to love and all nature seems teeming with life and disposed to continue it  chap ii of the generation nestling and incubation of birds the return of spring is the beginning of pleasure those vital spirits which seemed locked up during the winter then begin to expand vegetables and insects supply abundance of food and the bird having more than a sufficiency for its own subsistence is impelled to transfuse life as well as to maintain it those warblings which had been hushed during the colder seasons now begin to animate the fields every grove and bush resounds with the challenge of anger or the call of allurement this delightful concert of the grove which is so much admired by man is no way studied for his amusement it is usually the call of the male to the female his efforts to sooth her during the times of incubation or it is a challenge between two males for the affections of some common favorite  it is by this call that birds begin to pair at the approach of spring and provide for the support of a future progeny the loudest notes are usually from the male while the hen seldom expresses her consent but in a short interrupted twittering this compact at least for the season holds with unbroken faith many birds live with inviolable fidelity together for a constancy and when one dies the other is always seen to share the same fate soon after we must not take our idea of the conjugal fidelity of birds from observing the poultry in our yards whose freedom is abridged and whose manners are totally corrupted by slavery we must look for it in our fields and our forests where nature continues in unadulterated simplicity where the number of males is generally equal to that of females and where every little animal seems prouder of his progeny than pleased with his mate were it possible to compare sensations the male of all wild birds seems as happy in the young brood as the female and all his former caresses all his soothing melodies seem only aimed at that important occasion when they are both to become parents and to educate a progeny of their own producing the pleasures of love appear dull in their effects when compared to the interval immediately after the exclusion of their young they both seem at that season transported with pleasure every action testifies their pride their importance and tender solicitude  when the business of fecundation is performed the female then begins to lay such eggs as have been impregnated by the cock are prolific and such as have not for she lays often without any congress whatsoever continue barren and are only addled by incubation previous however to laying the work of nestling becomes the common care and this is performed with no small degree of assiduity and apparent design it has been asserted that birds of one kind always make their nests in the same manner and of the same materials but the truth is that they vary this as the materials places or climates happen to differ the redbreast in some parts of england makes its nest with oak leaves where they are in greatest plenty in other parts with moss and hair some birds that with us make a very warm nest are less solicitous in the tropical climates where the heat of the weather promotes the business of incubation in general however every species of birds has a peculiar architecture of its own and this adapted to the number of eggs the temperature of the climate or the respective heat of the little animals own body where the eggs are numerous it is then incumbent to make the nest warm that the animal heat may be equally diffused to them all thus the wren and all the small birds make the nest very warm for having many eggs it is requisite to distribute warmth to them in common on the contrary the plover that has but two eggs the eagle and the crow are not so solicitous in this respect as their bodies are capable of being applied to the small number upon which they sit with regard to climate waterfowl that with us make but a very slovenly nest are much more exact in this particular in the colder regions of the north they there take every precaution to make it warm and some kinds strip the down from their breasts to line it with greater security  in general however every bird resorts to hatch in those climates and places where its food is found in greatest plenty and always at that season when provisions are in the greatest abundance the large birds and those of the aquatic kinds choose places as remote from man as possible as their food is in general different from that which is cultivated by human labor some birds which have only the serpent to fear build their nests depending from the end of a small bough and form the entrance from below being thus secured either from the serpent or the monkey tribes but all the little birds which live upon fruits and corn and that are too often unwelcome intruders upon the fruits of human industry in making their nests use every precaution to conceal them from man on the other hand the great birds remote from human society use every precaution to render theirs inaccessible to wild beasts or vermin  nothing can exceed the patience of birds while hatching neither the calls of hunger nor the near approach of danger can drive them from the nest they are often fat upon beginning to sit yet before incubation is over the female is usually wasted to skin and bone ravens and crows while the females are sitting take care to provide them with food and this in great abundance but it is different with most of the smaller kinds during the whole time the male sits near his mate upon some tree and sooths her by his singing and often when she is tired takes her place and patiently continues upon the nest till she returns sometimes however the eggs acquire a degree of heat too much for the purposes of hatching in such cases the hen leaves them to cool a little and then returns to sit with her usual perseverance and pleasure  so great is the power of instinct in animals of this class that they seem driven from one appetite to another and continue almost passive under its influence reason we cannot call it since the first dictates of that principle would be selfpreservation take a brute says addison out of his instinct and you find him wholly deprived of understanding with what caution continues he does the hen provide herself a nest in places unfrequented and free from noise and disturbance when she has laid her eggs in such a manner that she can cover them what care does she take in turning them frequently that all parts may partake of the vital warmth when she leaves them to provide for her necessary sustenance how punctually does she return before they have time to cool and become incapable of producing an animal in the summer you see her giving herself greater freedoms and quitting her care for above two hours together but in winter when the rigor of the season would chill the principles of life and destroy the young one she grows more assiduous in her attendance and stays away but half the time when the birth approaches with how much nicety and attention does she help the chick to break the prison not to take notice of her covering it from the injuries of the weather providing it with proper nourishment and teaching it to help itself nor to mention her forsaking the nest if after the usual time of reckoning the young one does not make its appearance a chemical operation could not be followed with greater art or diligence than is seen in the hatching a chick though there are many birds that show an infinitely greater sagacity yet at the same time the hen that has all this seeming ingenuity which is indeed absolutely necessary for the propagation of the species considered in other respects is without the least glimmerings of thought or common sense she mistakes a piece of chalk for an egg and sits upon it in the same manner she is insensible of any increase or diminution in the number of those she lays she does not distinguish between her own and those of another species and when the birth appears of never so different a bird will cherish it for her own an hen followed by a brood of ducks shall stand affrighted at the edge of the pond trembling for the fate of her young which she sees venturing into so dangerous an element as the different principle which acts in these different animals cannot be termed reason so when we call it instinct we mean something we have no knowledge of it appears to me the immediate direction of providence and such an operation of the supreme being as that which determines all the portions of matter to their proper centers  the production of the young as was said seems to be the great era of a birds happiness nothing can at that time exceed its spirit and industry the most timid becomes courageous in the defense of its young birds of the rapacious kind at this season become more than usually fierce and active they carry their prey yet throbbing with life to the nest and early accustom their young to habits of slaughter and cruelty nor are those of milder natures less busily employed the little birds then discontinue their singing taken up with more important pursuits of common subsistence  while the young are yet unfledged and continue in the nest the old ones take care to provide them with a regular supply and lest one should take all nourishment from the rest they feed each of the young in their turn if they perceive that man has been busy with their nest or has handled the little ones they abandon the place by night and provide their brood a more secure though less commodious retreat when the whole family is fully plumed and capable of avoiding danger by flight they are then led forth when the weather is fine and taught the paternal art of providing for their subsistence they are led to the places where their food lies they are shown the method of discovering or carrying it away and then led back to the nest for a day or two longer at length when they are completely qualified to shift for themselves the old ones take them abroad and leading them to the accustomed places forsake them for the last time and all future connection is ever at an end  those birds which are hatched and sent out earliest in the season are the most strong and vigorous those on the other hand that have been delayed till the midst of summer are more feeble and tender and sometimes incapable of sustaining the rigours of the ensuing winter birds themselves seem sensible of this difference and endeavor to produce early in the spring if however their efforts are obstructed by having their nests robbed or some similar accident they still persevere in their efforts for a progeny and it often happens that some are thus retarded till the midst of winter what number of eggs any bird can lay in the course of a season is not ascertained but this is true that such as would have laid but two or three at the most if their nests be robbed or their eggs stolen will lay above ten or twelve a common hen if moderately fed will lay above an hundred from the beginning of spring to the latter end of autumn in general however it obtains that the smallest and weakest animals are the most prolific while the strong and rapacious are abridged by sterility thus such kinds as are easily destroyed are as readily repaired and nature where she has denied the power of resistance has compensated by the fertility attending procreation  birds in general though they have so much to fear from man and each other are seldom scared away from their usual haunts although they be so perfectly formed for a wandering life and are supplied with powers to satisfy all their appetites though never so remote from the object though they are so well fitted for changing place with ease and rapidity yet the greatest number remain contented in the districts where they have been bred and by no means exert their desires in proportion to their endowments the rook if undisturbed never desires to leave his native grove the blackbird still frequents its accustomed hedge and the redbreast though seemingly mild claims a certain district from whence he seldom moves but drives out every one of the same species from thence without pity they are excited to migration by no other motives but those of fear climate or hunger it must be from one of these powerful motives that the birds which are called birds of passage every year forsake us for some time and make their regular and expected returns  nothing has more employed the curiosity of mankind than these annual emigrations and yet few subjects continue so much involved in darkness it is generally believed that the cause of their retreat from these parts of europe is either a scarcity of food at certain seasons or the want of a secure asylum from the persecution of man during the time of courtship and bringing up their young thus the starling in sweden at the approach of winter finding subsistence no longer in that kingdom descends every year into germany and the hen chaffinches of the same country are seen every year to fly through holland in large flocks to pass their winter in a milder climate others with a more daring spirit prepare for journies that might intimidate even human perseverance thus the quails in spring forsake the burning heats of africa for the milder sun of europe and when they have passed the summer with us steer their slight back to enjoy in egypt the temperate air which then begins to be delightful this with them seems a preconcerted undertaking they unite together in some open place for some days before their departure and by an odd kind of chattering seem to debate on the method to proceed when their plan is resolved upon they all take flight together and often appear in such numbers that to mariners at sea they seem like a cloud that rests upon the horizon the boldest strongest and by far the greatest number make good their intention but many there are who not well apprized of their own force for the undertaking grow weary in the way and quite spent by the fatigues of their flight drop down into the sea and sometimes upon deck thus becoming an easy prey to the mariner  of the vast quantity of waterfowl that frequent our shores it is amazing to reflect how few are known to breed here the cause that principally urges them to leave this country seems to be not merely the want of food but the desire of a secure retreat our country is too populous for birds so shy and timid as the greatest number of these are when great part of our island was a mere waste an uncultivated tract of woods and marshes many species of birds which now migrate remained with us throughout the year the great heron and the crane that have now forsaken this country in former times bred familiarly in our marshes and seemed to animate our fens their nests like those of most clovenfooted waterfowl were built on the ground and exposed to every invader but as rural economy increased these animals were more and more disturbed before they had little to fear as the surrounding marsh defended them from all the carnivorous quadrupedes and their own strength from birds of prey but upon the intrusion of man and by a long series of alarms they have at length been obliged to seek during the summer some lonely habitation at a safe distance from every destroyer  of the numerous tribes of the duck kind we know of no more than five that breed here the tame swan the tame goose the sheldrake the eider duck and a few of the wild ducks the rest contribute to form that amazing multitude of waterfowl which annually repair to the dreary lakes and deserts of lapland from the more southern countries of europe in those extensive and solitary retreats they perform the duties of incubation and nutrition in full security there are few of this kind that may not be traced to the northern deserts to countries of lakes rivers swamps and mountains covered with thick and gloomy forests that afford shelter during summer to the timid animals who live there in undisturbed security in those regions from the thickness of the forests the ground remains moist and penetrable during the summer season the woodcock the snipe and other slender billed birds can there feed at ease while the webfooted birds find more than sufficient plenty of food from the number of insects which swarm there to an incredible degree the days there are long and the beautiful meteorous nights afford them every opportunity of collecting so minute a food which is probably of all others the most grateful we are not to be astonished therefore at the amazing numbers of fowl that descend from these regions at the approach of winter numbers to which the army of xerxes was but trifling in comparison and which linnaeus has observed for eight whole days and nights to cover the surface of the river calix  this migration from the north usually begins in september when they quit their retreats and disperse themselves over all the southern parts of europe it is not unpleasing to observe the order of their flight they generally range themselves in a long line or they sometimes make their march angularly two lines uniting in the center like the letter v reversed the bird which leads at the point seems to cleave the air to facilitate the passage for those which are to follow when fatigued with this laborious station it falls back into one of the wings of the file while another takes its place with us they make their appearance about the beginning of october circulate first round our shores and when compelled by severe frost betake themselves to our lakes and rivers some indeed of the webfooted fowl of hardier constitutions than the rest abide the rigours of their northern climate the whole winter but when the cold reigns there with more than usual severity they are obliged to seek for more southern skies they then repair with the rest for shelter to these kingdoms so that the diver the wild swan and the swallowtailed sheldrake visit our coasts but seldom and that only when compelled by the severity of their winters at home  it has been often a subject of astonishment how animals to all appearance so dull and irrational should perform such long journeys should know whither to steer and when to set out upon such a great undertaking it is probable that the same instinct which governs all their other actions operates also here they rather follow the weather than the country they steer only from colder or warmer climates into those of an opposite nature and finding the variations of the air as they proceed in their favor go on till they find land to repose on it cannot be supposed that they have any memory of the country where they might have spent a former winter it cannot be supposed that they see the country to which they travel from their height in the air since though they mounted for miles the convexity of the globe would intercept their view it must therefore only be that they go on as they continue to perceive the atmosphere more suitable to their present wants and dispositions  all this seems to be pretty plain but there is a circumstance attending the migration of swallows which wraps this subject in great obscurity it is agreed on all hands that they are seen migrating into warmer climates and that in amazing numbers at the approach of the european winter their return into europe is also as well attested about the beginning of summer but we have another account which serves to prove that numbers of them continue torpid here during the winter and like bats make their retreat into old walls the hollow of trees or even sink into the deepest lakes and find security for the winter season by remaining there in clusters at the bottom however this latter circumstance may be their retreat into old walls is too well authenticated to remain a doubt at present the difficulty therefore is to account for this difference in these animals thus variously preparing to encounter the winter it was supposed that in some of them the blood might lose its motion by the cold and that thus they were rendered torpid by the severity of the season but mr buffon having placed many of this tribe in an icehouse found that the same cold by which their blood was congealed was fatal to the animal it remains therefore a doubt to this hour whether there may not be a species of swallows to all external appearance like the rest but differently formed within so as to fit them for a state of insensibility during the winter here it was suggested indeed that the swallows found thus torpid were such only as were too weak to undertake the migration or were hatched too late to join the general convoy but it was upon these that mr buffon tried his experiment it was these that died under the operation  thus there are some birds which by migrating make an habitation of every part of the earth but in general every climate has birds peculiar to itself the feathered inhabitants of the temperate zone are but little remarkable for the beauty of their plumage but then the smaller kinds make up for this defect by the melody of their voices the birds of the torrid zone are very bright and vivid in their colors but they have screaming voices or are totally silent the frigid zone on the other hand where the seas abound with fish are stocked with birds of the aquatic kind in much greater plenty than in europe and these are generally clothed with a warmer coat of feathers or they have large quantities of fat lying underneath the skin which serves to defend them from the rigours of the climate  in all countries however birds are a more longlived class of animals than the quadrupedes or insects of the same climate the life of man himself is but short when compared to what some of them enjoy it is said that swans have been known to live three hundred years geese are often seen to live fourscore while linnets and other little birds though imprisoned in cages are often found to reach fourteen or fifteen how birds whose age of perfection is much more early than that of quadrupedes should yet live comparatively so much longer is not easily to be accounted for perhaps as their bones are lighter and more porous than those of quadrupedes there are fewer obstructions in the animal machine and nature thus finding more room for the operations of life it is carried on to a greater extent  all birds in general are less than quadrupedes that is the greatest of one class far surpass the greatest of the other in magnitude the ostrich which is the greatest of birds bears no proportion to the elephant and the smallest hummingbird which is the least of the class is still far more minute than the mouse in these the extremities of nature are plainly discernible and in forming them she appears to have been doubtful in her operations the ostrich seemingly covered with hair and incapable of flight making near approaches to the quadrupede class while the hummingbird of the size of an humblebee and with a fluttering motion seems nearly allied to the insect  these extremities of this class are rather objects of human curiosity than utility it is the middle order of birds which man has taken care to propagate and maintain of those which he has taken under his protection and which administer to his pleasures or necessities the greatest number seem creatures of his formation the variety of climate to which he consigns them the food with which he supplies them and the purposes for which he employs them produce amazing varieties both in their colors shape magnitude and the taste of their flesh wild birds are for the most part of the same magnitude and shape they still keep the prints of primaeval nature strong upon them except in a few they generally maintain their very color but it is otherwise with domestic animals they change at the will of man  of the tame pigeon for instance it is said that they can be bred to a feather  as we are thus capable of influencing their form and color so also is it frequent to see equal instances of our influencing their habitudes appetites and passions the cock for instance is artificially formed into that courage and activity which he is seen to possess and many birds testify a strong attachment to the hand that feeds them how far they are capable of instruction is manifest to those who have the care of hawks but a still more surprising instance of this was seen some time ago in london a canary bird was taught to pick up the letters of the alphabet at the word of command so as to spell any persons name in company and this the little animal did by motions from its master which were imperceptible to every other spectator upon the whole however they are inferior to quadrupedes in docility and seem more mechanically impelled by all the power of instinct  chap iii of the division of birds though birds are fitted for sporting in air yet as they find their food upon the surface of the earth there seems a variety equal to the different aliments with which it tends to supply them the flat and burning desert the rocky cliff the extensive fen the stormy ocean as well as the pleasing landscape have all their peculiar inhabitants the most obvious distinction therefore of birds is into those that live by land and those that live by water or in other words into land birds and water fowl  it is no difficult matter to distinguish land from water fowl by the legs and toes all land birds have their toes divided without any membrane or web between them and their legs and feet serve them for the purposes of running grasping or climbing on the other hand water fowl have their legs and feet formed for the purposes of wading in water or swimming on its surface in those that wade the legs are usually long and naked in those that swim the toes are webbed together as we see in the feet of a goose which serve like oars to drive them forward with greater velocity the formation therefore of land and water fowl is as distinct as their habits and nature herself seems to offer us this obvious distribution in methodizing animals of the feathered creation  however a distinction so comprehensive goes but a short way in illustrating the different tribes of so numerous a class the number of birds already known amounts to above eight hundred and every person who turns his mind to these kinds of pursuits is every day adding to the catalogue it is not enough therefore to be able to distinguish a land from a water fowl much more is still required to be able to distinguish the different kinds of birds from each other and even the varieties in the same kind when they happen to offer this certainly is a work of great difficulty and perhaps the attainment will not repay the labor the sensible part of mankind will not withdraw all their attention from more important pursuits to give it entirely up to what promises to repay them only with a very confined species of amusement in my distribution of birds therefore i will follow linnaeus in the first sketch of his system and then leave him to follow the most natural distinctions in enumerating the different kinds that admit of an history or require a description  linnaeus divides all birds into six classes namely into birds of the rapacious kind birds of the pie kind birds of the poultry kind birds of the sparrow kind birds of the duck kind and birds of the crane kind the four first comprehend the various kinds of land birds the two last those that belong to the water  birds of the rapacious kind constitute that class of carnivorous fowl that live by rapine he distinguishes them by their beak which is hooked strong and notched at the point by their legs which are short and muscular and made for the purposes of tearing by their toes which are strong and knobbed and their talons which are sharp and crooked by the make of their body which is muscular and their flesh which is impure nor are they less known by their food which consists entirely of flesh their stomach which is membranous and their manners which are fierce and cruel  birds of the pie kind have the bill differing from the former as in those it resembled an hook destined for tearing to pieces in these it resembles a wedge fitted for the purpose of cleaving their legs are formed short and strong for walking their body is slender and impure and their food miscellaneous they nestle in trees and the male feeds the female during the time of incubation  birds of the poultry kind have the bill a little unequal for the purposes of gathering their food the upper chap hangs over the lower their bodies are fat and muscular and their flesh white and pure they live upon grain which is moistened in the crop they make their nest on the ground without art they lay many eggs and use promiscuous venery  birds of the sparrow kind comprehend all that beautiful and vocal class that adorn our fields and groves and gratify every sense in its turn their bills may be compared to a forceps that catches hold their legs are formed for hopping along their bodies are tender pure in such as feed upon grain impure in such as live upon insects they live chiefly in trees their nests are artificially made and their amors are observed with connubial fidelity  birds of the duck kind use their bill as a kind of strainer to their food it is smooth covered with a skin and nervous at the point their legs are short and their feet formed for swimming the toes being webbed together their body is fat inclining to rancidity they live in waters and chiefly build their nests upon land  with respect to the order of birds that belong to the waters those of the crane kind have the bill formed for the purposes of searching and examining the bottom of pools their legs are long and formed for wading their toes are not webbed their thighs are half naked their body is slender and covered with a very thin skin their tail is short and their flesh savoury they live in lakes upon animals and they chiefly build their nests upon the ground  such is the division of linnaeus with respect to this class of animals and at first sight it appears natural and comprehensive but we must not be deceived by appearances the student who should imagine he was making a progress in the history of nature while he was only thus making arbitrary distributions would be very much mistaken should he come to enter deeper into this naturalists plan he would find birds the most unlike in nature thrown together into the same class and find animals joined that entirely differ in climate in habitudes in manners in shape coloring and size in such a distribution for instance he would find the hummingbird and the raven the rail and the ostrich joined in the same family if when he asked what sort of a creature was the hummingbird he were told that it was in the same class with the carrion crow would he not think himself imposed upon in such a case the only way to form any idea of the animal whose history he desires to know is to see it and that curiosity very few have an opportunity of gratifying the number of birds is so great that it might exhaust the patience not only of the writer but the reader to examine them all in the present confined undertaking it would certainly be impossible i will therefore now attach myself to a more natural method and still keeping the general division of linnaeus before me enter into some description of the most noted or the most worth knowing  under one or other class as i shall treat them the reader will probably find all the species and all the varieties that demand his curiosity when the leader of any tribe is described and its history known it will give a very tolerable idea of all the species contained under it it is true the reader will not thus have his knowledge ranged under such precise distinctions nor can he be able to say with such fluency that the rail is of the ostrich class but what is much more material he will have a tolerable history of the bird he desires to know or at least of that which most resembles it in nature  however it may be proper to apprize the reader that he will not here find his curiosity satisfied as in some of the former volumes where we often took mr buffon for our guide those who have hitherto written the natural history of birds have in general been contented with telling their names or describing their toes or their plumage it must often therefore happen that instead of giving the history of a bird we must be content to importune the reader with merely its description i will therefore divide the following history of birds with linnaeus into six parts in the first of which i will give such as brisson has ranged among the rapacious birds next those of the pie kind and thus go on through the succeeding classes till i finish with those of the duck kind but before i enter upon a systematic detail i will beg leave to give the history of three or four birds that do not well range in any system these from their great size are sufficiently distinguishable from the rest and from their incapacity of flying lead a life a good deal differing from the rest of the feathered creation the birds i mean are the ostrich the cassowary the emu the dodo and the solitaire  chap iv the ostrich depiction of the ostrich the ostrich de seve del isc tailor sculp   in beginning with the feathered tribe the first animal that offers seems to unite the class of quadrupedes and of birds in itself while it has the general outline and properties of a bird yet it retains many of the marks of the quadrupede in appearance the ostrich resembles the camel and is almost as tall it is covered with a plumage that resembles hair much more nearly than feathers and its internal parts bear as near a similitude to those of the quadrupede as of the bird creation it may be considered therefore as an animal made to fill up that chasm in nature which separates one class of beings from another  the ostrich is the largest of all birds travelers affirm that they are seen as tall as a man on horseback and even some of those that have been brought into england were above seven feet high the head and bill somewhat resemble those of a duck and the neck may be likened to that of a swan but that it is much longer the legs and thighs resemble those of an hen though the whole appearance bears a strong resemblance to that of a camel but to be more particular it is usually seven feet high from the top of the head to the ground but from the back it is only four so that the head and neck are above three feet long from the top of the head to the rump when the neck is stretched out in a right line it is six feet long and the tail is about a foot more one of the wings without the feathers is a foot and an half and being stretched out with the feathers is three feet  the plumage is much alike in all that is generally black and white though some of them are said to be gray the greatest feathers are at the extremities of the wings and tail and the largest are generally white the next row is black and white and of the small feathers on the back and belly some are white and others black there are no feathers on the sides nor yet on the thighs nor under the wings the lower part of the neck about half way is covered with still smaller feathers than those on the belly and back and those like the former also are of different colors  all these feathers are of the same kind and peculiar to the ostrich for other birds have several sorts some of which aresoft and downy and others hard and strong ostrich feathers are almost all as soft as down being utterly unfit to serve the animal for flying and still less adapted to be a proper defense against external injury the feathers of other birds have the webs broader on one side than the other but those of the ostrich have their shaft exactly in the middle the upper part of the head and neck are covered with a very fine clear white hair that shines like the bristles of a hog and in some places there are small tufts of it consisting of about twelve hairs which grow from a single shaft about the thickness of a pin  at the end of each wing there is a kind of spur almost like the quill of a porcupine it is an inch long being hollow and of an horny substance there are two of these on each wing the largest of which is at the extremity of the bone of the wing and the other a foot lower the neck seems to be more slender in proportion to that of other birds from its not being furnished with feathers the skin in this part is of a livid flesh color which some improperly would have to be blue the bill is short and pointed and two inches and an half at the beginning the external form of the eye is like that of a man the upper eyelid being adorned with eyelashes which are longer than those on the lid below the tongue is small very short and composed of cartilages ligaments and membranes intermixed with fleshy fibers in some it is about an inch long and very thick at the bottom in others it is but half an inch being a little forked at the end  the thighs are very fleshy and large being covered with a white skin inclining to redness and wrinkled in the manner of a net whose meshes will admit the end of a finger some have very small feathers here and there on the thighs and others again have neither feathers nor wrinkles what are called the legs of birds in this are covered before with large scales the end of the foot is cloven and has two very large toes which like the leg are covered with scales these toes are of unequal sizes the largest which is on the inside is seven inches long including the claw which is near three fourths of an inch in length and almost as broad the other toe is but four inches long and is without a claw  the internal parts of this animal are formed with no less surprising peculiarity at the top of the breast under the skin the fat is two inches thick and on the forepart of the belly it is as hard as suet and about two inches and an half thick in some places it has two distinct stomachs the first which is lowermost in its natural situation somewhat resembles the crop in other birds but it is considerably larger than the other stomach and is furnished with strong muscular fibers as well circular as longitudinal the second stomach or gizzard has outwardly the shape of the stomach of a man and upon opening is always found filled with a variety of discordant substances hay grass barley beans bones and stones some of which exceed in size a pullets egg the kidneys are eight inches long and two broad and differ from those of other birds in not being divided into lobes the heart and lungs are separated by a midriff as in quadrupedes and the parts of generation also bear a very strong resemblance and analogy  such is the structure of this animal forming the shade that unites birds and quadrupedes and from this structure its habits and manners are entirely peculiar it is a native only of the torrid regions of africa and has long been celebrated by those who have had occasion to mention the animals of that region its flesh is proscribed in scripture as unfit to be eaten and most of the ancient writers describe it as well known in their times like the race of the elephant it is transmitted down without mixture and has never been known to breed out of that country which first produced it it seems formed to live among the sandy and burning deserts of the torrid zone and as in some measure it owes its birth to their genial influence so it seldom migrates into tracts more mild or more fertile as that is the peculiar country of the elephant the rhinoceros and camel so it may readily be supposed capable of affording a retreat to the ostrich they inhabit from preference the most solitary and horrid deserts where there are few vegetables to cloth the surface of the earth and where the rain never comes to refresh it the arabians assert that the ostrich never drinks and the place of its habitation seems to confirm the assertion in these formidable regions ostriches are seen in large flocks which to the distant spectator appear like a regiment of cavalry and have often alarmed a whole caravan there is no desert how barren soever but what is capable of supplying these animals with provision they eat almost every thing and these barren tracts are thus doubly grateful as they afford both food and security the ostrich is of all other animals the most voracious it will devour leather grass hair iron stones or any thing that is given nor are its powers of digestion less in such things as are digestible those substances which the coats of the stomach cannot soften pass whole so that glass stones or iron are excluded in the form in which they were devoured all metals indeed which are swallowed by any animal lose a part of their weight and often the extremities of their figure from the action of the juices of the stomach upon their surface a quarter pistole which was swallowed by a duck lost seven grains of its weight in the gizzard before it was voided and it is probable that a still greater diminution of weight would happen in the stomach of an ostrich considered in this light therefore this animal may be said to digest iron but such substances seldom remain long enough in the stomach of any animal to undergo so tedious a dissolution however this be the ostrich swallows almost every thing presented to it whether this be from the necessity which smaller birds are under of picking up gravel to keep the coats of their stomach asunder or whether it be from a want of distinguishing by the taste what substances are fit and what incapable of digestion certain it is that in the ostrich dissected by ranby there appeared such a quantity of heterogeneous substances that it was wonderful how any animal could digest such an overcharge of nourishment valisnieri also found the first stomach filled with a quantity of incongruous substances grass nuts cords stones glass brass copper iron tin lead and wood a piece of stone was found among the rest that weighed more than a pound he saw one of these animals that was killed by devouring a quantity of quicklime it would seem that the ostrich is obliged to fill up the great capacity of its stomach in order to be at ease but that nutritious substances not occurring it pours in whatever offers to supply the void  in their native deserts however it is probable they live chiefly upon vegetables where they lead an inoffensive and social life the male as thevenot assures us assorting with the female with connubial fidelity they are said to be very much inclined to venery and the make of the parts in both sexes seems to confirm the report it is probable also they copulate like other birds by compression and they lay very large eggs some of them being above five inches in diameter and weighing above fifteen pounds these eggs have a very hard shell somewhat resembling those of the crocodile except that those of the latter are less and rounder  the season for laying depends on the climate where the animal is bred in the northern parts of africa this season is about the beginning of july in the south it is about the latter end of december these birds are very prolific and lay generally from forty to fifty eggs at one clutch it has been commonly reported that the female deposits them in the sand and covering them up leaves them to be hatched by the heat of the climate and then permits the young to shift for themselves very little of this however is true no bird has a stronger affection for her young than the ostrich nor none watches her eggs with greater assiduity it happens indeed in those hot climates that there is less necessity for the continual incubation of the female and she more frequently leaves her eggs which are in no fear of being chilled by the weather but though she sometimes forsakes them by day she always carefully broods over them by night and kolben who has seen great numbers of them at the cape of good hope affirms that they sit on their eggs like other birds and that the male and female take this office by turns as he had frequent opportunities of observing nor is it more true what is said of their forsaking their young after they are excluded the shell on the contrary the young ones are not even able to walk for several days after they are hatched during this time the old ones are very assiduous in supplying them with grass and very careful to defend them from danger nay they encounter every danger in their defense it was a way of taking them among the ancients to plant a number of sharp stakes round the ostrichs nest in her absence upon which she pierced herself at her return the young when brought forth are of an ash color the first year and are covered with feathers all over but in time these feathers drop and those parts which are covered assume a different and more becoming plumage  the beauty of a part of this plumage particularly the long feathers that compose the wings and tail is the chief reason that man has been so active in pursuing this harmless bird to its deserts and hunting it with no small degree of expense and labor the ancients used those plumes in their helmets the ladies of the east make them an ornament in their dress and among us our undertakers and our fine gentlemen still make use of them to decorate their hearses and their hats those feathers which are plucked from the animal while alive are much more valued than those taken when dead the latter being dry light and subject to be wormeaten  beside the value of their plumage some of the savage nations of africa hunt them also for their flesh which they consider as a dainty they sometimes also breed these birds tame to eat the young ones of which the female is said to be the greatest delicacy some nations have obtained the name of struthophagi or ostricheaters from their peculiar fondness for this food and even the romans themselves were not averse to it apicius gives us a receipt for making sauce for the ostrich and heliogabalus is noted for having dressed the brains of six hundred ostriches in one dish for it was his custom never to eat but of one dish in a day but that was an expensive one even among the europeans now the eggs of the ostrich are said to be well tasted and extremely nourishing but they are too scarce to be fed upon although a single egg be a sufficient entertainment for eight men  as the spoils of the ostrich are thus valuable it is not to be wondered at that man has become their most assiduous pursuer for this purpose the arabians train up their best and fleetest horses and hunt the ostrich still in view perhaps of all other varieties of the chase this though the most laborious is yet the most entertaining as soon as the hunter comes within sight of his prey he puts on his horse with a gentle gallop so as to keep the ostrich still in sight yet not so as to terrify him from the plain into the mountains of all known animals that make use of their legs in running the ostrich is by far the swiftest upon observing himself therefore pursued at a distance he begins to run at first but gently either insensible of his danger or sure of escaping in this situation he somewhat resembles a man at full speed his wings like two arms keep working with a motion correspondent to that of his legs and his speed would very soon snatch him from the view of his pursuers but unfortunately for the silly creature instead of going off in a direct line he takes his course in circles while the hunters still make a small course within relieve each other meet him at unexpected turns and keep him thus still employed still followed for two or three days together at last spent with fatigue and famine and finding all power of escape impossible he endeavors to hide himself from those enemies he cannot avoid and covers his head in the sand or the first thicket he meets sometimes however he attempts to face his pursuers and though in general the most gentle animal in nature when driven to desperation he defends himself with his beak his wings and his feet such is the force of his motion that a man would be utterly unable to withstand him in the shock  the struthophagi have another method of taking this bird they cover themselves with an ostrichs skin and passing up an arm through the neck thus counterfeit all the motions of this animal by this artifice they approach the ostrich which becomes an easy prey he is sometimes also taken by dogs and nets but the most usual way is that mentioned above  when the arabians have thus taken an ostrich they cut its throat and making a ligature below the opening they shake the bird as one would rinse a barrel then taking off the ligature there runs out from the wound in the throat a considerable quantity of blood mixed with the fat of the animal and this is considered as one of their greatest dainties they next flea the bird and of the skin which is strong and thick sometimes make a kind of vest which answers the purposes of a cuirass and a buckler  there are others who more compassionate or more provident do not kill their captive but endeavor to tame it for the purposes of supplying those feathers which are in so great request the inhabitants of dara and lybia breed up whole flocks of them and they are tamed with very little trouble but it is not for their feathers alone that they are prized in this domestic state they are often ridden upon and used as horses moore assures us that at joar he saw a man traveling upon an ostrich and adanson asserts that at the factory of podore he had two ostriches which were then young the strongest of which ran swifter than the best english racer although he carried two negroes on his back as soon as the animal perceived that it was thus loaded it set off running with all its force and made several circuits round the village till at length the people were obliged to stop it by barring up the way how far this strength and swiftness may be useful to mankind even in a polished state is a matter that perhaps deserves enquiry posterity may avail themselves of this creatures abilities and riding upon an ostrich may one day become the favorite as it most certainly is the swiftest mode of conveyance  the parts of this animal are said to be convertible to many salutary purposes in medicine the fat is said to be emollient and relaxing that while it relaxes the tendons it fortifies the nervous system and being applied to the region of the loins it abates the pains of the stone in the kidney the shell of the egg powdered and given in proper quantities is said to be useful in promoting urine and dissolving the stone in the bladder the substance of the egg itself is thought to be peculiarly nourishing however galen in mentioning this asserts that the eggs of hens and pheasants are good to be eaten those of geese and ostriches are the worst of all  chap v the emu of this bird which many call the american ostrich but little is certainly known it is an inhabitant of the new continent and the travelers who have mentioned it seem to have been more solicitous in proving its affinity to the ostrich than in describing those peculiarities which distinguish it from all others of the feathered creation  it is chiefly found in guiana along the banks of the oroonoko in the inland provinces of brasil and chili and the vast forests that border on the mouth of the river plata many other parts of south america were known to have them but as men multiplied these large and timorous birds either fell beneath their superior power or fled from their vicinity  the emu though not so large as the ostrich is only second to it in magnitude it is by much the largest bird in the new continent and is generally found to be six feet high measuring from its head to the ground its legs are three feet long and its thigh is near as thick as that of a man the toes differ from those of the ostrich as there are three in the american bird and but two in the former its neck is long its head small and the bill flatted like that of the ostrich but in all other respects it more resembles a cassowary a large bird to be described hereafter the form of the body appears round the wings are short and entirely unfitted for flying and it entirely wants a tail it is covered from the back and rump with long feathers which fall backward and cover the anus these feathers are gray upon the back and white on the belly it goes very swiftly and seems assisted in its motion by a kind of tubercle behind like an heel upon which on plain ground it treads very securely in its course it uses a very odd kind of action lifting up one wing which it keeps elevated for a time till letting it drop it lifts up the other what the birds intention may be in thus keeping only one wing up is not easy to discover whether it makes use of this as a sail to catch the wind or whether as a rudder to turn its course in order to avoid the arrows of the indians yet remains to be ascertained however this be the emu runs with such a swiftness that the fleetest dogs are thrown out in the pursuit one of them finding itself surrounded by the hunters darted among the dogs with such fury that they made way to avoid its rage and it escaped by its amazing velocity in safety to the mountains  as this bird is but little known so travelers have given a loose to their imaginations in describing some of its actions which they were conscious could not be easily contradicted this animal says nierenberg is very peculiar in the hatching of its young the male compels twenty or thirty of the females to lay their eggs in one nest he then when they have done laying chases them away and places himself upon the eggs however he takes the singular precaution of laying two of the number aside which he does not sit upon when the young ones come forth these two eggs are addled which the male having foreseen breaks one and then another upon which multitudes of flies are found to settle and these supply the young brood with a sufficiency of provision till they are able to shift for themselves  on the other hand wafer asserts that he has seen great quantities of this animals eggs on the desert shores north of the river plata where they were buried in the sand in order to be hatched by the heat of the climate both this as well as the preceding account may be doubted and it is more probable that it was the crocodiles eggs which wafer had seen which are undoubtedly hatched in that manner  when the young ones are hatched they are familiar and follow the first person they meet i have been followed myself says wafer by many of these young ostriches which at first are extremely harmless and simple but as they grow older they become more cunning and distrustful and run so swift that a greyhound can scarcely overtake them their flesh in general is good to be eaten especially if they be young it would be no difficult matter to rear up flocks of these animals tame particularly as they are naturally so familiar and they might be found to answer domestic purposes like the hen or the turkey their maintenance could not be expensive if as narborough says they live entirely upon grass  chap vi the cassowary the cassowary is a bird which was first brought into europe by the dutch from java in the east indies in which part of the world it is only to be found next to the preceding it is the largest and the heaviest of the feathered species  the cassowary though not so large as the former yet appears more bulky to the eye its body being nearly equal and its neck and legs much thicker and stronger in proportion this conformation gives it an air of strength and force which the fierceness and singularity of its countenance conspire to render formidable it is five feet and an half long from the point of the bill to the extremity of the claws the legs are two feet and an half high from the belly to the end of the claws the head and neck together are a foot and an half and the largest toe including the claw is five inches long the claw alone of the least toe is three inches and a half in length the wing is so small that it does not appear it being hid under the feathers of the back in other birds a part of the feathers serve for flight and are different from those that serve for merely covering but in the cassowary all the feathers are of the same kind and outwardly of the same color they are generally double having two long shafts which grow out of a short one which is fixed in the skin those that are double are always of an unequal length for some are fourteen inches long particularly on the rump while others are not above three the beards that adorn the stem or shaft are from about half way to the end very long and as thick as an horse hair without being subdivided into fibers the stem or shaft is flat shining black and knotted below and from each knot there proceeds a beard likewise the beards at the end of the large feathers are perfectly black and toward the root of a gray tawny color shorter more soft and throwing out fine fibers like down so that nothing appears except the ends which are hard and black because the other part composed of down is quite covered there are feathers on the head and neck but they are so short and thinly sown that the birds skin appears naked except toward the hinder part of the head where they are a little longer the feathers which adorn the rump are extremely thick but do not differ in other respects from the rest excepting their being longer the wings when they are deprived of their feathers are but three inches long and the feathers are like those on other parts of the body the ends of the wings are adorned with five prickles of different lengths and thickness which bend like a bow these are hollow from the roots to the very points having only that slight substance within which all quills are known to have the longest of these prickles is eleven inches and it is a quarter of an inch in diameter at the root being thicker there than toward the extremity the point seems broken off  the part however which most distinguishes this animal is the head which though small like that of an ostrich does not fail to inspire some degree of terror it is bare of feathers and is in a manner armed with an helmet of horny substance that covers it from the root of the bill to near half the head backwards this helmet is black before and yellow behind its substance is very hard being formed by the elevation of the bone of the skull and it consists of several plates one over another like the horn of an ox some have supposed that this was shed every year with the feathers but the most probable opinion is that it only exfoliates slowly like the beak to the peculiar oddity of this natural armor may be added the color of the eye in this animal which is a bright yellow and the globe being above an inch and an half in diameter give it an air equally fierce and extraordinary at the bottom of the upper eyelid there is a row of small hairs over which there is another row of black hair which look pretty much like an eyebrow the lower eyelid which is the largest of the two is furnished also with plenty of black hair the hole of the ear is very large and open being only covered with small black feathers the sides of the head about the eye and ear being destitute of any covering are blue except the middle of the lower eyelid which is white the part of the bill which answers to the upper jaw in other animals is very hard at the edges above and the extremity of it like that of a turkeycock the end of the lower mandible is slightly notched and the whole is of a greyish brown except a green spot on each side as the beak admits a very wide opening this contributes not a little to the birds menacing appearance the neck is of a violet color inclining to that of slate and it is red behind in several places but chiefly in the middle about the middle of the neck before at the rise of the large feathers there are two processes formed by the skin which resemble somewhat the gills of a cock but that they are blue as well as red the skin which covers the forepart of the breast on which this bird leans and rests is hard callous and without feathers the thighs and legs are covered with feathers and are extremely thick strong straight and covered with scales of several shapes but the legs are thicker a little above the foot than in any other place the toes are likewise covered with scales and are but three in number for that which should be behind is wanting the claws are of a hard solid substance black without and white within  the internal parts are equally remarkable the cassowary unites with the double stomach of animals that live upon vegetables the short intestines of those that live upon flesh the intestines of the cassowary are thirteen times shorter than those of the ostrich the heart is very small being but an inch and an half long and an inch broad at the base upon the whole it has the head of a warrior the eye of a lion the defense of a porcupine and the swiftness of a courser  thus formed for a life of hostility for terrifying others and for its own defense it might be expected that the cassowary was one of the most fierce and terrible animals of the creation but nothing is so opposite to its natural character nothing so different from the life it is contented to lead it never attacks others and instead of the bill when attacked it rather makes use of its legs and kicks like an horse or runs against its pursuer beats him down and treads him to the ground  the manner of going of this animal is not less extraordinary than its appearance instead of going directly forward it seems to kick up behind with one leg and then making a bound onward with the other it goes with such prodigious velocity that the swiftest racer would be left far behind  the same degree of voraciousness which we perceived in the ostrich obtains as strongly here the cassowary swallows every thing that comes within the capacity of its gullet the dutch assert that it can devour not only glass iron and stones but even live and burning coals without testifying the smallest fear or feeling the least injury it is said that the passage of the food through its gullet is performed so speedily that even the very eggs which it has swallowed whole pass through it unbroken in the same form they went down in fact the alimentary canal of this animal as was observed above is extremely short and it may happen that many kinds of food are indigestible in its stomach as wheat or currants are to man when swallowed whole  the cassowarys eggs are of a gray ash color inclining to green they are not so large nor so round as those of the ostrich they are marked with a number of little tubercles of a deep green and the shell is not very thick the largest of these is found to be fifteen inches round one way and about twelve the other  the southern parts of the most eastern indies seems to be the natural climate of the cassowary his domain if we may so call it begins where that of the ostrich terminates the latter has never been found beyond the ganges while the cassowary is never seen nearer than the islands of banda sumatra java the molucca islands and the corresponding parts of the continent yet even here this animal seems not to have multiplied in any considerable degree as we find one of the kings of java making a present of one of these birds to the captain of a dutch ship considering it as a very great rarity the ostrich that has kept in the desert and unpeopled regions of africa is still numerous and the unrivalled tenant of its own inhospitable climate but the cassowary that is the inhabitant depiction of the cassowary the cassowary martinet del isc tailor sculp of a more peopled and polished region is growing scarcer every day it is thus that in proportion as man multiplies all the savage and noxious animals fly before him at his approach they quit their ancient habitations how adapted soever they may be to their natures and seek a more peaceable though barren retreat where they willingly exchange plenty for freedom and encounter all the dangers of famine to avoid the oppressions of an unrelenting destroyer  chap vii the dodo mankind have generally made swiftness the attribute of birds but the dodo has no title to this distinction instead of exciting the idea of swiftness by its appearance it seems to strike the imagination as a thing the most unwieldy and inactive of all nature its body is massive almost round and covered with gray feathers it is just barely supported upon two short thick legs like pillars while its head and neck rise from it in a manner truly grotesque the neck thick and pursy is joined to the head which consists of two great chaps that open far behind the eyes which are large black and prominent so that the animal when it gapes seems to be all mouth the bill therefore is of an extraordinary length not flat and broad but thick and of a bluish white sharp at the end and each chap crooked in opposite directions they resemble two pointed spoons that are laid together by the backs from all this results a stupid and voracious physiognomy which is still more increased by a bordering of feathers round the root of the beak and which give the appearance of an depiction of the dodo dodo e martin sculp hood or cowl and finish this picture of stupid deformity bulk which in other animals implies strength in this only contributes to inactivity the ostrich or the cassowary are no more able to fly than the animal before us but then they supply that defect by their speed in running the dodo seems weighed down by its own heaviness and has scarce strength to urge itself forward it seems among birds what the sloth is among quadrupedes an unresisting thing equally incapable of flight or defense it is furnished with wings covered with soft ashcolored feathers but they are too short to assist it in flying it is furnished with a tail with a few small curled feathers but this tail is disproportioned and displaced its legs are too short for running and its body too fat to be strong one would take it for a tortoise that had supplied itself with the feathers of a bird and that thus dressed out with the instruments of flight it was only still the more unwieldy  this bird is a native of the isle of france and the dutch who first discovered it there called it in their language the nauseous bird as well from its disgusting figure as from the bad taste of its flesh however succeeding observers contradict this first report and assert that its flesh is good and wholesome eating it is a silly simple bird as may very well be supposed from its figure and is very easily taken three or four dodos are enough to dine an hundred men  whether the dodo be the same bird with that which some travelers have described under the bird of nazareth yet remains uncertain the country from whence they both come is the same their incapacity of flying is the same the form of the wings and body in both are similar but the chief difference given is in the color of the feathers which in the female of the bird of nazareth are said to be extremely beautiful and in the length of their legs which in the dodo are short in the other are described as long time and future observation must clear up these doubts and the testimony of a single witness who shall have seen both will throw more light on the subject than the reasonings of an hundred philosophers  chap viii of rapacious birds in general there seems to obtain a general resemblance in all the classes of nature as among quadrupedes a part were seen to live upon the vegetable productions of the earth and another part upon the flesh of each other so among birds some live upon vegetable food and others by rapine destroying all such as such as want force or swiftness to procure their safety by thus peopling the woods with animals of different dispositions nature has wisely provided for the multiplication of life since could we suppose that there were as many animals produced as there were vegetables supplied to sustain them yet there might still be another class of animals formed which could find a sufficient sustenance by feeding upon such of the vegetable feeders as happened to fall by the course of nature by this contrivance a greater number will be sustained upon the whole for the numbers would be but very thin were every creature a candidate for the same food thus by supplying a variety of appetites nature has also multiplied life in her productions  in thus varying their appetites nature has also varied the form of the animal and while she has given some an instinctive passion for animal food she has also furnished them with powers to obtain it all landbirds of the rapacious kinds are furnished with a large head and a strong crooked beak notched at the end for the purpose of tearing their prey they have strong short legs and sharp crooked talons for the purpose of seizing it their bodies are formed for war being fibrous and muscular and their wings for swiftness of flight being well feathered and expansive the sight of such as prey by day is astonishingly quick and such as ravage by night have their sight so fitted as to see objects in darkness with extreme precision  their internal parts are equally formed for the food they seek for their stomach is simple and membranous and wrapped in fat to increase the powers of digestion and their intestines are short and glandular as their food is succulent and juicy they want no length of intestinal tube to form it into proper nourishment their food is flesh which does not require a slow digestion to be converted into a similitude of substance to their own  thus formed for war they lead a life of solitude and rapacity they inhabit by choice the most lonely places and the most desert mountains they make their nests in the clefts of rocks and on the highest and most inaccessible trees of the forest whenever they appear in the cultivated plain or the warbling grove it is only for the purposes of depredation and are gloomy intruders on the general joy of the landscape they spread terror wherever they approach all that variety of music which but a moment before enlivened the grove at their appearing is instantly at an end every order of lesser birds seek for safety either by concealment or flight and some are even driven to take protection with man to avoid their less merciful pursuers  it would indeed be fatal to all the smaller race of birds if as they are weaker than all they were also pursued by all but it is contrived wisely for their safety that every order of carnivorous birds seek only for such as are of the size most approaching their own the eagle flies at the bustard or the pheasant the sparrowhawk pursues the thrush and the linnet nature has provided that each species should make war only on such as are furnished with adequate means of escape the smallest birds avoid their pursuers by the extreme agility rather than the swiftness of their flight for every order would soon be at an end if the eagle to its own swiftness of wing added the versality of the sparrow  another circumstance which tends to render the tyranny of these animals more supportable is that they are less fruitful than other birds breeding but few at a time those of the larger kind seldom produce above four eggs often but two those of the smaller kinds never above six or seven the pigeon it is true that is their prey never breeds above two at a time but then she breeds every month in the year the carnivorous kinds only breed annually and of consequence their fecundity is small in comparison  as they are fierce by nature and are difficult to be tamed so this fierceness extends even to their young which they force from the nest sooner than birds of the gentler kind other birds seldom forsake their young till able completely to provide for themselves the rapacious kinds expel them from the nest at a time when they still should protect and support them this severity to their young proceeds from the necessity of providing for themselves all animals that by the conformation of their stomach and intestines are obliged to live upon flesh and support themselves by prey though they may be mild when young soon become fierce and mischievous by the very habit of using those arms with which they are supplied by nature as it is only by the destruction of other animals that they can subsist they become more furious every day and even the parental feelings are overpowered in their general habits of cruelty if the power of obtaining a supply be difficult the old ones soon drive their brood from the nest to shift for themselves and often destroy them in a fit of fury caused by hunger  another effect of this natural and acquired severity is that almost all birds of prey are unsociable it has long been observed by aristotle that all birds with crooked beaks and talons are solitary like quadrupedes of the cat kind they lead a lonely wandering life and are united only in pairs by that instinct which overpowers their rapacious habits of enmity with all other animals as the male and female are often necessary to each other in their pursuits so they sometimes live together but except at certain seasons they most usually prowl alone and like robbers enjoy in solitude the fruits of their plunder  all birds of prey are remarkable for one singularity for which it is not easy to account all the males of these birds are about a third less and weaker than the females contrary to what obtains among quadrupedes among which the males are always the largest and boldest from thence the male is called by falconers a tarcel that is a tierce or third less than the other the reason of this difference cannot proceed from the necessity of a larger body in the female for the purposes of breeding and that her volume is thus increased by the quantity of her eggs for in other birds that breed much faster and that lay in much greater proportion such as the hen the duck or the pheasant the male is by much the largest of the two whatever be the cause certain it is that the females as willoughby expresses it are of greater size more beautiful and lovely for shape and colors stronger more fierce and generous than the males whether it may be that it is necessary for the female to be thus superior as it is incumbent upon her to provide not only for herself but her young ones also  these birds like quadrupedes of the carnivorous kind are all lean and meagre their flesh is stringy and illtasted soon corrupting and tinctured with the flavor of that animal food upon which they subsist nevertheless belonius asserts that many people admire the flesh of the vulture and falcon and dress them for eating when they meet with any accident that unfits them for the chase he asserts that the osprey a species of the eagle when young is excellent food but he contents himself with advising us to breed these birds up for our pleasure rather in the field than for the table  of land birds of a rapacious nature there are five kinds the eagle kind the hawk kind the vulture kind the horned the screech owl kind the distinctive marks of this class are taken from their claws and beak their toes are separated their legs are feathered to the heel their toes are four in number three before one behind their beak is short thick and crooked  the eagle kind is distinguished from the rest by his beak which is straight till toward the end when it begins to hook downwards  the vulture kind is distinguished by the head and neck he is without feathers  the hawk kind by the beak being hooked from the very root  the horned owl by the feathers at the base of the bill standing forwards and by some feathers on the head that stand out resembling horns  the screech owl by the feathers at the base of the bill standing forward and being without horns  a description of one in each kind will serve for all the rest  chap ix the eagle and its affinities depiction of the eagle the eagle de seve del isc tailor sculp   the golden eagle is the largest and the noblest of all those birds that have received the name of eagle it weighs above twelve pounds its length is three feet the extent of its wings seven feet four inches the bill is three inches long and of a deep blue color and the eye of an hazel color the sight and sense of smelling are very acute the head and neck are clothed with narrow sharp pointed feathers and of a deep brown color bordered with tawny but those on the crown of the head in very old birds turn gray the whole body above as well as beneath is of a dark brown and the feathers of the back are finely clouded with a deeper shade of the same the wings when clothed reach to the end of the tail the quill feathers are of a chocolate color the shafts white the tail is of a deep brown irregularly barred and blotched with an obscure ash color and usually white at the roots of the feathers the legs are yellow short and very strong being three inches in circumference and feathered to the very feet the toes are covered with large scales and armed with the most formidable claws the middle of which are two inches long  in the rear of this terrible bird follow the the ring tailed eagle the common eagle the bald eagle the white eagle the koughfooted eagle the erne the black eagle the osprey the seaeagle and the crowned eagle these and others that might be added form different shades in this fierce family but have all the same rapacity the same general form the same habits and the same manner of bringing up their young  in general these birds are found in mountainous and illpeopled countries and breed among the loftiest cliffs they choose those places which are remotest from man upon whose possessions they but seldom make their depredations being contented rather to follow the wild game in the forest than to risque their safety to satisfy their hunger  this fierce animal may be considered among birds as the lion among quadrupedes and in many respects they have a strong similitude to each other they are both possessed of force and an empire over their fellows of the forest equally magnanimous they disdain smaller plunder and only pursue animals worthy the conquest it is not till after having been long provoked by the cries of the rook or the magpie that this generous bird thinks fit to punish them with death the eagle also disdains to share the plunder of another bird and will take up with no other prey but that which he has acquired by his own pursuits how hungry soever he may be he never stoops to carrion and when satiated he never returns to the same carcass but leaves it for other animals more rapacious and less delicate than he solitary like the lion he keeps the desert to himself alone it is as extraordinary to see two pair of eagles in the same mountain as two lions in the same forest they keep separate to find a more ample supply and consider the quantity of their game as the best proof of their dominion nor does the similitude of these animals stop here they have both sparkling eyes and nearly of the same color their claws are of the same form their breath equally strong and their cry equally loud and terrifying bred both for war they are enemies of all society alike fierce proud and incapable of being easily tamed it requires great patience and much art to tame an eagle and even though taken young and brought under by long assiduity yet still it is a dangerous domestic and often turns its force against its master when brought into the field for the purposes of fowling the falconer is never sure of its attachment that innate pride and love of liberty still prompt it to regain its native solitudes and the moment the falconer sees it when let loose first stoop toward the ground and then rise perpendicularly into the clouds he gives up all his former labor for lost quite sure of never beholding his late prisoner more sometimes however they are brought to have an attachment for their feeder they are then highly serviceable and liberally provide for his pleasures and support when the falconer lets them go from his hand they play about and hover round him till their game presents which they see at an immense distance and pursue with certain destruction  of all animals the eagle flies highest and from thence the ancients have given him the epithet of the bird of heaven of all others also he has the quickest eye but his sense of smelling is far inferior to that of the vulture he never pursues therefore but in sight and when he has seized his prey he stoops from his height as if to examine its weight always laying it on the ground before he carries it off as his wing is very powerful yet as he has but little suppleness in the joints of the leg he finds it difficult to rise when down however if not instantly pursued he finds no difficulty in carrying off geese and cranes he also carries away hares lambs and kids and often destroys fawns and calves to drink their blood and carries a part of their flesh to his retreat infants themselves when left unattended have been destroyed by these rapacious creatures which probably gave rise to the fable of ganymedes being snatched up by an eagle to heaven  an instance is recorded in scotland of two children being carried off by eagles but fortunately they received no hurt by the way and the eagles being pursued the children were restored unhurt out of the nests to the affrighted parents  the eagle is thus at all times a formidable neighbor but peculiarly when bringing up its young it is then that the female as well as the male exert all their force and industry to supply their young smith in his history of kerry relates that a poor man in that country got a comfortable subsistence for his family during a summer of famine out of an eagles nest by robbing the eaglets of food which was plentifully supplied by the old ones he protracted their assiduity beyond the usual time by clipping the wings and retarding the flight of the young and very probably also as i have known myself by so tying them as to increase their cries which is always found to increase the parents dispatch to procure them provision it was lucky however that the old eagles did not surprise the countryman as he was thus employed as their resentment might have been dangerous  it happened some time ago in the same country that a peasant resolved to rob the nest of an eagle that had built in a small island in the beautiful lake of killarney he accordingly stripped and swam in upon the island while the old ones were away and robbing the nest of its young he was preparing to swim back with the eaglets tied in a string but while he was yet up to his chin in the water the old eagles returned and missing their young quickly fell upon the plunderer and in spite of all his resistance dispatched him with their beaks and talons  in order to extirpate these pernicious birds there is a law in the orkney islands which entitles any person that kills an eagle to a hen out of every house in the parish in which the plunderer is killed  the nest of the eagle is usually built in the most inaccessible cliff of the rock and often shielded from the weather by some jutting crag that hangs over it sometimes however it is wholly exposed to the winds as well sideways as above for the nest is flat though built with great labor it is said that the same nest serves the eagle during life and indeed the pains bestowed in forming it seems to argue as much one of these was found in the peak of derbyshire which willoughby thus describes it was made of great sticks resting one end on the edge of a rock the other on two birchtrees upon these was a layer of rushes and over them a layer of heath and upon the heath rushes again upon which lay one young one and an addle egg and by them a lamb a hare and three heathpouts the nest was about two yards square and had no hollow in it the young eagle was of the shape of a goshawk of almost the weight of a goose rough footed or feathered down to the foot having a white ring about the tail such is the place where the female eagle deposits her eggs which seldom exceed two at a time in the larger species and not above three in the smallest it is said that she hatches them for thirty days but frequently even of this small number of eggs a part is addled and it is extremely rare to find three eaglets in the same nest it is asserted that as soon as the young ones are somewhat grown the mother kills the most feeble or the most voracious if this happens it must proceed only from the necessities of the parent who is incapable of providing for their support and is content to sacrifice a part to the welfare of all  the plumage of the eaglets is not so strongly marked as when they come to be adult they are at first white then inclining to yellow and at last of light brown age hunger long captivity and diseases make them whiter it is said they live above an hundred years and that they at last die not of old age but from the beaks turning inward upon the under mandible and thus preventing their taking any food they are equally remarkable says mr penant for their longevity and for their power of sustaining a long absence from food one of this species which has now been nine years in the possession of mr owen holland of conway lived thirtytwo years with the gentleman who made him a present of it but what its age was when the latter received it from ireland is unknown the same bird also furnishes a proof of the truth of the other remark having once through the neglect of servants endured hunger for twentyone days without any sustenance whatever  those eagles which are kept tame are fed with every kind of flesh whether fresh or corrupting and when there is a deficiency of that bread or any other provision will suffice it is very dangerous approaching them if not quite tame and they sometimes send forth a loud piercing lamentable cry which renders them still more formidable the eagle drinks but seldom and perhaps when at liberty not at all as the blood of his prey serves to quench his thirst his excrements are always soft and moist and tinged with that whitish substance which as was said before mixes in birds with the urine  such are the general characteristics and habitudes of the eagle however in some these habitudes differ as the sea eagle and the osprey live chiefly upon fish and consequently build their nests on the seashore and by the sides of rivers on the ground among reeds and often lay three or four eggs rather less than those of a hen of a white eliptical form they catch their prey which is chiefly fish by darting down upon them from above the italians compare the violent descent of these birds on their prey to the fall of lead into water and call them aquilla piombina or the leaden eagle  nor is the bald eagle which is an inhabitant of north carolina less remarkable for habits peculiar to itself these birds breed in that country all the year round when the eaglets are just covered with down and a sort of white wooly feathers the female eagle lays again these eggs are left to be hatched by the warmth of the young ones that continue in the nest so that the flight of one brood makes room for the next that are but just hatched these birds fly very heavily so that they cannot overtake their prey like others of the same denomination to remedy this they often attend a sort of fishinghawk which they pursue and strip the plunderer of its prey this is the more remarkable as this hawk flies swifter than they these eagles also generally attend upon fowlers in the winter and when any birds are wounded they are sure to be seized by the eagle though they may fly from the fowler this bird will often also steal young pigs and carry them alive to the nest which is composed of twigs sticks and rubbish it is large enough to fill the body of a cart and is commonly full of bones half eaten and putrid flesh the stench of which is intolerable  the distinctive marks of each species are as follow  the golden eagle of

condor of america we might now come to speak of the vulture kind as they hold the next rank to the eagle but we are interrupted in our method by the consideration of an enormous bird whose place is not yet ascertained as naturalists are in doubt whether to refer it to the eagle tribe or to that of the vulture its great strength force and vivacity might plead for its place among the former the baldness of its head and neck might be thought to degrade it among the latter in this uncertainty it will be enough to describe the bird by the lights we have and leave future historians to settle its rank in the feathered creation indeed if size and strength combined with rapidity of flight and rapacity deserve preeminence no bird can be put in competition with it  the condor possesses in an higher degree than the eagle all the qualities that render it formidable not only to the feathered kind but to beasts and even to man himself acosta garcilasso and desmarchais assert that it is eighteen feet across the wings extended the beak is so strong as to pierce the body of a cow and two of them are able to devour it they do not even abstain from man himself but fortunately there are but few of the species for if they had been plenty every order of animals must have carried on an unsuccessful war against them the indians assert that they will carry off a deer or a young calf in their talons as eagles would an hare or a rabbit that their sight is piercing and their air terrible that they seldom frequent the forests as they require a large space for the display of their wings but that they are found on the seashore and the banks of rivers whither they descend from their heights of the mountains by later accounts we learn that they come down to the seashore only at certain seasons when their prey happens to fail them upon land that they then feed upon dead fish and such other nutritious substances as the sea throws up on the shore we are assured however that their countenance is not so terrible as the old writers have represented it but that they appear of a milder nature than either the eagle or the vulture  condamine has frequently seen them in several parts of the mountains of quito and observed them hovering over a flock of sheep and he thinks they would at a certain time have attempted to carry one off had they not been scared away by the shepherds labat acquaints us that those who have seen this animal declare that the body is as large as that of a sheep and that the flesh is tough and as disagreeable as carrion the spaniards themselves seem to dread its depredations and there have been many instances of its carrying off their children  mr strong the master of a ship as he was sailing along the coasts of chili in the thirtythird degree of south latitude observed a bird sitting upon a high cliff near the shore which some of the ships company shot with a leaden bullet and killed they were greatly surprised when they beheld its magnitude for when the wings were extended they measured thirteen feet from one tip to the other one of the quills was two feet four inches long and the barrel or hollow part was six inches and three quarters and an inch and an half in circumference  we have a still more circumstantial account of this amazing bird by p feuillee the only traveller who has accurately described it in the valley of ilo in peru i discovered a condor perched on a high rock before me i approached within gunshot and fired but as my piece was only charged with swanshot the lead was not able sufficiently to pierce the birds feathers i perceived however by its manner of flying that it was wounded and it was with a good deal of difficulty that it flew to another rock about five hundred yards distant on the seashore i therefore charged again with ball and hit the bird under the throat which made it mine i accordingly ran up to seize it but even in death it was terrible and defended itself upon its back with its claws extended against me so that i scarce knew how to lay hold of it had it not been mortally wounded i should have found it no easy matter to take it but i at last dragged it down from the rock and with the assistance of one of the seamen i carried it to my tent to make a colored drawing the wings of this bird which i measured very exactly were twelve feet three inches english from tip to tip the great feathers that were of a beautiful shining black were two feet four inches long the thickness of the beak was proportionable to the rest of the body the length about four inches the point hooked downwards and white at its extremity and the other part was of a jet black a short down of a brown color covered the head the eyes were black and surrounded with a circle of reddish brown the feathers on the breast neck and wings were of a light brown those on the back were rather darker its thighs were covered with brown feathers to the knee the thigh bone was ten inches long the leg five inches the toes were three before and one behind that behind was an inch and an half and the claw with which it was armed was black and three quarters of an inch the other claws were in the same proportion and the leg was covered with black scales as also the toes but in these the scales were larger  these birds usually keep in the mountains where they find their prey they never descend to the seashore but in the rainy season for as they are very sensible of cold they go there for greater warmth though these mountains are situated in the torrid zone the cold is often very severe for a great part of the year they are covered with snow but particularly in winter  the little nourishment which these birds find on the seacoast except when the tempest drives in some great fish obliges the condor to continue there but a short time they usually come to the coast at the approach of evening stay there all night and fly back in the morning    it is doubted whether this animal be proper to america only or whether it may not have been described by the naturalists of other countries it is supposed that the great bird called the rock described by arabian writers and so much exaggerated by fable is but a species of the condor the great bird of tarnassar in the east indies that is larger than the eagle as well as the vulture of senegal that carries off children are probably no other than the bird we have been describing russia lapland and even switzerland and germany are said to have known this animal a bird of this kind was shot in france that weighed eighteen pound and was said to be eighteen feet across the wings however one of the quills was described only as being larger than that of a swan so that probably the breadth of the wings may have been exaggerated since a bird so large would have the quills more than twice as big as those of a swan however this be we are not to regret that it is scarcely ever seen in europe as it appears to be one of the most formidable enemies of mankind in the deserts of pachomac where it is chiefly seen men seldom venture to travel those wild regions are very sufficient of themselves to inspire a secret horror broken precipices  prowling panthers  forests only vocal with the hissing of serpents  and mountains rendered still more terrible by the condor the only bird that ventures to make its residence in those deserted situations  chap xi of the vulture and its affinities depiction of the king of the vultures king vulture the king of the vultures de seve del isc tailor sculp   the first rank in the description of birds has been given to the eagle not because it is stronger or larger than the vulture but because it is more generous and bold the eagle unless pressed by famine will not stoop to carrion and never devours but what he has earned by his own pursuit the vulture on the contrary is indelicately voracious and seldom attacks living animals when it can be supplied with the dead the eagle meets and singly opposes his enemy the vulture if it expects resistance calls in the aid of its kind and basely overpowers its prey by a cowardly combination putrefaction and stench instead of deterring only serves to allure them the vulture seems among birds what the jackall and hyaena are among quadrupedes who prey upon carcasses and root up the dead  vultures may be easily distinguished from all those of the eagle kind by the nakedness of their heads and necks which are without feathers and only covered with a very slight down or a few scattered hairs their eyes are more prominent those of the eagle being buried more in the socket their claws are shorter and less hooked the inside of the wing is covered with a thick down which is different in them from all other birds of prey their attitude is not so upright as that of the eagle and their flight more difficult and heavy  in this tribe we may range the golden the ashcolored and the brown vulture which are inhabitants of europe the spotted and the black vulture of egypt the bearded vulture the brasilian vulture and the king of the vultures of south america they all agree in their nature being equally indolent yet rapacious and unclean  the golden vulture seems to be the foremost of the kind and is in many things like the golden eagle but larger in every proportion from the end of the beak to that of the tail it is four feet and an half and to the claws end fortyfive inches the length of the upper mandible is almost seven inches and the tail twentyseven in length the lower part of the neck breast and belly are of a red color but on the tail it is more faint and deeper near the head the feathers are black on the back and on the wings and tail of a yellowish brown others of the kind differ from this in color and dimensions but they are all stronly marked by their naked heads and beak straight in the beginning but hooking at the point  they are still more strongly marked by their nature which as has been observed is cruel unclean and indolent their sense of smelling however is amazingly great and nature for this purpose has given them two large apertures or nostrils without and an extensive olfactory membrane within their intestines are formed differently from those of the eagle kind for they partake more of the formation of such birds as live upon grain they have both a crop and a stomach which may be regarded as a kind of gizzard from the extreme thickness of the muscles of which it is composed in fact they seem adapted inwardly not only for being carnivorous but to eat corn or whatsoever of that kind comes in their way  this bird which is common in many parts of europe and but too well known on the western continent is totally unknown in england in egypt arabia and many other kingdoms of africa and asia vultures are found in great abundance the inside down of their wing is converted into a very warm and comfortable kind of fur and is commonly sold in the asiatic markets  indeed in egypt this bird seems to be of singular service there are great flocks of them in the neighborhood of grand cairo which no person is permitted to destroy the service they render the inhabitants is the devouring all the carrion and filth of that great city which might otherwise tend to corrupt and putrify the air they are commonly seen in company with the wild dogs of the country tearing a carcass very deliberately together this odd association produces no quarrels the birds and quadrupedes seem to live amicably and nothing but harmony subsists between them the wonder is still the greater as both are extremely rapacious and both lean and bony to a very great degree probably having no great plenty even of the wretched food on which they subsist  in america they lead a life somewhat similar wherever the hunters who there only pursue beasts for the skins are found to go these birds are seen to pursue them they still keep hovering at a little distance and when they see the beast flead and abandoned they call out to each other pour down upon the carcass and in an instant pick its bones as bare and clean as if they had been scraped by a knife  at the cape of good hope in africa they seem to discover a still greater share of dexterity in their methods of carving i have says kolben been often a spectator of the manner in which they have anatomized a dead body i say anatomized for no artist in the world could have done it more cleanly they have a wonderful method of separating the flesh from the bones and yet leaving the skin quite entire upon coming near the carcass one would not suppose it thus deprived of its internal substance till he began to examine it more closely he then finds it literally speaking nothing but skin and bone their manner of performing the operation is this they first make an opening in the belly of the animal from whence they pluck out and greedily devour the entrails then entering into the hollow which they have made they separate the flesh from the bones without ever touching the skin it often happens that an ox returning home alone to its stall from the plow lies down by the way it is then if the vultures perceive it that they fall with fury down and inevitably devour the unfortunate animal they sometimes attempt them grazing in the fields and then to the number of a hundred or more make their attack all at once and together  they are attracted by carrion says catesby from a very great distance it is pleasant to behold them when they are thus eating and disputing for their prey an eagle generally presides at these entertainments and makes them all keep their distance till he has done they then fall too with an excellent appetite and their sense of smelling is so exquisite that the instant a carcass drops we may see the vultures floating in the air from all quarters and come sousing on their prey it is supposed by some that they eat nothing that has life but this is only when they are not able for when they can come at lambs they show no mercy and serpents are their ordinary food the manner of those birds is to perch themselves several together on the old pine and cypresstrees where they continue all the morning for several hours with their wings unfolded nor are they fearful of danger but suffer people to approach them very near particularly when they are eating  the sloth the filth and the voraciousness of these birds almost exceed credibility in the brazils where they are found in great abundance when they light upon a carcass which they have liberty to tear at their ease they so gorge themselves that they are unable to fly but keep hopping along when they are pursued at all times they are a bird of slow flight and unable readily to raise themselves from the ground but when they have overfed they are then utterly helpless but they soon get rid of their burden for they have a method of vomiting up what they have eaten and then they fly off with greater facility  it is pleasant however to be a spectator of the hostilities between animals that are thus hateful or noxious of all creatures the two most at enmity is the vulture of brazil and the crocodile the female of this terrible amphibious creature which in the rivers of that part of the world grows to the size of twentyseven feet lays it eggs to the number of one or two hundred in the sands on the side of the river where they are hatched by the heat of the climate for this purpose she takes every precaution to hide from all other animals the place where she deposes her burden in the mean time a number of vultures or galinassos as the spaniards call them sit silent and unseen in the branches of some neighboring forest and view the crocodiles operations with the pleasing expectations of succeeding plunder they patiently wait till the crocodile has laid the whole number of her eggs till she has covered them carefully under the sand and until she is retired from them to a convenient distance then all together encouraging each other with cries they pour down upon the nest hook up the sand in a moment lay the eggs bare and devour the whole brood without remorse wretched as is the flesh of these animals yet men perhaps when pressed by hunger have been tempted to taste it nothing can be more lean stringy nauseous and unsavory it is in vain that when killed the rump has been cut off in vain the body has been washed and spices used to overpower its prevailing odor it still smells and tastes of the carrion by which it was nourished and sends forth a stench that is insupportable  these birds at least those of europe usually lay two eggs at a time and produce but once a year they make their nests in inaccessible cliffs and in places so remote that it is rare to find them those in our part of the world chiefly reside in the places where they breed and seldom come down into the plains except when the snow and ice in their native retreats has banished all living animals but themselves they then come from their heights and brave the perils they must encounter in a more cultivated region as carrion is not found at those seasons in sufficient quantity or sufficiently remote from man to sustain them they prey upon rabbits hares serpents and whatever small game they can overtake or overpower  such are the manners of this bird in general but there is one of the kind called the king of the vultures which from its extraordinary figure deserves a separate description this bird is a native of america and not of the east indies as those who make a trade of showing birds would induce us to believe this bird is larger than a turkeycock but is chiefly remarkable for the odd formation of the skin of the head and neck which is bare this skin arises from the base of the bill and is of an orange color from whence it stretches on each side to the head from thence it proceeds like an indented comb and falls on either side according to the motion of the head the eyes are surrounded by a red skin of a scarlet color and the iris has the color and luster of pearl the head and neck are without feathers covered with a fleshcoloured skin on the upper part a fine scarlet behind the head and a duskier colored skin before farther down behind the head arises a little tuft of black down from whence issues and extends beneath the throat on each side a wrinkled skin of a brownish color mixed with blue and reddish behind below upon the naked part of the neck is a collar formed by soft longish feathers of a deep ash color which surround the neck and cover the breast before into this collar the bird sometimes withdraws its whole neck and sometimes a part of its head so that it looks as if it had withdrawn the neck into the body those marks are sufficient to distinguish this bird from all others of the vulture kind and it cannot be doubted but that it is the most beautiful of all this deformed family however neither its habits nor instincts vary from the rest of the tribe being like them a slow cowardly bird living chiefly upon rats lizards and serpents and upon carrion or excrement when it happens in the way the flesh is so bad that even savages themselves cannot abide it  chap xii of the falcon kind and its affinities every creature becomes more important in the history of nature in proportion as it is connected with man in this view the smallest vegetable or the most seemingly contemptible insect is a subject more deserving attention than the most flourishing tree or the most beautiful of the feathered creation in this view the falcon is a more important animal than the eagle or the vulture and though so very diminutive in the comparison is notwithstanding from its connection with our pleasures a much more interesting object of curiosity  the amusement of hawking indeed is now pretty much given over in this kingdom for as every country refines as its enclosures become higher and closer those rural sports must consequently decline in which the game is to be pursued over a long extent of country and where while every thing retards the pursuer below nothing can stop the object of his pursuit above  falconry that is now so much disused among us was the principal amusement of our ancestors a person of rank scarce stirred out without his hawk on his hand which in old paintings is the criterion of nobility harold afterward king of england when he went on a most important embassy into normandy is drawn in an old basrelief as embarking with a bird on his fist and a dog under his arm in those days it was thought sufficient for noblemens sons to wind the horn and to carry their hawk fair and leave study and learning to the children of meaner people indeed this diversion was in such high esteem among the great all over europe that frederic one of the emperors of germany thought it not beneath him to write a treatise upon hawking  the expense which attended this sport was very great among the old welsh princes the kings falconer was the fourth officer in the state but notwithstanding all his honors he was forbid to take more than three draughts of beer from his horn lest he should get drunk and neglect his duty in the reign of james the first sir thomas monson is said to have given a thousand pounds for a cast of hawks and such was their value in general that it was made felony in the reign of edward the third to steal a hawk to take its eggs even in a persons own ground was punishable with imprisonment for a year and a day together with a fine at the kings pleasure in the reign of elizabeth the imprisonment was reduced to three months but the offender was to lie in prison till he got security for his good behavior for seven years farther in the earlier times the art of gunning was but little practiced and the hawk then was valuable not only for its affording diversion but for its procuring delicacies for the table that could seldom be obtained any other way  of many of the ancient falcons used for this purpose we at this time know only the names as the exact species are so ill described that one may be very easily mistaken for another of those in use at present both here and in other countries are the gyrfalcon the falcon the lanner the sacre the hobby the kestril and the merlin these are called the longwinged hawks to distinguish them from the gosshawk the sparrow hawk the kite and the buzzard that are of shorter wing and either too slow too cowardly too indolent or too obstinate to be serviceable in contributing to the pleasures of the field  the generous tribe of hawks as was said are distinguished from the rest by the peculiar length of their wings which reach nearly as low as the tail in these the first quill of the wing is nearly as long as the second it terminates in a point which begins to diminish from about an inch of its extremity this sufficiently distinguishes the generous breed from that of the baser race of kites sparrowhawks and buzzards in whom the tail is longer than the wings and the first feather of the wing is rounded at the extremity they differ also in the latter having the fourth feather of the wing the longest in the generous race it is always the second  this generous race which have been taken into the service of man are endowed with natural powers that the other kinds are not possessed of from the length of their wings they are swifter to pursue their game from a confidence in this swiftness they are bolder to attack it and from an innate generosity they have an attachment to their feeder and consequently a docility which the baser birds are strangers to  the gyrfalcon leads in this bold train he exceeds all other falcons in the largeness of his size for he approaches nearly to the magnitude of the eagle the top of the head is flat and of an ash color with a strong thick short and blue beak the feathers of the back and wings are marked with black spots in the shape of an heart he is a courageous and fierce bird nor fears even the eagle himself but he chiefly flies at the stork the heron and the crane he is mostly found in the colder regions of the north but loses neither his strength nor his courage when brought into the milder climates  the falcon properly so called is the second in magnitude and fame there are some varieties in this bird but there seem to be only two that claim distinction the falcon gentil and the peregrine faulcon both are much less than the gyr and somewhat about the size of a raven they differ but slightly and perhaps only from the different states they were in when brought into captivity those differences are easier known by experience than taught by description the falcon gentil moults in march and often sooner the peregrine falcon does not moult till the middle of august the peregrine is stronger in the shoulder has a larger eye and yet more sunk in the head his beak is stronger his legs longer and the toes better divided  next in size to these is the lanner a bird now very little known in europe then follows the sacre the legs of which are of a bluish color and serve to distinguish that bird to them succeeds the hobby used for smaller game for daring larks and stooping at quails the kestril was trained for the same purposes and lastly the merlin which though the smallest of all the hawk or falcon kind and not much larger than a thrush yet displays a degree of courage that renders him formidable even to birds ten times his size he has often been known to kill a partridge or a quail at a single pounce from above  some of the other species of sluggish birds were now and then trained to this sport but it was when no better could be obtained but these just described were only considered as birds of the nobler races their courage in general was such that no bird not very much above their own size could terrify them their swiftness so great that scarce any bird could escape them and their docility so remarkable that they obeyed not only the commands but the signs of their master they remained quietly perched upon his hand till their game was flushed or else kept hovering round his head without ever leaving him but when he gave permission the common falcon is a bird of such spirit that like a conqueror in a country he keeps all birds in awe and in subjection to his prowse where he is seen flying wild as i often had an opportunity of observing the birds of every kind that seemed entirely to disregard the kite or the sparrowhawk fly with screams at his most distant appearance long before i could see the falcon i have seen them with the utmost signs of terror endeavoring to avoid him and like the peasants of a country before a victorious army every one of them attempting to shift for himself even the young falcons though their spirit be depressed by captivity will when brought out into the field venture to fly at barnacles and wild geese till being soundly brushed and beaten by those strong birds they learn their error and desist from meddling with such unwieldy game for the future  to train up the hawk to this kind of obedience so as to hunt for his master and bring him the game he shall kill requires no small degree of skill and assiduity numberless treatises have been written upon this subject which are now with the sport itself almost utterly forgotten indeed except to a few they seem utterly unintelligible for the falconers had a language peculiar to themselves in which they conversed and wrote and took a kind of professional pride in using no other a modern reader i suppose would be little edified by one of the instructions for instance which we find in willoughby when he bids us draw our falcon out of the mew twenty days before we enseam her if she truss and carry the remedy is to cosse her talons her powse and petty single  but as it certainly makes a part of natural history to show how much the nature of birds can be wrought upon by harsh or kind treatment i will just take leave to give a short account of the manner of training an hawk divested of those cant words with which men of art have thought proper to obscure their profession  in order to train up a falcon the master begins by clapping on straps upon his legs which are called jesses to which there is fastened a ring with the owners name by which in case he should be lost the finder may know where to bring him back to these also are added little bells which serve to mark the place where he is if lost in the chase he is always carried on the fist and is obliged to keep without sleeping if he be stubborn and attempts to bite his head is plunged into water thus by hunger watching and fatigue he is constrained to submit to having his head covered by a hood or cowl which covers his eyes this troublesome employment continues often for three days and nights without ceasing it rarely happens but at the end of this his necessities and the privation of light make him lose all idea of liberty and bring down his natural wildness his master judges of his being tamed when he permits his head to be covered without resistance and when uncovered he seizes the meat before him contentedly the repetition of these lessons by degrees ensures success his wants being the chief principle of his dependence it is endeavored to increase his appetite by giving him little balls of flannel which he greedily swallows having thus excited the appetite care is taken to satisfy it and thus gratitude attaches the bird to the man who but just before had been his tormentor  when the first lessons have succeeded and the bird shows signs of docility he is carried out upon some green the head is uncovered and by flattering him with food at different times he is taught to jump on the fist and to continue there when confirmed in this habit it is then thought time to make him acquainted with the lure this lure is only a thing stuffed like the bird the falcon is designed to pursue such as an heron a pidgeon or a quail and on this lure they always take care to give him his food it is quite necessary that the bird should not only be acquainted with this but fond of it and delicate in his food when shown it when the falcon has flown upon this and tasted the first morsel some falconers then take it away but by this there is a danger of daunting the bird and the surest method is when he flies to seize it to let him feed at large and this serves as a recompense for his docility the use of this lure is to flatter him back when he has flown in the air which it sometimes fails to do and it is always requisite to assist it by the voice and the signs of the master when these lessons have been long repeated it is then necessary to study the character of the bird to speak frequently to him if he be inattentive to the voice to stint in his food such as do not come kindly or readily to the lure to keep waking him if he be not sufficiently familiar and to cover him frequently with the hood if he fears darkness when the familiarity and the docility of the bird are sufficiently confirmed on the green he is then carried into the open fields but still kept fast by a string which is about twenty yards long he is then uncovered as before and the falconer calling him at some paces distance shows him the lure when he flies upon it he is permitted to take a large morsel of the food which is tied to it the next day the lure is shown him at a greater distance till he comes at last to fly to it at the utmost length of his string he is then to be shown the game itself alive but disabled or tame which he is designed to pursue after having seized this several times with his string he is then left entirely at liberty and carried into the field for the purposes of pursuing that which is wild at that he flies with avidity and when he has seized it or killed it he is brought back by the voice and the lure  by this method of instruction an hawk may be taught to fly at any game whatsoever but falconers have chiefly confined their pursuit only to such animals as yield them profit by the capture or pleasure in the pursuit the hare the partridge and the quail repay the trouble of taking them but the most delightful sport is the falcons pursuit of the heron the kite or the woodlark instead of flying directly forward as some other birds do these when they see themselves threatened by the approach of the hawk immediately take to the skies they fly almost perpendicularly upward while their ardent pursuer keeps pace with their flight and tries to rise above them thus both diminish by degrees from the gazing spectator below till they are quite lost in the clouds but they are soon seen descending struggling together and using every effort on both sides the one of rapacious insult the other of desperate defense the unequal combat is soon at an end the falcon comes off victorious and the other killed or disabled is made a prey either to the bird or the sportsman  as for other birds they are not so much pursued as they generally fly straight forward by which the sportsman loses sight of the chase and what is still worse runs a chance of losing his falcon also the pursuit of the lark by a couple of merlins is considered to him only who regards the sagacity of the chase as one of the most delightful spectacles this exercise can afford the amusement is to see one of the merlins climbing to get the ascendant of the lark while the other lying low for the best advantage waits the success of its companions efforts thus while the one stoops to strike its prey the other seizes it at its coming down  such is the natural and acquired habits of these birds which of all others have the greatest strength and courage relative to their size while the kite or the gosshawk approach their prey sideways these dart perpendicularly in their wild state upon their game and devour it on the spot or carry it off if not too large for their power of flying they are sometimes seen descending perpendicularly from the clouds from an amazing height and darting down on their prey with inevitable swiftness and destruction  the more ignoble race of birds make up by cunning and assiduity what these claim by force and celerity being less courageous they are more patient and having less swiftness they are better skilled at taking their prey by surprise the kite that may be distinguished from all the rest of this tribe by his forky tail and his slow floating motion seems almost forever upon the wing he appears to rest himself upon the bosom of the air and not to make the smallest effort in flying he lives only upon accidental carnage as almost every bird in the air is able to make good its retreat against him he may be therefore considered as an insiduous thief who only prowls about and when he finds a small bird wounded or a young chicken strayed too far from the mother instantly seizes the hour of calamity and like a famished glutton is sure to show no mercy his hunger indeed often urges him to acts of seeming desperation i have seen one of them fly round and round for a while to mark a clutch of chickens and then on a sudden dart like lightning upon the unresisting little animal and carry it off the hen in vain crying out and the boys hooting and casting stones to scare it from its plunder for this reason of all birds the kite is the good housewifes greatest tormentor and aversion  of all obscene birds the kite is the best known but the buzzard among us is the most plenty he is a sluggish inactive bird and often remains perched whole days together upon the same bough he is rather an assassin than a pursuer and lives more upon frogs mice and insects which he can easily seize than upon birds which he is obliged to follow he lives in summer by robbing the nests of other birds and sucking their eggs and more resembles the owl kind in his countenance than any other rapacious bird of day his figure implies the stupidity of his disposition and so little is he capable of instruction from man that it is common to a proverb to call one who cannot be taught or continues obstinately ignorant a buzzard the honeybuzzard the moorbuzzard and the henharrier are all of this stupid tribe and differ chiefly in their size growing less in the order i have named them the gosshawk and sparrow hawk are what mr willoughby calls short winged birds and consequently unfit for training however injurious they may be to the pidgeonhouse or the sportsman they have been indeed taught to fly at game but little is to be obtained from their efforts being difficult of instruction and capricious in their obedience it has been lately asserted however by one whose authority is respectable that the sparrowhawk is the boldest and the best of all others for the pleasure of the chase  chap xii the butcherbird before i conclude this short history of rapacious birds that prey by day i must take leave to describe a tribe of smaller birds that seem from their size rather to be classed with the harmless order of the sparrowkind but that from their crooked beak courage and appetites for slaughter certainly deserve a place here the lesser butcherbird is not much above the size of a lark that of the smallest species is not so big as a sparrow yet diminutive as these little animals are they make themselves formidable to birds of four times their dimensions  the greater butcher bird is about as large as a thrush its bill is black an inch long and hooked at the end this mark together with its carnivorous appetites ranks it among the rapacious birds at the same time that its legs and feet which are slender and its toes formed somewhat differently from the former would seem to make it the shade between such birds as live wholly upon flesh and such as live chiefly upon insects and grain  indeed its habits seem entirely to correspond with its conformation as it is found to live as well upon flesh as upon insects and thus to partake in some measure of a double nature however its appetite for flesh is the most prevalent and it never takes up with the former when it can obtain the latter this bird therefore leads a life of continual combat and opposition as from its size it does not much terrify the smaller birds of the forest so it very frequently meets birds willing to try its strength and it never declines the engagement  it is wonderful to see with what intrepidity this little creature goes to war with the pie the crow and the kestril all above four times bigger than itself and that sometimes prey upon flesh in the same manner it not only fights upon the defensive but often comes to the attack and always with advantage particularly when the male and female unite to protect their young and to drive away the more powerful birds of rapine at that season they do not wait the approach of their invader it is sufficient that they see him preparing for the assault at a distance it is then that they sally forth with loud cries wound him on every side and drive him off with such fury that he seldom ventures to return to the charge in these kinds of disputes they generally come off with the victory though it sometimes happens that they fall to the ground with the bird they have so fiercely fixed upon and the combat ends with the destruction of the assailant as well as the defender  for this reason the most redoubtable birds of prey respect them while the kite the buzzard and the crow seems rather to fear than seek the engagement nothing in nature better displays the respect paid to the claims of courage than to see this little bird apparently so contemptible fly in company with the lanner the falcon and all the tyrants of the air without fearing their power or avoiding their resentment  as for small birds they are its usual food it seizes them by the throat and strangles them in an instant when it has thus killed the bird or insect it is asserted by the best authority that it fixes them upon some neighboring thorn and when thus spitted pulls them to pieces with its bill it is supposed that as nature has not given this bird strength sufficient to tear its prey to pieces with its feet as the hawks do it is obliged to have recourse to this extraordinary expedient  during summer such of them as constantly reside here for the smaller red butcherbird migrates remain among the mountainous parts of the country but in winter they descend into the plains and nearer human habitations the larger kind make their nests on the highest trees while the lesser build in bushes in the fields and hedgerows they both lay about six eggs of a white color but encircled at the bigger end with a ring of brownish red the nest on the outside is composed of white moss interwoven with long grass within it is well lined with wool and is usually fixed among the forking branches of a tree the female feeds her young with caterpillars and other insects while very young but soon after accustoms them to flesh which the male procures with surprising industry their nature also is very different from other birds of prey in their parental care for so far from driving out their young from the nest to shift for themselves they keep them with care and even when adult they do not forsake them but the whole brood live in one family together each family lives apart and is generally composed of the male female and five or six young ones these all maintain peace and subordination among each other and hunt in concert upon the returning season of courtship this union is at an end the family parts for ever each to establish a little household of its own it is easy to distinguish these birds at a distance not only from their going in companies but also from their manner of flying which is always up and down seldom direct or sideways  of these birds there are three or four different kinds but the greater ashcolored butcherbird is the least known among us the red backed butcherbird migrates in autumn and does not return till spring the woodchat resembles the former except in the color of the back which is brown and not red as in the other there is still another less than either of the former found in the marshes near london this too is a bird of prey although not much bigger than a titmouse an evident proof that an animals courage or rapacity does not depend upon its size of foreign birds of this kind there are several but as we know little of their manner of living we will not instead of history substitute mere description in fact the colors of a bird which is all we know of them would afford a reader but small entertainment in the enumeration nothing can be more easy than to fill volumes with the different shades of a birds plumage but these accounts are written with more pleasure than they are read and a single glance of a good plate or a picture imprints a juster idea than a volume could convey  chap xiii of rapacious birds of the owl kind that prey by night hitherto we have been describing a tribe of animals who though plunderers among their fellows of the air yet wage war boldly in the face of day we now come to a race equally cruel and rapacious but who add to their savage disposition the further reproach of treachery and carry on all their depredations by night  all birds of the owl kind may be considered as nocturnal robbers who unfitted for taking their prey while it is light surprise it at those hours of rest when the tribes of nature are in the least expectation of an enemy thus there seems no link in natures chain broken no where a dead inactive repose but every place every season every hour of the day and night is bustling with life and furnishing instances of industry selfdefence and invasion  all birds of the owl kind have one common mark by which they are distinguished from others their eyes are formed for seeing better in the dusk than in the broad glare of sunshine as in the eyes of tigers and cats that are formed for a life of nocturnal depredation there is a quality in the retina that takes in the rays of light so copiously as to permit their seeing in places almost quite dark so in these birds there is the same conformation of that organ and though like us they cannot see in a total exclusion of light yet they are sufficiently quicksighted at times when we remain in total obscurity in the eyes of all animals nature has made a complete provision either to shut out too much light or to admit a sufficiency by the contraction and dilatation of the pupil in these birds the pupil is capable of opening very wide or shutting very close by contracting the pupil the brighter light of the day which would act too powerfully upon the sensibility of the retina is excluded by dilating the pupil the animal takes in the more faint rays of the night and thereby is enabled to spy its prey and catch it with greater facility in the dark beside this there is an irradiation on the back of the eye and the very iris itself has a faculty of reflecting the rays of light so as to assist vision in the gloomy places where these birds are found to frequent  but though owls are dazzled by too bright a daylight yet they do not see best in the darkest nights as some have been apt to imagine it is in the dusk of the evening or the gray of the morning that they are best fitted for seeing at those seasons when there is neither too much light nor too little it is then that they issue from their retreats to hunt or to surprise their prey which is usually attended with great success it is then that they find all other birds asleep or preparing for repose and they have only to seize the most unguarded  the nights when the moon shines are the times of their most successful plunder for when it is wholly dark they are less qualified for seeing and pursuing their prey except therefore by moonlight they contract the hours of their chase and if they come out at the approach of dusk in the evening they return before it is totally dark and then rise by twilight the next morning to pursue their game and to return in like manner before the broad daylight begins to dazzle them with its splendour  yet the faculty of seeing in the night or of being entirely dazzled by day is not alike in every species of these nocturnal birds some see by night better than others and some are so little dazzled by daylight that they perceive their enemies and avoid them the common white or barn owl for instance sees with such exquisite acuteness in the dark that though the barn has been shut at night and the light thus totally excluded yet it perceives the smallest mouse that peeps from its hole on the contrary the brown horn owl is often seen to prowl along the hedges by day like the sparrowhawk and sometimes with good success  all birds of the owl kind may be divided into two sorts those that have horns and those without these horns are nothing more than two or three feathers that stand up on each side of the head over the ear and give this animal a kind of horned appearance of the horned kind is the great horned owl which at first view appears as large as an eagle when he comes to be observed more closely however he will be found much less his legs body wings and tail are shorter his head much larger and thicker his horns are composed of feathers that rise above two inches and an half high and which he can erect or depress at pleasure his eyes are large and transparent encircled with an orangecoloured iris his ears are large and deep and it would appear that no animal was possessed with a more exquisite sense of hearing his plumage is of a reddish brown marked on the back with black and yellow spots and yellow only upon the belly  next to this is the common horned owl of a much smaller size than the former and with horns much shorter as the great owl was five feet from the tip of one wing to the other this is but three the horns are but about an inch long and consist of six feathers variegated with black and yellow  there is still a smaller kind of the horned owl which is not much larger than a blackbird and whose horns are remarkably short being composed but of one feather and that not above half an inch high  to these succeeds the tribe without horns the howlet which is the largest of this kind with dusky plumes and black eyes the screech owl of a smaller size with blue eyes and plumage of an iron gray the white owl about as large as the former with yellow eyes and whitish plumage the great brown owl less than the former with brown plumage and a brown beak and lastly the little brown owl with yellowish colored eyes and an orangecoloured bill to this catalogue might be added others of foreign denominations which differ but little from our own if we except the harfang or great hudsons bay owl of edwards which is the largest of all the nocturnal tribe and as white as the snows of the country of which he is a native  all this tribe of animals however they may differ in their size and plumage agree in their general characteristics of preying by night and having their eyes formed for nocturnal vision their bodies are strong and muscular their feet and claws made for tearing their prey and their stomachs for digesting it it must be remarked however that the digestion of all birds that live upon mice lizards or such like food is not very perfect for though they swallow them whole yet they are always seen some time after to disgorge the skin and bones rolled up in a pellet as being indigestible  in proportion as each of these animals bears the daylight best he sets forward earlier in the evening in pursuit of his prey the great horned owl is the foremost in leaving his retreat and ventures into the woods and thickets very soon in the evening the horned and the brown owl are later in their excursions but the barn owl seems to see best in profound darkness and seldom leaves his hiding place till midnight  as they are incapable of supporting the light of the day or at least of then seeing and readily avoiding their danger they keep all this time concealed in some obscure retreat suited to their gloomy appetites and there continue in solitude and silence the cavern of a rock the darkest part of an hollow tree the battlements of a ruined and unfrequented castle some obscure hole in a farmers outhouse are the places where they are usually found if they be seen out of these retreats in the daytime they may be considered as having lost their way as having by some accident been thrown into the midst of their enemies and surrounded with danger  having spent the day in their retreat at the approach of evening they sally forth and skim rapidly up and down along the hedges the barnowl indeed who lives chiefly upon mice is contented to be more stationary he takes his residence upon some shock of corn or the point of some old house and there watches in the dark with the utmost perspicacity and perseverance  nor are these birds by any means silent they all have an hideous note which while pursuing their prey is seldom heard but may be considered rather as a call to courtship there is something always terrifying in this call which is often heard in the silence of midnight and breaks the general pause with an horrid variation it is different in all but in each it is alarming and disagreeable father kircher who has set the voices of birds to music has given all the tones of the owl note which makes a most tremendous melody indeed the prejudices of mankind are united with their sensations to make the cry of the owl disagreeable the screechowls voice was always considered among the people as a presage of some sad calamity that was soon to ensue  they seldom however are heard while they are preying that important pursuit is always attended with silence as it is by no means their intention to disturb or forwarn those little animals they wish to surprise when their pursuit has been successful they soon return to their solitude or to their young if that be the season if however they find but little game they continue their quest still longer and it sometimes happens that obeying the dictates of appetite rather than of prudence they pursue so long that broad day breaks in upon them and leaves them dazzled bewildered and at a distance from home  in this distress they are obliged to take shelter in the first tree or hedge that offers there to continue concealed all day till the returning darkness once more supplies them with a better plan of the country but it too often happens that with all their precaution to conceal themselves they are spied out by the other birds of the place and are sure to receive no mercy the blackbird the thrush the jay the bunting and the redbreast all come in file and employ their little arts of insult and abuse the smallest the feeblest and the most contemptible of this unfortunate birds enemies are then the foremost to injure and torment him they increase their cries and turbulence round him flap him with their wings and are ready to show their courage to be great as they are sensible that their danger is but small the unfortunate owl not knowing where to attack or where to fly patiently sits and suffers all their insults astonished and dizzy he only replies to their mockeries by awkward and ridiculous gestures by turning his head and rolling his eyes with an air of stupidity it is enough that an owl appears by day to set the whole grove into a kind of uproar either the aversion all the small birds have to this animal or the consciousness of their own security makes them pursue him without ceasing while they encourage each other by their mutual cries to lend assistance in this laudable undertaking  it sometimes happens however that the little birds pursue their insults with the same imprudent zeal with which the owl himself had pursued his depredations they hunt him the whole day until evening returns which restoring him his faculties of sight once more he makes the foremost of his pursuers pay dear for their former sport nor is man always an unconcerned spectator here the birdcatchers have got an art of counterfeiting the cry of the owl exactly and having before limed the branches of an hedge they sit unseen and give the call at this all the little birds flock to the place where they expect to find their wellknown enemy but instead of finding their stupid antagonist they are stuck fast to the hedge themselves this sport must be put in practice an hour before nightfall in order to be successful for if it is put off till later those birds which but a few minutes sooner came to provoke their enemy will then fly from him with as much terror as they just before showed insolence  it is not unpleasant to see one stupid bird made in some sort a decoy to deceive another the great horned owl is sometimes made use of for this purpose to lure the kite when falconers desire to catch him for the purposes of training the falcon upon this occasion they clap the tail of a fox to the great owl to render his figure extraordinary in which trim he sails slowly along flying low which is his usual manner the kite either curious to observe this odd kind of animal or perhaps inquisitive to see whether it may not be proper for food flies after and comes nearer and nearer in this manner he continues to hover and sometimes to descend till the falconer setting a strongwinged hawk against him seizes him for the purpose of training his young ones at home  the usual place where the great horned owl breeds is in the cavern of a rock the hollow of a tree or the turret of some ruined castle its nest is near three feet in diameter and composed of sticks bound together by the fibrous roots of trees and lined with leaves on the inside it lays about three eggs which are larger than those of a hen and of a color somewhat resembling the bird itself the young ones are very voracious and the parents not less expert at satisfying the call of hunger the lesser owl of this kind never makes a nest for itself but always takes up with the old nest of some other bird which it has often been forced to abandon it lays four or five eggs and the young are all white at first but change color in about a fortnight the other owls in general build near the place where they chiefly prey that which feeds upon birds in some neighboring grove that which preys chiefly upon mice near some farmers yard where the proprietor of the place takes care to give it perfect security in fact whatever mischief one species of owl may do in the woods the barnowl makes a sufficient recompense for by being equally active in destroying mice nearer home so that a single owl is said to be more serviceable than half a dozen cats in ridding the barn of its domestic vermin in the year    0 says an old writer at hallontide an army of mice so overrun the marshes near southminster that they eat up the grass to the very roots but at length a great number of strange painted owls came and devoured all the mice the like happened again in essex about sixty years after  to conclude our account of these birds they are all very shy of man and extremely indocile and difficult to be tamed the white owl in particular as mr buffon asserts cannot be made to live in captivity i suppose he means if it be taken when old they live says he ten or twelve days in the aviary where they are shut up but they refuse all kind of nourishment and at last die of hunger by day they remain without moving upon the floor of the aviary in the evening they mount on the highest perch where they continue to make a noise like a man snoring with his mouth open this seems designed as a call for their old companions without and in fact i have seen several others come to the call and perch upon the roof of the aviary where they made the same kind of hissing and soon after permitted themselves to be taken in a net  part ii of birds of the poultry kind chap i of birds of the poultry kind from the most rapacious and noxious tribe of birds we make a transition to those which of all others are the most harmless and the most serviceable to man he may force the rapacious tribes to assist his pleasures in the field or induce the smaller warblers to delight him with their singing but it is from the poultry kind that he derives the most solid advantages as they not only make a considerable addition to the necessaries of life but furnish out the greatest delicacies to every entertainment  almost if not all the domestic birds of the poultry kind that we maintain in our yards are of foreign extraction but there are others to be ranked in this class that are as yet in a state of nature and perhaps only wait till they become sufficiently scarce to be taken under the care of man to multiply their propagation it will appear remarkable enough if we consider how much the tame poultry which we have imported from distant climates has increased and how much those wild birds of the poultry kind that have never yet been taken into keeping have been diminished and destroyed they are all thinned and many of the species especially in the more cultivated and populous parts of the kingdom are utterly unseen  under birds of the poultry kind i rank all those that have white flesh and comparatively to their head and limbs have bulky bodies they are furnished with short strong bills for picking up grain which is their chief and often their only sustenance their wings are short and concave for which reason they are not able to fly far they lay a great many eggs and as they lead their young abroad the very day they are hatched in quest of food which they are shown by the mother and which they pick up for themselves they generally make their nests on the ground the toes of all these are united by a membrane as far as the first articulation and then are divided as in those of the former class  under this class we may therefore rank the common cock the peacock the turkey the pintada or guinea hen the pheasant the bustard the grous the partridge and the quail these all bear a strong similitude to each other being equally granivorous fleshy and delicate to the palate these are among birds what beasts of pasture are among quadrupedes peaceable tenants of the field and shunning the thicker parts of the forest that abounds with numerous animals who carry on unceasing hostilities against them  as nature has formed the rapacious class for war so she seems equally to have fitted these for peace rest and society their wings are but short so that they are ill formed for wandering from one region to another their bills are also short and incapable of annoying their opposers their legs are strong indeed but their toes are made for scratching up their food and not for holding or tearing it these are sufficient indications of their harmless nature while their bodies which are fat and fleshy render them unwieldy travelers and incapable of straying far from each other  accordingly we find them chiefly in society they live together and though they may have their disputes like all other animals upon some occasions yet when kept in the same district or fed in the same yard they learn the arts of subordination and in proportion as each knows his strength he seldom tries a second time the combat where he has once been worsted  in this manner all of this kind seem to lead an indolent voluptuous life as they are furnished internally with a very strong stomach commonly called a gizzard so their voraciousness scarce knows any bounds if kept in close captivity and separated from all their former companions they still have the pleasure of eating left and they soon grow fat and unwieldy in their prison to say this more simply many of the wilder species of birds when cooped or caged pine away grow gloomy and some refuse all sustenance whatever none except those of the poultry kind grow fat who seem to lose all remembrance of their former liberty satisfied with indolence and plenty  the poultry kind may be considered as sensual epicures solely governed by their appetites the indulgence of these seems to influence their other habits and destroys among them that connubial fidelity for which most other kinds are remarkable the eagle and the falcon how fierce soever to other animals are yet gentle and true to each other their connexions when once formed continue till death and the male and female in every exigence and every duty lend faithful assistance to each other they assist each other in the production of their young in providing for them when produced and even then though they drive them forth to fight their own battles yet the old ones still retain their former affection to each other and seldom part far asunder  but it is very different with this luxurious class i am now describing their courtship is but short and their congress fortuitous the male takes no heed of his offspring and satisfied with the pleasure of getting leaves to the female all the care of providing for posterity wild and irregular in his appetites he ranges from one to another and claims every female which he is strong enough to keep from his fellows though timorous when opposed to birds of prey yet he is incredibly bold among those of his own kind and but to see a male of his own species is sufficient to produce a combat as his desires extend to all every creature becomes his enemy that pretends to be his rival  the female equally without fidelity or attachment yields to the most powerful she stands by a quiet meretricious spectator of their fury ready to reward the conqueror with every compliance she takes upon herself all the labor of hatching and bringing up her young and chooses a place for hatching as remote as possible from the cock indeed she gives herself very little trouble in making a nest as her young ones are to forsake it the instant they part from the shell  she is equally unassisted in providing for her young that are not fed with meat put into their mouths as in other classes of the feathered kind but peck their food and forsaking their nests run here and there following the parent wherever it is to be found she leads them forward where they are likely to have the greatest quantity of grain and takes care to show by pecking the sort proper for them to seek for though at other times voracious she is then abstemious to an extreme degree and intent only on providing for and showing her young clutch their food she scarce takes any nourishment herself her parental pride seems to overpower every other appetite but that decreases in proportion as her young ones are more able to provide for themselves and then all her voracious habits return  among the other habits peculiar to this class of birds is that of dusting themselves they lie flat in some dusty place and with their wings and feet raise and scatter the dust over their whole body what may be their reason for thus doing it is not easy to explain perhaps the heat of their bodies is such that they require this powder to be interposed between their feathers to keep them from lying too close together and thus increasing that heat with which they are incommoded  chap ii of the cock all birds taken under the protection of man lose a part of their natural figure and are altered not only in their habits but their very form climate food and captivity are three very powerful agents in producing these alterations and those birds that have longest felt their influence under human direction are the most likely to have the greatest variety in their figures their plumage and their dispositions  of all other birds the cock seems to be the oldest companion of mankind to have been first reclaimed from the forest and taken to supply the accidental failure of the luxuries or necessities of life as he is thus longest under the care of man so of all others perhaps he exhibits the greatest number of varieties there being scarce two birds of this species that exactly resemble each other in plumage and form the tail which makes such a beautiful figure in the generality of these birds is yet found entirely wanting in others and not only the tail but the rump also the toes which are usually four in all animals of the poultry kind yet in a species of the cock are found to amount to five the feathers which lie so sleek and in such beautiful order in most of those we are acquainted with are in a peculiar breed all inverted and stand staring the wrong way nay there is a species that comes from japan which instead of feathers seems to be covered over with hair these and many other varieties are to be found in this animal which seem to be the marks this early prisoner bears of his long captivity  it is not well ascertained when the cock was first made domestic in europe but it is generally agreed that we first had him in our western world from the kingdom of persia aristophanes calls the cock the persian bird and tells us he enjoyed that kingdom before some of its earliest monarchs this animal was in fact known so early even in the most savage parts of europe that we are told the cock was one of the forbidden foods among the ancient britons indeed the domestic fowl seems to have banished the wild one persia itself that first introduced it to our acquaintance seems no longer to know it in its natural form and if we did not find it wild in some of the woods of india as well as those of the islands in the indian ocean we might begin to doubt as we do with regard to the sheep in what form it first existed in a state of nature  but those doubts no longer exist the cock is found in the islands of tinian in many others of the indian ocean and in the woods on the coasts of malabar in his ancient state of independance in his wild condition his plumage is black and yellow and his comb and wattles yellow and purple there is another peculiarity also in those of the indian woods their bones which when boiled with us are white as every body knows in those are as black as ebony whether this tincture proceeds from their food as the bones are tinctured red by feeding upon madder i leave to the discussion of others satisfied with the fact let us decline speculation  in their first propagation in europe there were distinctions then that now subsist no longer the ancients esteemed those fowls whose plumage was redish as invaluable but as for the white it was considered as utterly unfit for domestic purposes these they regarded as subject to become a prey to rapacious birds and aristotle thinks them less fruitful than the former indeed his division of those birds seems taken from their culinary uses the one sort he calls generous and noble being remarkable for fecundity the other sort ignoble and useless from their sterility these distinctions differ widely from our modern notions of generosity in this animal that which we call the gamecock being by no means so fruitful as the ungenerous dunghillcock which we treat with contempt the athenians had their cockmatches as well as we but it is probable they did not enter into our refinement of choosing out the most barren of the species for the purposes of combat  however this be no animal in the world has greater courage than the cock when opposed to one of his own species and in every part of the world where refinement and polished manners have not entirely taken place cockfighting is a principal diversion in china india the philipine islands and all over the east cockfighting is the sport and amusement even of kings and princes with us it is declining every day and it is to be hoped it will in time become only the pastime of the lowest vulgar it is the opinion of many that we have a bolder and more valiant breed than is to be found elsewhere and some indeed have entered into a serious discussion upon the cause of so flattering a singularity but the truth is they have cocks in china as bold if not bolder than ours and what would still be considered as valuable among cockers here they have more strength with less weight indeed i have often wondered why men who lay two or three hundred pounds upon the prowess of a single cock have not taken every method to improve the breed nothing it is probable could do this more effectually than by crossing the strain as it is called by a foreign mixture and whether having recourse even to the wild cock in the forests of india would not be useful i leave to their consideration however it is a mean and ungenerous amusement nor would i wish much to promote it the truth is i could give such instructions with regard to cockfighting and could so arm one of these animals against the other that it would be almost impossible for the adversarys cock to survive the first or second blow but as boerhave has said upon a former occasion when he was treating upon poisons to teach the arts of cruelty is equivalent to committing them  this extraordinary courage in the cock is thought to proceed from his being the most salacious of all other birds whatsoever a single cock suffices for ten or a dozen hens and it is said of him that he is the only animal whose spirits are not abated by indulgence but then he soon grows old the radical moisture is exhausted and in three or four years he becomes utterly unfit for the purposes of impregnation hens also to use the words of willoughby as they for the greatest part of the year daily lay eggs cannot suffice for so many births but for the most part after three years become effete and barren for when they have exhausted all their seedeggs of which they had but a certain quantity from the beginning they must necessarily cease to lay there being no new ones generated within  the hen seldom clutches a brood of chickens above once a season though instances have been known in which they produced two the number of eggs a domestic hen will lay in the year are above two hundred provided she be well fed and supplied with water and liberty it matters not much whether she be trodden by the cock or no she will continue to lay although all the eggs of this kind can never by hatching be brought to produce a living animal her nest is made without any care if left to herself a hole scratched into the ground among a few bushes is the only preparation she makes for this season of patient expectation nature almost exhausted by its own fecundity seems to inform her of the proper time for hatching which she herself testifies by a clucking note and by discontinuing to lay the good housewives who often get more by their hens laying than by their chickens often artificially protract this clucking season and sometimes entirely remove it as soon as their hen begins to cluck they stint her in her provisions which if that fails they plunge her into cold water this for the time effectually puts back her hatching but then it often kills the poor bird who takes cold and dies under the operation  if left entirely to herself the hen would seldom lay above twenty eggs in the same nest without attempting to hatch them but in proportion as she lays her eggs are removed and she continues to lay vainly hoping to increase the number in the wild state the hen seldom lays above fifteen eggs but then her provision is more difficultly obtained and she is perhaps sensible of the difficulty of maintaining too numerous a family  when the hen begins to sit nothing can exceed her perseverance and patience she continues for some days immovable and when forced away by the importunities of hunger she quickly returns sometimes also her eggs become too hot for her to bear especially if she be furnished with too warm a nest within doors for then she is obliged to leave them to cool a little thus the warmth of the nest only retards incubation and often puts the brood a day or two back in the shell while the hen sits she carefully turns her eggs and even removes them to different situations till at length in about three weeks the young brood begin to give signs of a desire to burst their confinement when by the repeated efforts of their bill which serves like a pioneer on this occasion they have broke themselves a passage through the shell the hen still continues to sit till all are excluded the strongest and best chickens generally are the first candidates for liberty the weakest come behind and some even die in the shell when all are produced she then leads them forth to provide for themselves her affection and her pride seem then to alter her very nature and correct her imperfections no longer voracious or cowardly she abstains from all food that her young can swallow and flies boldly at every creature that she thinks is likely to do them mischief whatever the invading animal be she boldly attacks him the horse the hog or the mastiff when marching at the head of her little troop she acts the commander and has a variety of notes to call her numerous train to their food or to warn them of approaching danger upon one of these occasions i have seen the whole brood run for security into the thickest part of an hedge while the hen herself ventured boldly forth and faced a fox that came for plunder with a good mastiff however we soon sent the invader back to his retreat but not before he had wounded the hen in several places  ten or twelve chickens are the greatest number that a good hen can rear and clutch at a time but as this bears no proportion to the number of her eggs schemes have been imagined to clutch all the eggs of an hen and thus turn her produce to the greatest advantage by these contrivances it has been obtained that a hen that ordinarily produces but twelve chickens in the year is found to produce as many chickens as eggs and consequently often above two hundred the contrivance i mean is the artificial method of hatching chickens in stoves as is practiced at grand cairo or in a chemical elaboratory properly graduated as has been effected by mr reaumur at grand cairo they thus produce six or seven thousand chickens at a time where as they are brought forth in their mild spring which is warmer than our summer the young ones thrive without clutching but it is otherwise in our colder and unequal climate the little animal may without much difficulty be hatched from the shell but they almost all perish when excluded to remedy this reaumur has made use of a woolen hen as he calls it which was nothing more than putting the young ones in a warm basket and clapping over them a thick woolen canopy i should think a much better substitute might be found and this from among the species themselves capons may very easily be taught to clutch a fresh brood of chickens throughout the year so that when one little colony is thus reared another may be brought to succeed it nothing is more common than to see capons thus employed and the manner of teaching them is this first the capon is made very tame so as to feed from ones hand then about evening they pluck the feathers off his breast and rub the bare skin with nettles they then put the chickens to him which presently run under his breast and belly and probably rubbing his bare skin gently with their heads allay the stinging pain which the nettles had just produced this is repeated for two or three nights till the animal takes an affection to the chickens that have thus given him relief and continues to give them the protection they seek for perhaps also the querulous voice of the chickens may be pleasant to him in misery and invite him to succor the distressed he from that time brings up a brood of chickens like a hen clutching them feeding them clucking and performing all the functions of the tenderest parent a capon once accustomed to this service will not give over but when one brood is grown up he may have another nearly hatched put under him which he will treat with the same tenderness he did the former  the cock from his salaciousness is allowed to be a short lived animal but how long these birds live if left to themselves is not yet well ascertained by any historian as they are kept only for profit and in a few years become unfit for generation there are few that from mere motives of curiosity will make the tedious experiment of maintaining a proper number till they die aldrovandus hints their age to be ten years and it is probable that this may be its extent they are subject to some disorders which it is not our business to describe and as for poisons besides nux vomica which is fatal to most animals except man they are injured as linnaeus asserts by elderberries of which they are not a little fond  chap iii of the peacock the peacock by the common people of italy is said to have the plumage of an angel the voice of a devil and the guts of a thief in fact each of these qualities mark pretty well the nature of this extraordinary bird when it appears with its tail expanded there is none of the feathered creation can vie with it for beauty yet the horrid scream of its voice serves to abate the pleasure we find from viewing it and still more its insatiable gluttony and spirit of depredation make it one of the most noxious domestics that man has taken under his protection  our first peacocks were brought from the east indies and we are assured that they are still found in vast flocks in a wild state in the islands of java and ceylone so beautiful a bird and one esteemed such a delicacy at the tables of the luxurious could not be permitted to continue long at liberty in its distant retreats so early as the days of solomon we find in his navies among the articles imported from the east apes and peacocks aelian relates that they were brought into greece from some barbarous country and were held in such high esteem among them that a male and female were valued at above thirty pounds of our money we are told also that when alexander was in india he found them flying wild in vast numbers on the banks of the river hyarotis and was so struck with their beauty that he laid a severe fine and punishment on all who should kill or disturb them nor are we to be suprized at this as the greeks were so much struck with the beauty of this bird when first brought among them that every person paid a fixed price for seeing it and several people came to athens from lacedemon and thessaly purely to satisfy their curiosity  it was probably first introduced into the west merely on account of its beauty but mankind from contemplating its figure soon came to think of serving it up for a different entainment aufidius hurco stands charged by pliny with being the first who fatted up the peacock for the feasts of the luxurious whatever there may be of delicacy in the flesh of a young peacock it is certain an old one is very indifferent eating nevertheless there is no mention made of choosing the youngest it is probable they were killed indiscriminately the beauty of the feathers in some measure stimulating the appetite hortensius the orator was the first who served them up at an entertainment at rome and from that time they were considered as one of the greatest ornaments of every feast whether the roman method of cookery which was much higher than ours might not have rendered them more palatable than we find them at present i cannot tell but certain it is they talk of the peacock as being the first of viands  its fame for delicacy however did not continue very long for we find in the times of francis the first that it was a custom to serve up peacocks to the tables of the great with an intention not to be eaten but only to be seen their manner was to strip off the skin and then preparing the body with the warmest spices they covered it up again in its former skin with all its plumage in full display and no way injured by the preparation the bird thus prepared was often preserved for many years without corrupting and it is asserted of the peacocks flesh that it keeps longer unputrefied than that of any other animal to give a higher zest to these entertainments on weddings particularly they filled the birds beak and throat with cotton and camphire which they set on fire to amuse and delight the company i do not know that the peacock is much used at our entertainments at present except now and then at an aldermans dinner or a common council feast when our citizens resolve to be splendid and even then it is never served with its cotton and camphire  like other birds of the poultry kind the peacock feeds upon corn but its chief predilection is for barley but as it is a very proud and fickle bird there is scarce any food that it will not at times covet and pursue insects and tender plants are often eagerly sought at a time that it has a sufficiency of its natural food provided more nearly in the indulgence of these capricious pursuits walls cannot easily confine it it strips the tops of houses of their tiles or thatch it lays waste the labors of the gardener roots up his choicest seeds and nips his favorite flowers in the bud thus its beauty but ill recompenses for the mischief it occasions and many of the more homely looking fowls are very deservedly preferred before it  nor is the peacock less a debauchee in its affections than a glutton in its appetites he is still more salacious than even the cock and though not possessed of the same vigor yet burns with more immoderate desire he requires five females at least to attend him and if there be not a sufficient number he will even run upon and tread the sitting hen for this reason the peahen endeavors as much as she can to hide her nest from the male as he would otherwise disturb her sitting and break her eggs  the peahen seldom lays above five or six eggs in this climate before she sits aristotle describes her as laying twelve and it is probable in her native climate she may be thus prolific for it is certain that in the forests where they breed naturally they are numerous beyond expression this bird lives about twenty years and not till its third year has it that beautiful variegated plumage that adorns its tail  in the kingdom of cambaya says tavener near the city of baroch whole flocks of them are seen in the fields they are very shy however and it is impossible to come near them they run off swifter than the partridge and hide themselves in thickets where it is impossible to find them they perch by night upon trees and the fowler often approaches them at that season with a kind of banner on which a peacock is painted to the life on either side a lighted torch is fixed on the top of this decoy and the peacock when disturbed flies to what it takes for another and is thus caught in a nooze prepared for that purpose  there are varieties of this bird some of which are white others crested that which is called the peacock of thibet is the most beautiful of the feathered creation containing in its plumage all the most vivid colors red blue yellow and green disposed in an almost artificial order as if merely to please the eye of the beholder  chap iv the turkey the natal place of the cock and the peacock is pretty well ascertained but there are stronger doubts concerning the turkey some contending that it has been brought into europe from the east indies many centuries ago while others assert that it is wholly unknown in that part of the world that it is a native of the new continent and that it was not brought into europe till the discovery of that part of the world  those who contend for the latter opinion very truly observe that among all the descriptions we have of eastern birds that of the turkey is not to be found while on the contrary it is very well known in the new continent where it runs wild about the woods it is said by them to be first seen in france in the reign of francis the first and in england in that of henry the eighth which is about the time when mexico was first conquered by spain on the other hand it is asserted that the turkey so far from being unknown in europe before that time was known even to the ancients and that aelian has given a pretty just description of it they allege that its very name implies its having been brought from some part of the east and that it is found among other dainties served up to the tables of the great before that time among ourselves but what they pretend to be the strongest proof is that though the wild turkey be so very common in america yet the natives cannot contrive to tame it and though hatched in the ordinary manner nothing can render it domestic in this diversity of opinions perhaps it is best to suspend assent till more lights are thrown on the subject however i am inclined to concur with the former opinion  with us when young it is one of the tenderest of all birds yet in its wild state it is found in great plenty in the forests of canada that are covered with snow above three parts of the year in their natural woods they are found much larger than in their state of domestic captivity they are much more beautiful also their feathers being of a dark gray bordered at the edges with a bright gold color these the savages of the country weave into cloaks to adorn their persons and fashion into fans and umbrellas but never once think of taking into keeping animals that the woods furnish them with in sufficient abundance savage man seems to find a delight in precarious possession a great part of the pleasure of the chase lies in the uncertainty of the pursuit and he is unwilling to abridge himself in any accidental success that may attend his fatigues the hunting the turkey therefore makes one of his principal diversions as its flesh contributes chiefly to the support of his family when he has discovered the place of their retreat which in general is near fields of nettles or where there is plenty of any kind of grain he takes his dog with him which is trained to the sport a faithful rough creature supposed to be originally reclaimed from the wolf and he sends him into the midst of the flock the turkies no sooner perceive their enemy than they set off running at full speed and with such swiftness that they leave the dog far behind them he follows nevertheless and sensible they must soon be tired as they cannot go full speed for any length of time he at last forces them to take shelter in a tree where they sit quite spent and fatigued till the hunter comes up and with a long pole knocks them down one after the other  this manner of suffering themselves to be destroyed argues no great instinct in the animal and indeed in their captive state they do not appear to be possessed of much they seem a stupid vain querulous tribe apt enough to quarrel among themselves yet without any weapons to do each other an injury every body knows the strange antipathy the turkeycock has to a red color how he bristles and with his peculiar gobbling sound flies to attack it but there is another method of increasing the animosity of these birds against each other which is often practiced by boys when they have a mind for a battle this is no more than to smear over the head of one of the turkies with dirt and the rest run to attack it with all the speed of impotent animosity nay two of them thus disguised will fight each other till they are almost suffocated with fatigue and anger  but though so furious among themselves they are weak and cowardly against other animals though far less powerful than they the cock often makes the turkey keep at a distance and they seldom venture to attack him but with united force when they rather oppress him by their weight than annoy him by their arms there is no animal how contemptible soever that will venture boldly to face the turkeycock that he will not fly from on the contrary with the insolence of a bully he pursues any thing that seems to fear him particularly lapdogs and children against both which he seems to have a peculiar aversion on such occasions after he has made them scamper he returns to his female train displays his plumage around struts about the yard and gobbles out a note of selfapprobation  the female seems of a milder gentler disposition rather querulous than bold she hunts about in quest of grain and pursuit of insects being particularly delighted with the eggs of ants and caterpillars she lays eighteen or twenty eggs larger than those of a hen whitish but marked with spots resembling the freckles of the face her young are extremely tender at first and must be carefully fed with curd chopped with dock leaves but as they grow older they become more hardy and follow the mother to considerable distances in pursuit of insect food which they prefer to any other on these occasions however the female though so large and as it would seem so powerful a bird gives them but very little protection against the attacks of any rapacious animal that comes in her way she rather warns her young to shift for themselves than prepares to defend them i have heard says the abbe la pluche a turkey hen when at the head of her brood send forth the most hideous scream without knowing as yet the cause however her young immediately when the warning was given skulked under the bushes the grass or whatever else offered for shelter or protection they even stretched themselves at their full length upon the ground and continued lying as motionless as if they were dead in the mean time the mother with her eyes directed upwards continued her cries and screaming as before upon looking up to where she seemed to gaze i discovered a black spot just under the clouds but was unable at first to determine what it was however it soon appeared to be a bird of prey though at first at too great a distance to be distinguished i have seen one of these animals continue in this violent agitated state and her whole brood pinned down as it were to the ground for four hours together whilst their formidable so has taken his circuits has mounted and hovered directly over their heads at last upon disappearing the parent began to change her note and sent forth another cry which in an instant gave life to the whole trembling tribe and they all flocked round her with expressions of pleasure as if conscious of their happy escape from danger  when once grown up turkies are very hardy birds and feed themselves at very little expense to the farmer those of norfolk are said to be the largest of this kingdom weighing from twenty to thirty pounds there are places however in the east indies where they are known only in their domestic state in which they grow to the weight of sixty pounds  chap v the pheasant it would surprise a sportsman to be told that the pheasant which he finds wild in the woods in the remotest parts of the kingdom and in forests which can scarce be said to have an owner is a foreign bird and was at first artificially propagated amongst us they were brought into europe from the banks of the phasis a river of colchis in asia minor and from whence they still retain their name  next to the peacock they are the most beautiful of birds as well for the vivid color of their plumes as for their happy mixtures and variety it is far beyond the power of the pencil to draw any thing so glossy so bright or points so finely blending into each other we are told that when craesus king of lydia was seated on his throne adorned with royal magnificence and all the barbarous pomp of eastern splendor he asked solon if he had ever beheld any thing so fine the greek philosopher no way moved by the objects before him or taking a pride in his native simplicity replied that after having seen the beautiful plumage of the pheasant he could be astonished at no other finery  in fact nothing can satisfy the eye with a greater variety and richness of ornament than this beautiful creature the iris of the eyes is yellow and the eyes themselves are surrounded with a scarlet color sprinkled with small specks of black on the forepart of the head there are blackish feathers mixed with a shining purple the top of the head and the upper part of the neck are tinged with a darkish green that shines like silk in some the top of the head is of a shining blue and the head itself as well as the upper part of the neck appears sometimes blue and sometimes green as it is differently placed to the eye of the spectator the feathers of the breast the shoulders the middle of the back and the sides under the wings have a blackish ground with edges tinged of an exquisite color which appears sometimes black and sometimes purple according to the different lights it is placed in under the purple there is a transverse streak of gold color the tail from the middle feathers to the root is about eighteen inches long the legs the feet and the toes are of the color of horn there are black spurs on the legs shorter than those of a cock there is a membrane that connects two of the toes together and the male is much more beautiful than the female  this bird though so beautiful to the eye is not less delicate when served up to the table its flesh is considered as the greatest dainty and when the old physicians spoke of the wholesomeness of any viands they made their comparison with the flesh of the pheasant however notwithstanding all these perfections to tempt the curiosity or the palate the pheasant has multiplied in its wild state and as if disdaining the protection of man has left him to take shelter in the thickest woods and the remotest forests all others of the domestic kind the cock the turkey or the pintada when once reclaimed have still continued in their domestic state and persevered in the habits and appetites of willing slavery but the pheasant though taken from its native warm retreats where the woods supply variety of food and the warm sun suits its tender constitution has still continued its attachment to native freedom and now wild among us makes the most envied ornament of our parks and forests where he feeds upon acorns and berries and the scanty produce of our chilling climate  this spirit of independance seems to attend the pheasant even in captivity in the woods the hen pheasant lays from eighteen to twenty eggs in a season but in a domestic state she seldom lays above ten in the same manner when wild she hatches and leads up her brood with patience vigilance and courage but when kept tame she never sits well so that a hen is generally her substitute upon such occasions and as for leading her young to their food she is utterly ignorant of where it is to be found and the young birds starve if left solely to her protection the pheasant therefore on every account seems better left at large in the woods than reclaimed to pristine captivity its fecundity when wild is sufficient to stock the forest its beautiful plumage adorns it and its flesh retains a higher flavor from its unlimited freedom  however it has been the aim of late to take these birds once more from the woods and to keep them in places fitted for their reception like all others of the poultry kind they have no great sagacity and suffer themselves easily to be taken at night they roost upon the highest trees of the wood and by day they come down into the lower brakes and bushes where their food is chiefly found they generally make a kind of flapping noise when they are with the females and this often apprizes the sportsman of their retreats at other times he tracks them in the snow and frequently takes them in springs but of all birds they are shot most easily as they always make a whirring noise when they rise by which they alarm the gunner and being a large mark and flying very slow there is scarce any missing them  ah what avail his glossy varying dies his purpled crest and scarletcircled eyes the vivid green his shining plumes unfold his painted wings and breast that flames with gold pope when these birds are taken young into keeping they become as familiar as chickens and when they are designed for breeding they are put together in a yard five hens to a cock for this bird like all of the poultry kind is very salacious in her natural state the female makes her nest of dry grass and leaves the same must be laid for her in the pheasandry and she herself will sometimes properly dispose them if she refuses to hatch her eggs then a common hen must be got to supply her place which task she will perform with perseverance and success the young ones are very difficult to be reared and they must be supplied with antseggs which is the food the old one leads them to gather when wild in the woods to make these go the farther they are to be chopped up with curds or other meat and the young ones are to be fed with great exactness both as to the quantity and the time of their supply this food is sometimes also to be varied and woodlice ear wigs and other insects are to make a variety the place where they are reared must be kept extremely clean their water must be changed twice or thrice a day they must not be exposed till the dew is off the ground in the morning and they should always be taken in before sunset when they become adult they very well can shift for themselves but they are particularly fond of oats and barley  in order to increase the breed and make it still more valuable longolius teaches us a method that appears very peculiar the pheasant is a very bold bird when first brought into the yard among other poultry not sparing the peacock nor even such young cocks and hens as it can master but after a time it will live tamely among them and will at last be brought to couple with a common hen the breed thus produced take much stronger after the pheasant than the hen and in a few successions if they be let to breed with the cockpheasant for the mixture is not barren there will be produced a species more tame stronger and more prolific so that he adds that it is strange why most of our pheasandries are not stocked with birds produced in this manner  the pheasant when full grown seems to feed indifferently upon every thing that offers it is said by a french writer that one of the kings sportsmen shooting at a parcel of crows that were gathered round a dead carcass to his great surprise upon coming up found that he had killed as many pheasants as crows it is even asserted by some that such is the carnivorous disposition of this bird that when several of them are put together in the same yard if one of them happens to fall sick or seems to be pining that all the rest will fall upon kill and devour it such is the language of books those who have frequent opportunities of examining the manners of the bird itself know what credit ought to be given to such an account  of the pheasant as of all other domestic fowl there are many varieties there are white pheasants crested pheasants spotted pheasants but of all others the golden pheasant of china is the most beautiful it is a doubt whether the peacock itself can bear the comparison however the natives of china would not have us consider it as their most beautiful bird though all covered over with eyes resembling in miniature those of a peacock by their accounts it is far exceeded by the fongwhang an imaginary bird of which they give a most phantastic description it is thus that the people of every country though possessed of the greatest advantages have still others that they would persuade strangers they enjoy which have existence only in the imagination  chap vi the pintada or guineahen this is a very remarkable bird and in some measure unites the characteristics of the pheasant and the turkey it has the fine delicate shape of the one and the bare head of the other to be more particular it is about the size of a common hen but as it is supported on longer legs it looks much larger it has a round back with a tail turned downwards like a partridge the head is covered with a kind of casque and the whole plumage is black or dark gray speckled with white spots it has wattles under the bill which do not proceed from the lower chap as in cocks but from the upper which gives it a very peculiar air while its restless gait and odd chuckling sound distinguish it sufficiently from all other birds whatever  it is well known all over europe and even better than with us as the nations that border on the mediterranean probably had it before us from those parts of africa which lay nearest accordingly we find it in different countries called by different names from the place whence they had it they are by some called the barbaryhen by others the tamis bird and by others the bird of numidia we have given it the name of that part of africa from whence probably it was first brought  in many parts of their native country they are seen in vast flocks together feeding their young and leading them in quest of food all their habits are like those of the poultrykind and they agree in every other respect except that the male and female are so much alike that they can hardly be distinguished asunder the only difference lies in the wattles described above which in the cock are of a blueish cast in the hen they are more inclining to a red their eggs like their bodies are speckled in our climate they lay but five or six in a season but they are far more prolific in their sultry regions at home they are kept among us rather for show than use as their flesh is not much esteemed and as they give a good deal of trouble in the rearing  chap vii the bustard the bustard is the largest landbird that is a native of britain it was once much more numerous than it is at present but the increased cultivation of the country and the extreme delicacy of its flesh has greatly thinned the species so that a time may come when it may be doubted whether ever so large a bird was bred among us it is probable that long before this the bustard would have been extirpated but for its peculiar manner of feeding had it continued to seek shelter among our woods in proportion as they were cut down it must have been destroyed if in the forest the fowler might approach it without being seen and the bird from its size would be too great a mark to be easily missed but it inhabits only the open and extensive plain where its food lies in abundance and where every invader may be seen at a distance  the bustard is much larger than the turkey the male generally weighing from twentyfive to twenty seven pounds the neck is a foot long and the legs a foot and a half the wings are not proportionable to the rest of the body being but four feet from the tip of one to the other for which reason the bird flies with great difficulty the head and neck of the male are ashcolored the back is barred transversely with black bright and rust color the greater quill feathers are black the belly white and the tail which consists of twenty feathers is marked with broad black bars  it would seem odd as was hinted before how so large a landbird as this could find shelter in so cultivated a country as england but the wonder will cease when we find it only in the most open countries where there is scarce any approaching without being discovered they are frequently seen in flocks of fifty or more in the extensive downs of salisbury plain in the heaths of suffex and cambridgeshire the dorsetshire uplands and so on as far as east lothian in scotland in those extensive plains where there are no woods to screen the sportsman nor hedges to creep along the bustards enjoy an indolent security their food is composed of the berries that grow among the heath and the large earthworms that appear in great quantities on the downs before sunrising in summer it is in vain that the fowler creeps forward to approach them they have always sentinels placed at proper eminences which are ever on the watch and warn the flock of the smallest appearance of danger all therefore that is left the sportsman is the comfortless view of their distant security he may wish but they are in safety  it sometimes happens that these birds though they are seldom shot by the gun are often run down by greyhounds as they are voracious and greedy they often sacrifice their safety to their appetite and feed themselves so very fat that they are unable to fly without great preparation when the greyhound therefore comes within a certain distance the bustard runs off flapping its wings and endeavoring to gather air enough under them to rise in the mean time the enemy approaches nearer and nearer till it is too late for the bird even to think of obtaining safety by flight for just at the rise there is always time lost and of this the bird is sensible it continues therefore on the foot until it has got a sufficient way before the dog for flight or until it is taken  as there are few places where they can at once find proper food and security so they generally continue near their old haunts seldom wandering above twenty or thirty miles from home as their food is replete with moisture it enables them to live upon these dry plains where there are scarcely any springs of water a long time without drinking besides this nature has given the males an admirable magazine for their security against thirst this is a pouch the entrance of which lies immediately under the tongue and capable of holding near seven quarts of water this is probably filled upon proper occasions to supply the hen when sitting or the young before they can fly  like all other birds of the poultrykind they change their mates at the season of incubation which is about the latter end of summer they separate in pairs if there be a sufficiency of females for the males but when this happens to be otherwise the males fight until one of them falls in france they often find some of those victims to gallantry dead in the fields and no doubt are not displeased at the occasion  they make their nests upon the ground only just scraping a hole in the earth and sometimes lining it with a little long grass or straw there they lay two eggs only almost of the size of a goose egg of a pale olive brown marked with spots of a darker color they hatch for about five weeks and the young ones run about as soon as they are out of the shell  the bustards assemble in flocks in the month of october and keep together till april in winter as their food becomes more scarce they support themselves indiscriminately by feeding on moles mice and even little birds when they can seize them for want of other food they are contented to live upon turnep leaves and such like succulent vegetables in some parts of switzerland they are found frozen in the fields in severe weather but when taken to a warm place they again recover they usually live fifteen years and are incapable of being propagated in a domestic state as they probably want that food which best agrees with their appetite  chap viii the grous and its affinities the cock of the wood the black cock the grous and the ptarmigan  these are all birds of a similar nature and chiefly found in heathy mountains and piny forests at a distance from mankind they might once indeed have been common enough all over england when a great part of the country was covered with heath but at present their numbers are thinned the two first of this kind are utterly unknown in the south and have taken refuge in the northern parts of scotland where the extensive heaths afford them security and the forests shelter  the cock of the wood is sometimes of the size of a turkey and often weighs near fourteen pounds the black cock of which the male is all over black though the female is of the color of a partridge is about the size of a hen and like the former is only found with us in the highlands of scotland the grous is about half as large again as a partridge and its color much like that of a woodcock but redder the ptarmigan is still somewhat less and is of a pale brown or ash color they are all distinguishable from other birds of the poultry kind by a naked skin of a scarlet color above the eyes in the place and of the figure of eyebrows  it seems to be something extraordinary that all the larger wild animals of every species choose the darkest and the inmost recesses of the woods for their residence while the smaller kinds come more into the open and cultivated parts where there is more food and more danger it is thus with the birds i am describing while the cock of the wood is seldom seen except on the inaccessible parts of heathy mountains or in the midst of piny forests the grous is found in great numbers in the neighborhood of cornfields where there is heath to afford retreat and shelter their food too somewhat differs while the smaller kind lives upon heath blossoms cranberries and corn the larger feeds upon the cones of the pine tree and will sometimes entirely strip one tree before it offers to touch those of another though just beside him in other respects the manners of these birds are the same being both equally simple in their diet and licentious in their amors  the cock of the wood for it is from him we will take our description is as was said chiefly fond of a mountainous and wooded situation in winter he resides in the darkest and inmost part of the woods in summer he ventures down from his retreats to make short depredations on the farmers corn the delicacy of his flesh in some measure sets a high price upon his head and as he is greatly sought after so he continues when he comes down from the hills always on his guard upon these occasions he is seldom surprised and those who would take him must venture up to find him in his native retreats  the cock of the wood when in the forest attaches himself principally to the oak and the pine tree the cones of the latter serving for his food and the thick boughs for an habitation he even makes a choice of what cones he shall feed upon for he sometimes will strip one tree bare before he will deign to touch the cones of another he feeds also upon ants eggs which seem a high delicacy to all birds of the poultry kind cranberries are likewise often found in his crop and his gizzard like that of domestic fowls contains a quantity of gravel for the purposes of assisting his powers of digestion  at the earliest return of spring this bird begins to feel the genial influence of the season during the month of march the approaches of courtship are continued and do not desist till the trees have all their leaves and the forest is in full bloom during this whole season the cock of the wood is seen at sunrise and setting extremely active upon one of the largest branches of the pine tree with his tail raised and expanded like a fan and the wings drooping he is seen walking backward and forward his neck stretched out his head swolen and red and making a thousand ridiculous postures his cry upon that occasion is a kind of loud explosion which is instantly followed by a noise like the whetting of a scythe which ceases and commences alternatively for about an hour and is then terminated by the same explosion  during the time this singular cry continues the bird seems entirely deaf and insensible of every danger whatever noise may be made near him or even though fired at he still continues his call and this is the time that sportsmen generally take to shoot him upon all other occasions he is the most timorous and watchful bird in nature but now he seems entirely absorbed by his instincts and seldom leaves the place where he first begins to feel the accesses of desire this extraordinary cry which is accompanied by a clapping of the wings is no sooner finished than the female hearing it replies approaches and places herself under the tree from whence the cock descends to impregnate her the number of females that on this occasion resort to his call is uncertain but one male generally suffices for all  the female is much less than her mate and entirely unlike him in plumage so that she might be mistaken for a bird of another species she seldom lays more than six or seven eggs which are white and marked with yellow of the size of a common hens egg she generally lays them in a dry place and a mossy ground and hatches them without the company of the cock when she is obliged during the time of incubation to leave her eggs in quest of food she covers them up so artfully with moss or dry leaves that it is extremely difficult to discover them on this occasion she is extremely tame and tranquil however wild and timorous in ordinary she often keeps to her nest though strangers attempt to drag her away  as soon as the young ones are hatched they are seen running with extreme agility after the mother though sometimes they are not entirely disengaged from the shell the hen leads them forward for the first time into the woods shows them ants eggs and the wild mountainberries which while young are their only food as they grow older their appetites grow stronger and they then feed upon the tops of hither and the cones of the pine tree in this manner they soon come to perfection they are an hardy bird their food lies every where before them and it would seem that they should increase in great abundance but this is not the case their numbers are thinned by rapacious birds and beasts of every kind and still more by their own salacious contests  as soon as the clutching is over which the female performs in the manner of an hen the whole brood follows the mother for about a month or two at the end of which the young males entirely forsake her and keep in great harmony together till the beginning of spring at this season they begin for the first time to feel the genial access and then adieu to all their former friendships they begin to consider each other as rivals and the rage of concupiscence quite extinguishes the spirit of society they fight each other like game cocks and at that time are so inattentive to their own safety that it often happens that two or three of them are killed at a shot it is probable that in these contests the bird which comes off victorious takes possession of the female seraglio as it is certain they have no faithful attachments this account of the cock of the wood is taken from the journal oeconomique and may be relied on   chap ix of the partridge and its varieties the partridge may be particularly considered as belonging to the sportsman it is a bird which even our laws have taken under protection and like a peacock or a hen may be ranked as a private property the only difference now is that we feed one in our farms the other in our yards that these are contented captives those servants that have it in their power to change their master by changing their habitation  these birds says willoughby hold the principal place in the feasts and entertainments of princes without which their feasts are esteemed ignoble vulgar and of no account the frenchmen do so highly value and are so fond of the partridge that if they be wanting they utterly slight and despise the best spread tables as if there could be no feast without them but however this might be in the times of our historian the partridge is now too common in france to be considered as a delicacy and this as well as every other simple dish is exploded for luxuries of a more compound invention  in england where the partridge is much scarcer and a great deal dearer it is still a favorite delicacy at the tables of the rich and the desire of keeping it to themselves has induced them to make laws for its preservation no way harmonizing with the general spirit of english legislation what can be more arbitrary than to talk of preserving the game which when defined means no more than that the poor shall abstain from what the rich have taken a fancy to keep for themselves if these birds could like a cock or a hen be made legal property could they be taught to keep within certain districts and only feed on those grounds that belong to the man whose entertainments they improve it then might with some show of justice be admitted that as a man fed them so he might claim them but this is not the case nor is it in any mans power to lay a restraint upon the liberty of these birds that when let loose put no limits to their excursions they feed every where upon every mans ground and no man can say these birds are fed only by me those birds which are nourished by all belong to all nor can any one man or any set of men lay claim to them when still continuing in a state of nature  i never walked out about the environs of paris that i did not consider the immense quantity of game that was running almost tame on every side of me as a badge of the slavery of the people and what they wished me to observe as an object of triumph i always regarded with a kind of secret compassion yet this people have no gamelaws for the remoter parts of the kingdom the game is only preserved in a few places for the king and is free in most places else in england the prohibition is general and the peasant has not a right to what even slaves as he is taught to call them are found to possess  of partridges there are two kinds the gray and the red the red partridge is the largest of the two and often perches upon trees the gray with which we are best acquainted in england is most prolific and always keeps on the ground  the partridge seems to be a bird well known all over the world as it is found in every country and in every climate as well in the frozen regions about the pole as the torrid tracts under the equator it even seems to adapt itself to the nature of the climate where it resides in greenland the partridge which is brown in summer as soon as the icy winter sets in begins to take a covering suited to the season it is then clothed with a warm down beneath and its outward plumage assumes the color of the snows amongst which it seeks its food thus it is doubly fitted for the place by the warmth and the color of its plumage the one to defend it from the cold the other to prevent its being noticed by the enemy those of barakonda on the other hand are longer legged much swifter of foot and choose the highest rocks and precipices to reside in  they all however agree in one character of being immoderately addicted to venery and as some writers affirm often to an unnatural degree it is certain the male will pursue the hen even to her nest and will break her eggs rather than not indulge his inclinations though the young ones have kept together in flocks during the winter when they begin to pair in spring their society disperses and combats very terrible with respect to each other ensue their manners in other circumstances resemble all those of poultry in general but their cunning and instincts seem superior to those of the larger kinds perhaps as they live in the very neighborhood of their enemies they have more frequent occasion to put their little arts in practice and learn by habit the means of evasion or safety whenever therefore a dog or other formidable animal approaches their nest the female uses every means to draw him away she keeps just before him pretends to be incapable of flying just hops up and then falls down before him but never goes off so far as to discourage her pursuer at length when she has drawn him entirely away from her secret treasure she at once takes wing and fairly leaves him to gaze after her in despair  after the danger is over and the dog withdrawn she then calls her young who assemble at once at her cry and follow where she leads them there are generally from ten to fifteen in a covey and if unmolested they live from fifteen to seventeen years  there are several methods of taking them as is well known that by which they are taken in a net with a setting dog is the most pleasant as well as the most secure the dog as every body knows is trained to this exercise by a long course of education by blows and caresses he is taught to lie down at the word of command a partridge is shown him and he is then ordered to lie down he is brought into the field and when the sportsman perceives where the covey lies he orders his dog to crouch at length the dog from habit crouches wherever he approaches a covey and this is the signal which the sportsman receives for unfolding and covering the birds with his net a covey thus caught is sometimes fed in a place proper for their reception but they can never be thoroughly tamed like the rest of our domestic poultry  chap x the quail the last of the poultry kind that i shall mention is the quail a bird much smaller than any of the former being not above half the size of a partridge the feathers of the head are black edged with rusty brown the breast is of a pale yellowish red spotted with black the feathers on the back are marked with lines of pale yellow and the legs are of a pale hue except in the colors thus described and the size it every way resembles a partridge in shape and except that it is a bird of passage all others of the poultry kind in its habits and nature  the quail is by all known to be a bird of passage and yet if we consider its heavy manner of flying and its dearth of plumage with respect to its corpulence we shall be surprised how a bird so apparently ill qualified for migration should take such extensive journeys nothing however is more certain when we sailed from rhodes to alexandria says bellonius about autumn many quails flying from the north to the south were taken in our ship and sailing at springtime the contrary way from the south to the north i observed them on their return when many of them were taken in the same manner this account is confirmed by many others who aver that they choose a north wind for these adventures the south wind being very unfavourable as it retards their flight by moistening their plumage they then fly two by two continuing when their way lies over land to go faster by night than by day and to fly very high to avoid being surprised or set upon by birds of prey however it still remains a doubt whether quails take such long journies as bellonius has made them perform it is now asserted by some that the quail only migrates from one province of a country to another for instance in england they fly from the inland counties to those bordering on the sea and continue there all the winter if frost or snow drive them out of the stubble fields or marshes they then retreat to the sea side shelter themselves among the weeds and live upon what is thrown up from the sea upon shore particularly in essex the time of their appearance upon the coasts of that country exactly coincides with their disappearance from the more internal parts of the kingdom so that what has been said of their long flights is probably not so well founded as is generally supposed  these birds are much less prolific than the partridge seldom laying more than six or seven whitish eggs marked with ragged rust colored spots but their ardour in courtship yields scarce to any other bird as they are fierce and cruel at that season to each other fighting most desperately and a punishment they richly deserve being at that time very easily taken quailfighting was a favorite amusement among the athenians they abstained from the flesh of this bird deeming it unwholesome as supposing that it fed upon the white hellebore but they reared great numbers of them for the pleasure of seeing them fight and staked sums of money as we do with regard to cocks upon the success of the combat fashion however has at present changed with regard to this bird we take no pleasure in its courage but its flesh is considered as a very great delicacy  quails are easily caught by a call the fowler early in the morning having spread his net hides himself under it among the corn he then imitates the voice of the female with his quailpipe which the cock hearing approaches with the utmost assiduity when he has got under the net the fowler then discovers himself and terrifies the quail who attempting to get away entangles himself the more in the net and is taken the quail may thus very well serve to illustrate the old adage that every passion carried to an inordinate excess will at last lead to ruin  part iii of birds of the pie kind chap i birds of the pie kind in marshalling our army of the feathered creation we have placed in the van a race of birds long bred to war and whose passion is slaughter in the center we have placed the slow and heavy laden that are usually brought into the field to be destroyed we now come to a kind of light infantry that partake something of the spirit of the two former and yet belonging to neither in this class we must be content to marshal a numerous irregular tribe variously armed with different pursuits appetites and manners not formidably formed for war and yet generally delighting in mischief not slowly and usefully obedient and yet without any professed enmity to the rest of their fellow tenants of air  to speak without metaphor under this class of birds we may arrange all that noisy restless chattering teizing tribe that lies between the hen and the thrush that from the size of the raven down to that of the woodpecker flutter round our habitations and rather with the spirit of pilferers than of robbers make free with the fruits of human industry  of all the other classes this seems to be that which the least contributes to furnish out the pleasures or supply the necessities of man the falcon hunts for him the poultry tribe supplies him with luxurious food and the little sparrow race delight him with the melody of their warblings the crane kind make a studied variety in his entertainments and the class of ducks are not only many of them delicate in their flesh but extremely useful for their feathers but in the class of the pie kind there are few except the pidgeon that are any way useful they serve rather to teize man than to assist or amuse him like faithless servants they are fond of his neighborhood because they mostly live by his labor but their chief study is what they can plunder in his absence while their deaths make him no atonement for their depredation  but though with respect to man this whole class is rather noxious than beneficial though he may consider them in this light as false noisy troublesome neighbors yet with respect to each other no class of birds are so ingenious so active or so well fitted for society could we suppose a kind of morality among birds we should find that these are by far the most industrious the most faithful the most constant and the most connubial the rapacious kinds drive out their young before they are fit to struggle with adversity but the pie kind cherish their young to the last the poultry class are faithless and promiscuous in their courtship but these live in pairs and their attachments are wholly confined to each other the sparrow kind frequently overleap the bounds of nature and make illicit varieties but these never they live in harmony with each other every species is true to its kind and transmits an unpolluted race to posterity  as other kinds build in rocks or upon the ground the chief place where these build is in trees or bushes the male takes his share in the labors of building the nest and often relieves his mate in the duties of incubation both take this office by turns and when the young are excluded both are equally active in making them an ample provision  they sometimes live in societies and in these there are general laws observed and a kind of republican form of government established among them they watch not only for the general safety but for that of every other bird of the grove how often have we seen a fowler stealing in upon a flock of ducks or wild geese disturbed by the alarming note of a crow or a magpie its single voice gave the whole thoughtless tribe warning and taught them in good time to look to their safety  nor are these birds less remarkable for their instincts than their capacity for instruction there is an apparent cunning or archness in the look of the whole tribe and i have seen crows and ravens taught to fetch and carry with the docility of a spaniel indeed it is often an exercise that without teaching all this tribe are but too fond of every body knows what a passion they have for shining substances and such toys as some of us put a value upon a whole family has been alarmed at the loss of a ring every servant has been accused and every creature in the house conscious of their own innocence suspected each other when to the utter surprise of all it has been found in the nest of a tame magpie or a jackdaw that nobody had ever thought of  however as this class is very numerous it is not to be supposed that the manners are alike in all some such as the pidgeon are gentle and serviceable to man others are noxious capricious and noisy in a few general characters they all agree namely in having hoarse voices slight active bodies and a facility of flight that baffles even the boldest of the rapacious kinds in the pursuit i will begin with those birds which most properly may be said to belong to this class and go on till i finish with the pidgeon an harmless bird that resembles this tribe in little else except their size and that seems to be the shade uniting the pie and the sparrow kind into one general picture  it is not to be expected that in this sketch of the great magazine of nature we can stop singly to contemplate every object to describe the number that offers would be tedious and the similitude that one bears another would make the history disgusting as an historian in relating the actions of some noble people does not stop to give the character of every private man in the army but only of such as have been distinguished by their conduct courage or treachery so should the historian of nature only seize upon the most striking objects before him and having given one common account of the most remarkable refer the peculiarities of the rest to their general description  chap ii of the raven the crow and their affinities the raven the carrioncrow and the rook are birds so well known that a long description would but obscure our ideas of them the raven is the largest of the three and distinguished from the rest not only by his size but by his bill being somewhat more hooked than that of the rest as for the carrioncrow and the rook they so strongly resemble each other both in make and size that they are not easily distinguished asunder the chief difference to be found between them lies in the bill of the rook which by frequently being thrust into the ground to fetch out grubs and earthworms is bare of feathers as far as the eyes and appears of a whitish color it differs also in the purple splendor or gloss of its feathers which in the carrioncrow are of a more dirty black nor is it amiss to make these distinctions as the rook has but too frequently suffered for its simitude to the carrioncrow and thus an harmless bird that feeds only upon insects and corn has been destroyed for another that feeds upon carrion and is often destructive among young poultry  the manners of the raven and the carrioncrow are exactly similar they both feed upon carrion they fly only in pairs and will destroy other birds if they can take them by surprise but it is very different with the rook the daw and the cornish chough which may be all ranked in this order they are sociable and harmless they live only upon insects and grain and wherever they are instead of injuring other birds they seem sentinels for the whole feathered creation it will be proper therefore to describe these two sorts according to their respective appetites as they have nothing in common but the very strong similitude they bear to each other in their color and formation  the raven is a bird found in every region of the world strong and hardy he is uninfluenced by the changes of the weather and when other birds seem numbed with cold or pining with famine the raven is active and healthy busily employed in prowling for prey or sporting in the coldest atmosphere as the heats at the line do not oppress him so he bears the cold of the polar countries with equal indifference he is sometimes indeed seen milk white and this may probably be the effect of the rigorous climates of the north it is most likely that this change is wrought upon him as upon most other animals in that part of the world where their robes particularly in winter assume the color of the country they inhabit as in old age when the natural heat decays the hair grows gray and at last white so among these animals the cold of the climate may produce a similar languishment of color and may shut up those pores that conveyed the tincturing fluids to the extremest parts of the body  however this may be white ravens are often shown among us which i have heard some say are rendered thus by art and this we could readily suppose if they were as easily changed in their color as they are altered in their habits and dispositions a raven may be reclaimed to almost every purpose to which birds can be converted he may be trained up for fowling like an hawk he may be taught to fetch and carry like a spaniel he may be taught to speak like a parrot but the most extraordinary of all is that he can be taught to sing like a man i have heard a raven sing the black joke with great distinctness truth and humor  indeed when the raven is taken as a domestic he has many qualities that render him extremely amusing busy inquisitive and impudent he goes every where affronts and drives off the dogs plays his pranks on the poultry and is particularly assiduous in cultivating the good will of the cookmaid who seems to be the favorite of the family but then with the amusing qualities of a favorite he often also has the vices and defects he is a glutton by nature and a thief by habit he does not confine himself to petty depredations on the pantry or the larder he soars at more magnificent plunder at spoils that he can neither exhibit nor enjoy but which like a miser he rests satisfied with having the satisfaction of sometimes visiting and contemplating in secret a piece of money a teaspoon or a ring are always tempting baits to his avarice these he will slily seize upon and if not watched will carry to his favorite hole  in his wild state the raven is an active and greedy plunderer nothing comes amiss to him whether his prey be living or long dead it is all the same he falls to with a voracious appetite and when he has gorged himself flies to acquaint his fellows that they may participate of the spoil if the carcass be already in the possession of some more powerful animal a wolf a fox or a dog the raven sits at a little distance content to continue an humble spectator till they have done if in his flights he perceives no hopes of carrion and his scent is so exquisite that he can smell it at a vast distance he then contents himself with more unsavory food fruits insects and the accidental desert of a dunghill  this bird chiefly builds its nest in trees and lays five or six eggs of a pale green color marked with small brownish spots they live sometimes in pairs and sometimes they frequent in great numbers the neighborhood of populous cities where they are useful in devouring those carcases that would otherwise putrefy and infect the air they build in high trees or old towers in the beginning of march with us in england and sometimes sooner as the spring is more or less advanced for the season but it is not always near towns that they fix their retreats they often build in unfrequented places and drive all other birds from their vicinity they will not permit even their young to keep in the same district but drive them off when they are sufficiently able to shift for themselves martin in his description of the western isles avers that there are three little islands among the number which are occupied by a pair of ravens each that drive off all other birds with great cries and impetuosity  notwithstanding the injury these birds do in picking out the eyes of sheep and lambs when they find them sick and helpless a vulgar respect is paid them as being the birds that fed the prophet elijah in the wilderness this prepossession in favor of the raven is of very ancient date as the romans themselves who thought the bird ominous paid it from motives of fear the most profound veneration one of these that had been kept in the temple of castor as pliny informs us flew down into the shop of a tailor who took much delight in the visits of his new acquaintance he taught the bird several tricks but particularly to pronounce the names of the emperor tiberius and the whole royal family the tailor was beginning to grow rich by those who came to see this wonderful raven till an envious neighbor displeased at the taylors success killed the bird and deprived the tailor of his future hopes of fortune the romans however took the poor taylors part they punished the man who offered the injury and gave the raven all the honors of a magnificent interment  birds in general live longer than quadrupedes and the raven is said to be one of the most longlived of the number hesiod asserts that a raven will live nine times as long as a man but though this is fabulous it is certain that some of them have been known to live near an hundred years this animal seems possessed of those qualities that generally produce longevity a good appetite and great exercise in clear weather the ravens fly in pairs to a great height making a deep loud noise different from that of their usual croaking  the carrioncrow resembles the raven in its appetites its laying and manner of bringing up its young it only differs in being less bold less docile and less favored by mankind  the rook leads the way in another but a more harmless train that have no carnivorous appetites but only feed upon insects and corn the royston crow is about the size of the two former the breast belly back and upper part of the neck being of a pale ash color the head and wings glossed over with a fine blue he is a bird of passage visiting this kingdom in the beginning of winter and leaving it in the spring he breeds however in different parts of the british dominions and his nest is common enough in trees in ireland the jackdaw is black like all the former but ashcolored on the breast and belly he is not above the size of a pigeon he is docile and loquacious his head being large for the size of his body which as has been remarked argues him ingenious and crafty he builds in steeples old castles and high rocks laying five or six eggs in a season the cornish chough is like a jackdaw but bigger and almost the size of a crow the feet and legs are long like those of a jackdaw but of a red color and the plumage is black all over it frequents rocks old castles and churches by the seaside like the daw and with the same noisy assiduity it is only seen along the western coasts of england these are birds very similar in their manners feeding on grain and insects living in society and often suffering general castigation from the flock for the good of the community  the rook as is well known builds in woods and forests in the neighborhood of man and sometimes makes choice of groves in the very midst of cities for the place of its retreat and security in these it establishes a kind of legal constitution by which all intruders are excluded from coming to live among them and none suffered to build but acknowledged natives of the place i have often amused myself with observing their plan of policy from my window in the temple that looks upon a grove where they have made a colony in the midst of the city at the commencement of spring the rookery which during the continuance of winter seemed to have been deserted or only guarded by about five or six like old soldiers in a garrison now begins to be once more frequented and in a short time all the bustle and hurry of business is fairly commenced where these numbers resided during the winter is not easy to guess perhaps in the trees of hedgerows to be nearer their food in spring however they cultivate their native trees and in the places where they were themselves hatched they prepare to propagate a future progeny  they keep together in pairs and when the offices of courtship are over they prepare for making their nests and laying the old inhabitants of the place are all already provided the nest which served them for years before with a little trimming and dressing will serve very well again the difficulty of nestling lies only upon the young ones who have no nest and must therefore get up one as well as they can but not only the materials are wanting but also the place in which to fix it every part of a tree will not do for this purpose as some branches may not be sufficiently forked others may not be sufficiently strong and still others may be too much exposed to the rockings of the wind the male and female upon this occasion are for some days seen examining all the trees of the grove very attentively and when they have fixed upon a branch that seems fit for their purpose they continue to fit upon and observe it very sedulously for two or three days longer the place being thus determined upon they begin to gather the materials for their nest such as sticks and fibrous roots which they regularly dispose in the most substantial manner but here a new and unexpected obstacle arises it often happens that the young couple have made choice of a place too near the mansion of an older pair who do not choose to be incommoded by such troublesome neighbors a quarrel therefore instantly ensues in which the old ones are always victorious  the young couple thus expelled are obliged again to go through the fatigues of deliberating examining and choosing and having taken care to keep their due distance the nest begins again and their industry deserves commendation but their alacrity is often too great in the beginning they soon grow weary of bringing the materials of their nest from distant places and they very easily perceive that sticks may be be provided nearer home with less honesty indeed but some degree of address away they go therefore to pilfer as fast as they can and wherever they see a nest unguarded they take care to rob it of the very choicest sticks of which it is composed but these thefts never go unpunished and probably upon complaint being made there is a general punishment inflicted i have seen eight or ten rooks come upon such occasions and setting upon the new nest of the young couple all at once tear it in pieces in a moment  at length therefore the young pair find the necessity of going more regularly and honestly to work while one flies to fetch the materials the other sits upon the tree to guard it and thus in the space of three or four days with a skirmish now and then between the pair have fitted up a commodious nest composed of sticks without and of fibrous roots and long grass within from the instant the female begins to lay all hostilities are at an end not one of the whole grove that a little before treated her so rudely will now venture to molest her so that she brings forth her brood with patient tranquillity such is the severity with which even native rooks are treated by each other but if a foreign rook should attempt to make himself a denizen of their society he would meet with no favor the whole grove would at once be up in arms against him and expel him without mercy  in some countries these birds are considered as a benefit in others as a nuisance their chief food is the worm of the dorbeetle and corn thus they may be said to do as much service by destroying that noxious insect as they do injury by consuming the produce of the husbandmans industry  to this tribe of the crowkind some foreign sorts might be added i will take notice only of one which from the extraordinary size and fashion of its bill must not be passed in silence this is the calao or horned indian raven which exceeds the common raven in size and habits of depredation but what he differs in from all other birds is the beak which by its length and curvature at the end appears designed for rapine but then it has a kind of horn standing out from the top which looks somewhat like a second bill and gives this bird otherwise fierce and ugly a very formidable appearance the horn springs out of the forehead and grows to the upper part of the bill being of great bulk so that near the forehead it is four inches broad not unlike the horn of the rhinoceros but more crooked at the tip were the body of the bird answerable in size to the head the calao would exceed in magnitude even the vulture or the eagle but the head and beak are out of all proportion the body being not much larger than that of a hen yet even here there are varieties for in such of those birds as come from different parts of africa the body is proportionable to the beak in such as come from the molucca islands the beak bears no proportion to the body of what use this extraordinary excrescence is to the bird is not easy to determine it lives like others of its kind upon carrion and seldom has a living enemy to cope with nature seems to sport in the production of many animals as if she were willing to exhibit instances as well of variety as economy in their formation  chap iii of the magpie and its affinities there are such a variety of birds that may be distributed under this head that we must not expect very precise ideas of any to have a straight strong bill legs formed for hopping a body of about the size of a magpie and party colored plumage are the only marks by which i must be contented to distinguish this numerous phantastic tribe that add to the beauty though not to the harmony of our landscapes in fact their chattering every where disturbs the melody of the lesser warblers and their noisy courtship not a little damps the song of the linnet and the nightingale  however we have very few of this kind in our woods compared to those in the neighborhood of the line there they not only paint the scene with the beauty and the variety of their plumage but stun the ear with their vociferation in those luxurious forests the singing birds are scarce ever heard but a hundred varieties of the pie the jay the roller the chatterer and the toucan are continually in motion and with their illusive mockeries disturb or divert the spectator as he happens to be disposed  the magpie is the chief of this kind with us and is too well known to need a description indeed were its other accomplishments equal to its beauty few birds could be put in competition its black its white its green and purple with the rich and gilded combination of the glosses on its tail are as fine as any that adorn the most beautiful of the feathered tribe but it has too many of the qualities of a beau to depreciate these natural perfections vain restless loud and quarrelsome it is an unwelcome intruder every where and never misses an opportunity when it finds one of doing mischief  the magpie bears a great resemblance to the butcherbird in its bill which has a sharp process near the end of the upper chap as well as in the shortness of its wings and the form of the tail each feather shortening from the two middlemost but it agrees still more in its food living not only upon worms and insects but also upon small birds when they can be seized a wounded lark or a young chicken separated from the hen are sure plunder and the magpie will even sometimes set upon and strike a blackbird  the same insolence prompts it to teize the largest animals when its insults can be offered with security they often are seen perched upon the back of an ox or a sheep pecking up the insects to be found there chattering and tormenting the poor animal at the same time and stretching out their necks for combat if the beast turns its head backward to reprehend them they seek out also the nests of birds and if the parent escapes the eggs make up for the deficiency the thrush and the blackbird are but too frequently robbed by this assassin and this in some measure causes their scarcity  no food seems to come amiss to this bird it shares with ravens in their carrion with rooks in their grain and with the cuckoo in birds eggs but it seems possessed of a providence seldom usual with gluttons for when it is satisfied for the present it lays up the remainder of the feast for another occasion it will even in a tame state hide its food when it has done eating and after a time return to the secret hoard with renewed appetite and vociferation  in all its habits it discovers a degree of instinct unusual to other birds its nest is not less remarkable for the manner in which it is composed than for the place the magpie takes to build it in the nest is usually placed conspicuous enough either in the middle of some hawthorn bush or on the top of some high tree the place however is always found difficult of access for the tree pitched upon usually grows in some thick hedgerow fenced by brambles at the root or sometimes one of the higher bushes is fixed upon for the purpose when the place is thus chosen as inaccessible as possible to men the next care is to fence the nest above so as to defend it from all the various enemies of air the kite the crow and the sparrowhawk are to be guarded against as their nests have been sometimes plundered by the magpie so it is reasonably feared that they will take the first opportunity to retaliate to prevent this the magpies nest is built with surprising labor and ingenuity  the body of the nest is composed of hawthorn branches the thorns sticking outward but well united together by their mutual insertions within it is lined with fibrous roots wool and long grass and then nicely plaistered all round with mud and clay the body of the nest being thus made firm and commodious the next work is to make the canopy which is to defend it above this is composed of the sharpest thorns wove together in such a manner as to deny all entrance except at the door which is just large enough to permit egress and regress to the owners in this fortress the male and female hatch and bring up their brood with security sheltered from all attacks but those of the climbing schoolboy who often finds his torn and bloody hands too dear a price for the eggs or the young ones the magpie lays six or seven eggs of a pale green color spotted with brown  this bird in its domestic state preserves its natural character with strict propriety the same noisy mischievous habits attend it to the cage that marked it in the woods and being more cunning so it is also a more docile bird than any other taken into keeping those who are desirous of teaching it to speak have a foolish custom of cutting its tongue which only puts the poor animal to pain without improving its speech in the smallest degree its speaking is sometimes very distinct but its sounds are too thin and sharp to be an exact imitation of the human voice which the hoarse raven and parrot can counterfeit more exactly  to this tribe we may refer the jay which is one of the most beautiful of the british birds the forehead is white streaked with black the head is covered with very long feathers which it can erect into a crest at pleasure the whole neck back breast and belly are of a faint purple dashed with gray the wings are most beautifully barred with a lovely blue black and white the tail is black and the feet of a pale brown like the magpie it feeds upon fruits will kill small birds and is extremely docile  the chatterer also which is a native of germany may be placed in this rank and is somewhat less than the former it is variegated with a beautiful mixture of colors red ashcolour chestnut and yellow but what distinguishes it from all other birds are the horny appendages from the tips of seven of the lesser quill feathers which stand bare of beards and have the color and gloss of the best red sealingwax  the roller is not less beautiful than any of the former the breast and belly are blue the head green and the wings variegated with blue black and white but it may be distinguished from all others by a sort of naked tubercles or warts near the eyes which still farther contribute to increase its beauty  to this class may be added a numerous list from all the tropical forests of the east and west where the birds are remarkable for discordant voices and brilliant plumage i will fix only upon one which is the most singular of all the feathered creation this is the toucan a bird of the pie kind whose bill is nearly as large as the rest of its whole body  of this extraordinary bird there are four or five varieties i will only describe the red beaked toucan and as the figure of this bird makes the principal part of its history i will follow edwards through all the minutiae of its singular conformation it is about the size of and shaped like a jackdaw with a large head to support its monstrous bill this bill from the angles of the mouth to its point is six inches and an half and its breadth in the thickest part is a little more than two its thickness near the head is one inch and a quarter and it is a little rounded along the top of the upper chap the under side being round also the whole of the bill extremely slight and a little thicker than parchment the upper chap is of a bright yellow except on each side which is of a fine scarlet color as is also the lower chap except at the base which is purple between the head and the bill there is a black line of separation all round the base of the bill in the upper part of which the nostrils are placed and are almost covered with feathers which has occasioned some writers to say that the toucan has no nostrils round the eyes on each side of the head is a space of bluish skin void of feathers above which the head is black except a white spot on each side joining to the base of the upper chap the hinder part of the neck the back wings tail belly and thighs are black the under side of the head throat and the beginning of the breast are white between the white on the breast and the black on the belly is a space of red feathers in the form of a new moon with its horns upwards the legs feet and claws are of an ash color and the toes stand like those of parrots two before and two behind  it is reported by travelers that this bird though furnished with so formidable a beak is harmless and gentle being so easily made tame as to sit and hatch its young in houses it feeds chiefly upon pepper which it devours very greedily gorging itself in such a manner that it voids it crude and unconcocted this however is no objection to the natives from using it again they even prefer it before that pepper which is fresh gathered from the tree and seem persuaded that the strength and heat of the pepper is qualified by the bird and that all its noxious qualities are thus exhausted  whatever be the truth of this report nothing is more certain than that the toucan lives only upon a vegetable diet and in a domestic state to which it is frequently brought in the warm countries where it is bred it is seen to prefer such food to all other pozzo who bred one tame asserts that it leaped up and down wagged the tail and cried with a voice resembling that of a magpie it fed upon the same things that parrots do but was most greedy of grapes which being plucked off one by one and thrown in the air it would most dexterously catch before they fell to the ground its bill he adds was hollow and upon that account very light so that it had but little strength in so apparently formidable a weapon nor could it peck or strike smartly therewith but its tongue seemed to assist the efforts of this unwieldy machine it was long thin and flat not unlike one of the feathers on the neck of a dunghill cock this it moved up and down and often extended five or six inches from the bill it was of a flesh color and very remarkably fringed on each side with very small filaments exactly resembling a feather  it is probable that this long tongue has greater strength than the thin hollow beak that contains it it is likely that the beak is only a kind of sheath for this peculiar instrument used by the toucan not only in making itself a nest but also in obtaining its provision nothing is more certain than that this bird builds its nest in holes of trees which have been previously scooped out for this purpose and it is not very likely that so feeble a bill could be very serviceable in working upon such hard materials  be this as it will there is no bird secures its young better from external injury than the toucan it has not only birds men and serpents to guard against but a numerous tribe of monkies still more prying mischievous and hungry than all the rest the toucan however scoops out its nest into the hollow of some tree leaving only a hole large enough to go in and out at there it sits with its great beak guarding the entrance and if the monkey ventures to offer a visit of curiosity the toucan gives him such a welcome that he presently thinks proper to pack off and is glad to escape with safety  this bird is only found in the warm climates of south america where it is in great request both for the delicacy of its flesh which is tender and nourishing and for the beauty of its plumage particularly the feathers of the breast the skin of this part the indians pluck off and when dry glue to their cheeks and this they consider as an irresistible addition to their beauty  chap iv of the woodpecker and its affinities we come now to the numerous tribe of woodpeckers a class easily distinguishable from all others both for their peculiar formation their method of procuring food and their manner of providing a place of safety for their young indeed no other class of birds seems more immediately formed for the method of life they pursue being fitted by nature at all points for the peculiarity of their condition they live chiefly upon the insects contained in the body of trees and for this purpose are furnished with a straight hard strong angular and sharp bill made for piercing and boring they have a tongue of a very great length round ending in a sharp stiff bony thorn dentated on each side to strike ants and insects when dislodged from their cells their legs are short and strong for the purposes of climbing their toes stand two forward and two backward which is particularly serviceable in holding by branches of trees they have hard stiff tails to lean upon when climbing they feed only upon insects and want that intestine which anatomists call the caecum a circumstance peculiar to this tribe only  of this bird there are many kinds and many varieties in each kind they form large colonies in the forests of every part of the world they differ in size color and appearance and agree only in the marks abovementioned or in those habits which result from so peculiar a conformation instead therefore of descending into a minute discrimination of every species let us take one for a pattern to which all the rest will be found to bear the strongest affinity words can but feebly describe the plumage of a bird but it is the province of history to enter into a detail of every animals pursuits and occupations  the green woodspite or woodpecker is called the rainfowl in some parts of the country because when it makes a greater noise than ordinary it is supposed to foretell rain it is about the size of a jay the throat breast and belly are of a pale greenish color and the back neck and covert feathers of the wings are green but the tongue of this little animal makes its most distinguished characteristic as it serves for its support and defense as was said above the woodpecker feeds upon insects and particularly on those which are lodged in the body of hollow or of rotting trees the tongue is its instrument for killing and procuring this food which cannot be found in great plenty this is round ending in a stiff sharp bony tip dentated on both sides like the beard of an arrow and this it can dart out three or four inches from the bill and draw in again at pleasure its prey is thus transfixed and drawn into the bill which when swallowed the dart is again launched at fresh game nothing has employed the attention of the curious in this part of anatomy more than the contrivance by which the tongue of this bird performs its functions with such great celerity the tongue is drawn back into the bill by the help of two small round cartilages fastened into the fore mentioned bony tip and running along the length of the tongue these cartilages from the root of the tongue take a circuit beyond the ears and being reflected backwards to the crown of the head make a large bow the muscular spongy flesh of the tongue encloses these cartilages like a sheath and is so made that it may be extended or contracted like a worm the cartilages indeed have muscles accompanying them along their whole length backwards but there is still another contrivance for there is a broad muscle joining the cartilages to the bones of the skull which by contracting or dilating forces the cartilages forward through the tongue and then forces the tongue and all through the bill to be employed for the animals preservation in piercing its prey  such is the instrument with which this bird is provided and this is the manner in which this instrument is employed when a woodpecker by its natural sagacity finds out a rotten hollow tree where there are worms ants eggs or insects it immediately prepares for its operations resting by its strong claws and leaning on the thick feathers of its tail it begins to bore with its sharp strong beak until it discloses the whole internal habitation upon this either through pleasure at the sight of its prey or with a desire to alarm the insect colony it sends forth a loud cry which throws terror and confusion into the whole insect tribe they creep hither and thither seeking for safety while the bird luxuriously feasts upon them at leisure darting its tongue with unerring certainty and devouring the whole brood  the woodpecker however does not confine its depredations solely to trees but sometimes lights upon the ground to try its fortune tune at an anthill it is not so secure of prey there as in the former case although the numbers are much greater they lie generally too deep for the bird to come at them and it is obliged to make up by stratagem the defect of power the woodpecker first goes to their hills which it pecks in order to call them abroad it then thrusts out its long red tongue which being like a worm and resembling their usual prey the ants come out to settle upon in great numbers however the bird watching the properest opportunity withdraws its tongue at a jerk and devours the devourers this stratagem it continues till it has alarmed their fears or till it is quite satisfied  as the wood pecker is obliged to make holes in trees to procure food so is it also to make cavities still larger to form its nest and to lay in this is performed as usual with the bill although some have affirmed that the animal uses its tongue as a gimblet to bore with but this is a mistake and those that are curious may often hear the noise of the bill making its way in large woods and forests the woodpecker chooses however for this purpose trees that are decayed or wood that is soft like beech elm and poplar in these with very little trouble it can make holes as exactly round depiction of tropical birds and their nestbuilding tropical birds and their manner of building their nests de seve del isc tailor sculp as a mathematician could with compasses one of these holes the bird generally chooses for its own use to nestle and bring up its young in but as they are easily made it is delicate in its choice and often makes twenty before one is found fit to give entire satisfaction of those which it has made and deserted other birds not so good borers and less delicate in their choice take possession the jay and the starling lay their eggs in these holes and bats are now and then found in peaceable possession boys sometimes have thrust in their hands with certain hopes of plucking out a birds egg but to their great mortification have had their fingers bitten by a bat at the bottom  the woodpecker takes no care to line its nest with feathers or straw its eggs are deposited in the hole without any thing to keep them warm except the heat of the parents body their number is generally five or six always white oblong and of a middle size when the young are excluded and before they leave the nest they are adorned with a scarlet plumage under the throat which adds to their beauty  in our climate this bird is contented with such a wainscot habitation as has been described for its young but in the warmer regions of guinea and brasil they take a very different method to protect and hatch their nascent progeny a traveller who walks into the forests of those countries among the first strange objects that excite curiosity is struck with the multitude of birdsnests hanging at the extremity of almost every branch many other kind of birds build in this manner but the chief of them are of the woodpecker kind and indeed there is not in the whole history of nature a more singular instance of the sagacity of those little animals in protecting themselves against such enemies as they have most occasion to fear in cultivated countries a great part of the caution of the feathered tribe is to hide or defend their nests from the invasions of man as he is their most dreaded enemy but in the depth of those remote and solitary forests where man is but seldom seen the little bird has nothing to apprehend from man the parent is careless how much the nest is exposed to general notice satisfied if it be out of the reach of those rapacious creatures that live by robbery and surprise if the monkey or the snake can be guarded against the bird has no other enemies to fear for this purpose its nest is built upon the depending points of the most outward branches of a tall tree such as the banana or the plantane on one of those immense trees is seen the most various and the most inimical assemblage of creatures that can be imagined the top is inhabited by monkies of some particular tribe that drive off all others lower down twine about the great trunk numbers of the larger snakes patiently waiting till some unwary animal comes within the sphere of their activity and at the edges of the tree hang these artificial nests in great abundance inhabited by birds of the most delightful plumage  the nest is usually formed in this manner when the time of incubation approaches they fly busily about in quest of a kind of moss called by the english inhabitants of those countries old mans beard it is a fibrous substance and not very unlike hair which bears being molded into any form and suffers being glued together this therefore the little woodpecker called by the natives of brasil the guiratemga first glues by some viscous substance gathered in the forest to the extremest branch of a tree then building downward and still adding fresh materials to those already procured a nest is formed that depends like a pouch from the point of the branch the hole to enter at is on the side and all the interior parts are lined with the finer fibers of the same substance which compose the whole  such is the general contrivance of these hanging nests which are made by some other birds with still superior art a little bird of the grosbeak kind in the philippine islands makes its nest in such a manner that there is no opening but from the bottom at the bottom the bird enters and goes up through a funnel like a chimney till it comes to the real door of the nest which lies on one side and only opens into this funnel  some birds glue their nest to the leaf of the bananatree which makes two sides of their little habitation while the other two are artificially composed by their own industry but these and all of the kind are built with the same precautions to guard the young against the depredations of monkies and serpents which abound in every tree the nest hangs there before the spoilers a tempting object which they can only gaze upon while the bird flies in and out without danger or molestation from so formidable a vicinity  chap v of the bird of paradise and its varieties depiction of birds of paradise and the guinea fowl     birds of paradise the guinea fowl  de seve del isc tailor sculp   there are few birds that have more deceived and puzzled the learned than this some have described it as an inhabitant of the air living only upon the dew of heaven and never resting below others have acquiesced in the latter part of its history but have given it flying insects to feed on some have asserted that it was without feet and others have ranked it among the birds of prey  the great beauty of this birds plumage and the deformity of its legs seem to have given rise to most of these erroneous reports the native savages of the molucca islands of which it is an inhabitant were very little studious of natural history and perceiving the inclination the europeans had for this beautiful bird carefully cut off its legs before they brought it to market thus concealing its greatest deformity they considered themselves entitled to rise in their demands when they offered it for sale one deceit led on to another the buyer finding the bird without legs naturally enquired after them and the seller as naturally began to assert that it had none thus far the european was imposed upon by others in all the rest he imposed upon himself seeing so beautiful a bird without legs he concluded that it could live only in air where legs were unnecessary the extraordinary splendor of its plumage assisted this deception and as it had heavenly beauty so it was asserted to have an heavenly residence from thence its name and all the false reports that have been propagated concerning it  error however is shortlived and time has discovered that this bird not only has legs but very large strong ones for its size credulity when undeceived runs into the opposite extreme and soon after this harmless bird was branded with the character of being rapacious of destroying all those of smaller size and from the amazing rapidity of its flight as qualified peculiarly for extensive rapine the real history of this pretty animal is at present tolerably well known and it is found to be as harmless as it is beautiful  there are two kinds of the bird of paradise one about the size of a pigeon which is more common the other not much larger than a lark which has been described more imperfectly they are both sufficiently distinguished from all other birds not only by the superior vivacity of their tints but by the feathers of the tail there being two long slender filaments growing from the upper part of the rump these are longer than the birds body and bearded only at the end by this mark the bird of paradise may be easily known but still more easily by its gaudy livery which being so very brilliant demands to be minutely described  this bird appears to the eye as large as a pigeon though in reality the body is not much greater than that of a thrush the tail which is about six inches is as long as the body the wings are large compared with the birds other dimensions the head the throat and the neck are of a pale gold color the base of the bill is surrounded by black feathers as also the side of the head and throat as soft as velvet and changeable like those on the neck of a mallard the hinder part of the head is of a shining green mixed with gold the body and wings are chiefly covered with beautiful brown purple and gold feathers the uppermost part of the tail feathers are of a pale yellow and those under them white and longer than the former for which reason the hinder part of the tail appears to be all white but what chiefly excites curiosity are the two long naked feathers abovementioned which spring from the upper part of the rump above the tail and which are usually about three feet long these are bearded only at the beginning and the end the whole shaft for above two feet nine inches being of a deep black while the feathered extremity is of a changeable color like the mallards neck  this bird which for beauty exceeds all others of the pie kind is a native of the molucca islands but found in greatest numbers in that of aro there in the delightful and spicy woods of the country do these beautiful creatures fly in large flocks so that the groves which produce the richest spices produce the finest birds also the inhabitants themselves are not insensible of the pleasure these afford and give them the name of gods birds as being superior to all others that he has made they live in large flocks and at night generally perch upon the same tree they are called by some the swallows of ternate from their rapid flight and from their being continually on the wing in pursuit of insects their usual prey  as the country where they are bred has its tempestuous season when rains and thunders continually disturb the atmosphere these birds are then but seldom seen it is thought that they then fly to other countries where their food appears in greater abundance for like swallows they have their stated times of return in the beginning of the month of august they are seen in great numbers flying together and as the inhabitants would have us believe following their king who is distinguished from the rest by the luster of his plumage and that respect and veneration which is paid him in the evening they perch upon the highest trees of the forest particularly one which bears a red berry upon which they sometimes feed when other food fails them in what manner they breed or what may be the number of their young as yet remains for discovery  the natives who make a trade of killing and selling these birds to the europeans generally conceal themselves in the trees where they resort and having covered themselves up from sight in a bower made of the branches they shoot at the birds with reedy arrows and as they assert if they happen to kill the king they then have a good chance for killing the greatest part of the flock the chief mark by which they know the king is by the ends of the feathers in his tail which have eyes like those of a peacock when they have taken a number of these birds their usual method is to gut them and cut off their legs they then run a hot iron into the body which dries up the internal moisture and filling the cavity with salts and spices they sell them to the europeans for a perfect trifle  chap vi the cuckoo and its varieties from a bird of which many fables have been reported we pass to another that has not given less scope to fabulous invention the note of the cuckoo is known to all the world the history and nature of the bird itself still remains in great obscurity that it devours its parent that it changes its nature with the season and becomes a sparrowhawk were fables invented of this bird and are now sufficiently refuted but where it resides in winter or how it provides for its supply during that season still continues undiscovered  this singular bird which is somewhat less than a pigeon shaped like a magpie and of a greyish color is distinguished from all other birds by its round prominent nostrils having disappeared all the winter it discovers itself in our country early in the spring by its well known call its note is heard earlier or later as the season seems to be more or less forward and the weather more or less inviting from the cheerful voice of this bird the farmer may be instructed in the real advancement of the year the fallibility of human calendars is but too well known but from this birds note the husbandman may be taught when to sow his most useful seeds and do such work as depends upon a certain temperature of the air these feathered guides come to us heaventaught and point out the true commencement of the season  the cuckoo that was silent some time after its appearance begins at first feebly and at very distant intervals to give its call which as the summer advances improves both in its frequency and loudness this is an invitation to courtship and used only by the male who sits generally perched upon some dead tree or bare bough and repeats his song which he loses as soon as the genial season is over his note is pleasant though uniform and from an association of ideas seldom occurs to the memory without reminding us of the sweets of summer custom too has affixed a more ludicrous association to this note which however we that are batchelors need be in no pain about this reproach seems to arise from this birds making use of the bed or nest of another to deposit its own brood in  however this may be nothing is more certain than that the female makes no nest of her own she repairs for that purpose to the nest of some other bird generally the waterwagtail or hedge sparrow and having devoured the eggs of the owner lays her own in their place she usually lays but one which is speckled and of the size of a blackbirds this the fond foolish bird hatches with great assiduity and when excluded finds no difference in the great illlooking changeling from her own to supply this voracious creature the credulous nurse toils with unusual labor no way sensible that she is feeding up an enemy to her race and one of the most destructive robbers of her future progeny  it was once doubted whether these birds were carnivorous but reaumur was at the pains of breeding up several and found that they would not feed upon bread or corn but flesh and insects were their favorite nourishment he found it a very difficult task to teach them to peck for he was obliged to feed them for a full month after they were grown as big as the mother insects however seemed to be their peculiar food when young for they devoured flesh by a kind of constraint as it was always put into their mouths but mealworm insects they flew to and swallowed of their own accord most greedily indeed their gluttony is not to be wondered at when we consider the capacity of their stomach which is enormous and reaches from the breast bone to the vent it is partly membranous partly muscular and of a prodigious capacity yet still they are not to be supposed as birds of prey for they have neither the strength nor the courage on the contrary they are naturally weak and fearful as appears by their flying from small birds which every where pursue them the young birds are brown mixed with black and in that state they have been described by some authors as old ones  the cuckoo when fledged and fitted for flight follows its supposed parent but for a little time its appetites for insect food increasing as it finds no great chance for a supply in imitating its little instructor it parts good friends the stepchild seldom offering any violence to its nurse nevertheless all the little birds of the grove seem to consider the young cuckoo as an enemy and revenge the cause of their kind by their repeated insults they pursue it wherever it flies and oblige it to take shelter in the thickest branches of some neighboring tree all the smaller birds form the train of its pursuers but the wryneck in particular is found the most active in the chase and from thence it has been called by many the cuckoos attendant and provider but it is very far from following with a friendly intention it only pursues as an insulter or a spy to warn all its little companions of the cuckoos depredations  such are the manners of this bird while it continues to reside or to be seen amongst us but early at the approach of winter it totally disappears and its passage can be traced to no other counrty some suppose that it lies hid in hollow trees and others that it passes into warmer climates which of these opinions is true is very uncertain as there are no facts related on either side that can be totally relied on to support the opinion that they remain torpid during the winter at home willoughby introduces the following story which he delivers upon the credit of another the servants of a gentleman in the country having stocked up in one of their meadows some old dry rotten willows thought proper on a certain occasion to carry them home in heating a stove two logs of this timber were put into the furnace beneath and fire applied as usual but soon to the great surprise of the family was heard the voice of a cuckoo singing three times from under the stove wondering at so extraordinary a cry in winter time the servants ran and drew the willow logs from the furnace and in the midst one of them saw something move wherefore taking an ax they opened the hole and thrusting in their hands first they plucked out nothing but feathers afterward they got hold of a living animal and this was the cuckoo that had waked so very opportunely for its own safety it was indeed continues our historian brisk and lively but wholly naked and bare of feathers and without any winter provision in its hole this cuckoo the boys kept two years afterward alive in the stove but whether it repaid them with a second song the author of the tale has not thought fit to inform us  the most probable opinion on this subject is that as quails and woodcocks shift their habitations in winter so also does the cuckoo but to what country it retires or whether it has been ever seen on its journey are questions that i am wholly incapable of resolving  of this bird there are many kinds in various parts of the world not only differing in their colors but their size brisson makes not less than twentyeight sorts of them but what analogy they bear to our english cuckoo i will not take upon me to determine he talks of one particularly of brasil as making a most horrible noise in the forests which as it should seem must be a very different note from that by which our bird is distinguished at home  chap vii of the parrot and its affinities the parrot is the best known among us of all foreign birds as it unites the greatest beauty with the greatest docility its voice also is more like a mans than that of any other the raven is too hoarse and the jay and magpie too shrill to resemble the truth the parrots note is of the true pitch and capable of a number of modulations that even some of our orators might wish in vain to imitate  the ease with which this bird is taught to speak and the great number of words which it is capable of repeating are no less surprising we are assured by a grave writer that one of these was taught to repeat a whole sonnet from petrarch and that i may not be wanting in my instance i have seen a parrot belonging to a distiller who had suffered pretty largely in his circumstances from an informer who lived opposite him very ridiculously employed this bird was taught to pronounce the ninth commandment thou shall not bear false witness against thy neighbor with a very clear loud articulate voice the bird was generally placed depiction of the toucan the huppoo hoopoo and the cockatoo   the toucan p       the huppoo   the cockatoo  de seve del isc tailor sculp in its cage over against the informers house and delighted the whole neighborhood with its persevering exhortations  willoughby tells a story of a parrot which is not so dull as those usually brought up when this birds facility of talking happens to be the subject a parrot belonging to king henry the seventh who then resided at westminster in his palace by the river thames had learned to talk many words from the passengers as they happened to take water one day sporting on its perch the poor bird fell into the water at the same time crying out as loud as he could a boat twenty pound for a boat a waterman who happened to be near hearing the cry made to the place where the parrot was floating and taking him up restored him to the king as it seems the bird was a favorite the man insisted that he ought to have a reward rather equal to his services than his trouble and as the parrot had cried twenty pounds he said the king was bound in honor to grant it the king at last agreed to leave it to the parrots own determination which the bird hearing cried out give the knave a groat  the parrot which is so common as a foreign bird with us is equally so as an indignous bird in the climates where it is produced the forests swarm with them and the rook is not better known with us than the parrot in almost every part of the east and western indies it is in vain that our naturalists have attempted to arrange the various species of this bird new varieties daily offer to puzzle the systemmaker or to demonstrate the narrowness of his catalogues linnaeus makes the number of its varieties amount to fortyseven while brisson doubles the number and extends his catalogue to ninetyfive perhaps even this list might be increased were every accidental change of color to be considered as constituting a new species but in fact natural history gains little by these discoveries and as its dominions are extended it becomes more barren it is asserted by sensible travelers that the natives of brasil can change the color of a parrots plumage by art if this be true and i am apt to believe the information they can make new species at pleasure and thus cut out endless work for our nomenclators at home  those who usually bring these birds over are content to make three or four distinctions to which they give names and with these distinctions i will content myself also the large kind which are of the size of a raven are called maccaws the next size are simply called parrots those which are entirely white are called lories and the lesser size of all are called parakeets the difference between even these is rather in the size than in any other peculiar conformation as they are all formed alike having toes two before and two behind for climbing and holding strong hooked bills for breaking open nuts and other hard substances on which they feed and loud harsh voices by which they fill their native woods with clamor  but there are further peculiarities in the conformation and first their toes are contrived in a singular manner which appears when they walk or climb and when they are eating for the first purpose they stretch two of their toes forward and two backward but when they take their meat and bring it to their mouths with their foot they dexterously and nimbly turn the greater hind toe forward so as to take a firmer grasp of the nut or the fruit they are going to feed on standing all the while upon the other leg nor even do they present their food in the usual manner for other animals turn their meat inwards to the mouth but these in a seemingly awkward position turn their meat outward and thus hold the hardest nuts as if in one hand till with their bills they break the shell and extract the kernel  the bill is fashioned with still greater peculiarites for the upper chap as well as the lower are both moveable in most other birds the upper chap is connected and makes but one piece with the skull but in these and in one or two species of the feathered tribe more the upper chap is connected to the bone of the head by a strong membrane placed on each side that lifts and depresses it at pleasure by this contrivance they can open their bills the wider which is not a little useful as the upper chap is so hooked and so overhanging that if the lower chap only had motion they could scarce gape sufficiently to take any thing in for their nourishment  such are the uses of the beak and the toes when used separately but they are often employed both together when the bird is exercised in climbing as these birds cannot readily hop from bough to bough their legs not being adapted for that purpose they use both the beak and the feet first catching hold with the beak as if with a hook then drawing up the legs and fastening them then advancing the head and the beak again and so putting forward the body and the feet alternately till they attain the height they aspire to  the tongue of this bird somewhat resembles that of a man for which reason some pretend that it is so well qualified to imitate the human speech but the organs by which these sounds are articulated lie farther down in the throat being performed by the great motion which the os hyoides has in these birds above others  the parrot though common enough in europe will not however breed here the climate is too cold for its warm constitution and though it bears our winter when arrived at maturity yet it always seems sensible of its rigor and loses both its spirit and appetite during the colder part of the season it then becomes torpid and inactive and seems quite changed from that bustling loquacious animal which it appeared in its native forests where it is almost ever upon the wing notwithstanding the parrot lives even with us a considerable time if it be properly attended to and indeed it must be owned that it employs but too great a part of some peoples attention  the extreme sagacity and docility of the bird may plead as the best excuse for those who spend whole hours in teaching their parrots to speak and indeed the bird on those occasions seems the wisest animal of the two it at first obstinately resists all instruction but seems to be won by perseverance makes a few attempts to imitate the first sounds and when it has got one word distinct all the succeeding come with greater facility the bird generally learns most in those families where the master or mistress have the least to do and becomes more expert in proportion as its instructors are idly assiduous in going through the towns of france sometime since i could not help observing how much plainer their parrots spoke than ours and how very distinctly i understood their parrots speak french when i could not understand our own though they spoke my native language i was at first for ascribing it to the different qualities of the two languages and was for entering into an elaborate discussion on the vowels and consonants but a friend that was with me solved the difficulty at once by assuring me that the french women scarce did any thing else the whole day than sit and instruct their feathered pupils and that the birds were thus distinct in their lessons in consequence of continual schooling  the parrots of france are certainly very expert but nothing to those of the brasils where the education of a parrot is considered as a very serious affair the history of prince maurices parrot given us by mr lock is too well known to be repeated here but clusius assures us that the parrots of that country are the most sensible and cunning of all animals not endued with reason the great parrot called the aicurous the head of which is adorned with yellow red and violet the body green the ends of the wings red the feathers of the tail long and yellow this bird he asserts which is seldom brought into europe is a prodigy of understanding a certain brasilian woman that lived in a village two miles distant from the island on which we resided had a parrot of this kind which was the wonder of the place it seemed endued with such understanding as to discern and comprehend whatever she said to it as we sometimes used to pass by that womans house she used to call upon us to stop promising if we gave her a comb or a lookingglass that she would make her parrot sing and dance to entertain us if we agreed to her request as soon as she had pronounced some words to the bird it began not only to leap and skip on the perch on which it stood but also to talk and to whistle and imitate the shoutings and exclamations of the brasilians when they prepare for battle in brief when it came into the womans head to bid it sing it sang to dance it danced but if contrary to our promise we refused to give the woman the little present agreed on the parrot seemed to sympathize in her resentment and was silent and immovable neither could we by any means provoke it to move either foot or tongue  this sagacity which parrots show in a domestic state seems also natural to them in their native residence among the woods they live together in flocks and mutually assist each other against other animals either by their courage or their notes of warning they generally breed in hollow trees where they make a round hole and do not line their nest within if they find any part of a tree beginning to rot from the breaking off a branch or any such accident this they take care to scoop and to make the hole sufficiently wide and convenient but it sometimes happens that they are content with the hole which a woodpecker has wrought out with greater ease before them and in this they prepare to hatch and bring up their young  they lay two or three eggs and probably the smaller kind may lay more for it is a rule that universally holds through nature that the smallest animals are always the most prolific for being from their natural weakness more subject to devastation nature finds it necessary to replenish the species by superior fecundity in general however the number of their eggs is stinted to two like those of the pigeon and they are about the same size they are always marked with little specks like those of a partridge and some travelers assure us that they are always found in the trunks of the tallest straightest and the largest trees the natives of these countries who have little else to do are very assiduous in spying out the places where the parrot is seen to nestle and generally come with great joy to inform the europeans if there be any of the discovery as those birds have always the greatest docility that are taken young such a nest is often considered as worth taking some trouble to be possessed of and for this purpose the usual method of coming at the young is by cutting down the tree in the fall of the tree it often happens that the young parrots are killed but if one of them survives the shock it is considered as a sufficient recompense  such is the avidity with which these birds are sought when young for it is known they always speak best when their ear has not been anticipated by the harsh notes of the wild ones but as the natives are not able upon all occasions to supply the demand for young ones they are contented to take the old and for that purpose shoot them in the woods with heavy arrows headed with cotton which knocks down the bird without killing it the parrots thus stunned are carried home some die but others recover and by kind usage and plentiful food become talkative and noisy  but it is not for the sake of their conversation alone that the parrot is sought after among the savages for though some of them are but tough and illtasted yet there are other sorts particularly of the small parakeet tribe that are very delicate food in general it obtains that whatever fruit or grain these birds mostly feed upon their flesh partakes of the flavor and becomes good or ill tasted according to the quality of their particular diet when the guava is ripe they are at that season fat and tender if they feed upon the seed of the acajou their flesh contracts an agreeable flavor of garlic if they feed upon the seed of the spicy trees their flesh then tastes of cloves and cinnamon while on the contrary it is insupportably bitter if the berries they feed on are of that quality the seed of the cottontree intoxicates them in the same manner as wine does man and even wine itself is drunk by parrots as aristotle assures us by which they are thus rendered more talkative and amusing but of all food they are fondest of the carthamus or bastard saffron which though strongly purgative to man agrees perfectly with their constitution and fattens them in a very short time  of the parakeet kind in brasil labat assures us that they are the most beautiful in their plumage and the most talkative birds in nature they are very tame and appear fond of mankind they seem pleased with holding parley with him they never have done but while he continues to talk answer him and appear resolved to have the last word but they are possessed of another quality which is sufficient to put an end to this association their flesh is the most delicate imaginable and highly esteemed by those who are fonder of indulging their appetites than their ears the fowler walks into the woods where they keep in abundance but as they are green and exactly the color of the leaves among which they sit he only hears their prattle without being able to see a single bird he looks round him sensible that his game is within gunshot in abundance but is mortified to the last degree that it is impossible to see them unfortunately for these little animals they are restless and ever on the wing so that in flying from one tree to another he has but too frequent opportunities of destroying them for as soon as they have stripped the tree on which they sat of all its berries some one of them flies off to another and if that be found fit for the purpose it gives a loud call which all the rest resort to that is the opportunity the fowler has long been waiting for he fires in among the flock while they are yet on the wing and he seldom fails of bringing down a part of them but it is singular enough to see them when they find their companions fallen they set up a loud outcry as if they were chiding their destroyer and do not cease till they see him preparing for a second charge  but though there are so many motives for destroying these beautiful birds they are in very great plenty and in some countries on the coast of guinea they are considered by the negroes as their greatest tormentors the flocks of parrots persecute them with their unceasing screaming and devour whatever fruits they attempt to produce by art in their little gardens in other places they are not so destructive but sufficiently common and indeed there is scarce a country of the tropical climates that has not many of the common kinds as well as same peculiarly its own travelers have counted more than an hundred different kinds on the continent of africa only there is one country in particular north of the cape of good hope which takes its name from the multitude of parrots which are seen in its woods there are white parrots seen in the burning regions of ethiopia in the east indies they are of the largest size in southamerica they are docile and talkative in all the islands of the pacific sea and the indian ocean they swarm in great variety and abundance and add to the splendor of those woods which nature has dressed in eternal green  so generally are these birds known at present and so great is their variety that nothing seems more extraordinary than that there was but one sort of them known among the ancients and that at a time when they pretended to be masters of the world if nothing else could serve to show the vanity of a romans boast the parrottribe might be an instance of which there are an hundred kinds now known not one of which naturally breeds in the countries that acknowledged the roman power the green parakeet with a red neck was the first of this kind that was brought into europe and the only one that was known to the ancients from the time of alexander the great to the age of nero this was brought from india and when afterward the romans began to seek and and rummage through all their dominions for new and unheard of luxuries they at last found out others in gaganda an island of ethiopia which they considered as an extraordinary discovery  parrots have usually the same disorders with other birds and they have one or two peculiar to their kind they are sometimes struck by a kind of apoplectic blow by which they fall from their perches and for a while seem ready to expire the other is the growing of the beak which becomes so very much hooked as to deprive them of the power of eating these infirmities however do not hinder them from being longlived for a parrot well kept will live five or six and twenty years  chap viii the pigeon and its varieties this is one of the birds which from its great fecundity we have in some measure reclaimed from a state of nature and taught to live in habits of dependence indeed its fecundity seems to be increased by human cultivation since those pigeons that live in a wild state in the woods are by no means so fruitful as those in our pigeonhouses nearer home the power of increase in most birds depends upon the quantity of their food and it is seen in more than one instance that man by supplying food in plenty and allowing the animal at the same time a proper share of freedom has brought some of those kinds which are known to lay but once a year to become much more prolific  the tame pigeon and all its beautiful varieties derive their origin from one species the stock dove only the english name implying its being the stock or stem from whence the other domestic kinds have been propagated this bird in its natural state is of a deep blueish ash color the breast dashed with a fine changeable green and purple its wings marked with two black bars the back white and the tail barred near the end with black these are the colors of the pigeon in a state of nature and from these simple tints has man by art propagated a variety that words cannot describe nor even fancy suggest however nature still perseveres in her great outline and though the form color and even the fecundity of these birds may be altered by art yet their natural manners and inclinations continue still the same  the stockdove in its native woods differs from the ringdove a bird that has never been reclaimed by its breeding in the holes of rocks and the hollows of trees all other birds of the pigeonkind build like rooks in the topmost branches of the forest and choose their habitation as remote as possible from man but this species soon takes to build in artificial cavities and from the temptation of a ready provision and numerous society easily submits to the tyranny of man still however it preserves its native color for several generations and becomes more variegated only in proportion as it removes from the original simplicity of its coloring in the woods  the dovehouse pigeon as is well known breeds every month but then it is necessary to supply it with food when the weather is severe or the fields are covered with snow upon other occasions it may be left to provide for itself and it generally repays the owner for his protection the pigeon lays two white eggs which most usually produce young ones of different sexes for the laying of each egg it is necessary to have a particular congress with the male and the egg is usually deposited in the afternoon when the eggs are thus laid the female in the space of fifteen days not including the three days during which she is employed in laying continues to hatch relieved at intervals by the male the turns are usually regulated with great exactness from three or four oclock in the evening till nine the next day the female continues to sit she is then relieved by the male who takes his place from ten till three while his mate is feeding abroad in this manner they sit alternately till the young are excluded if during this term the female delays to return at the expected time the male follows and drives her to the nest and should he in his turn be dilatory she retaliates with equal severity  the young ones when hatched require no food for the three first days only wanting to be kept warm which is an employment the female takes entirely upon herself during this period she never stirs out except for a few minutes to take a little food from this they are fed for eight or ten days with corn or grain of different kinds which the old ones gather in the fields and keep treasured up in their crops from whence they throw it up again into the mouths of their young ones who very greedily demand it  as this method of feeding the young from the crop is different in birds of the pigeonkind from all others it demands a more detailed explanation of all birds for its size the pigeon has the largest crop which is also made in a manner quite peculiar to the kind in two of these that were dissected by a member of the royal academy of sciences it was found that if the anatomist blew air into the windpipe it distended the crop or gullet to a prodigious size this was the more extraordinary as there seemed to be no communication whatsoever between these two receptacles as the conduit by which we breathe as every one knows leads to a very different receptacle from that where we put our food by what apertures the air blown into the lungs of the pigeon makes its way into the crop is unknown but nothing is more certain than that these birds have a power of filling the crop with air and some of them which are called croppers distend it in such a manner that the birds breast seems bigger than its body the peculiar mechanism of this part is not well known but the necessity for it in these animals is pretty obvious the pigeon as we all know lives entirely upon grain and water these are mixed together in the crop and in the ordinary way are digested in proportion as the bird lays in its provision but to feed its young which are very voracious it is necessary to lay in a store greater than ordinary and to give the food a kind of half maceration to suit their tender appetites the heat of the birds body assisted by air and numerous glands separating a milky fluid are the most necessary instruments for this operation but in proportion as the food macerates it begins to swell also and the crop must of consequence be considerably dilated still however the air which is contained in it gives the bird a power of contracting it at pleasure for if it were filled with more solid substances the bird could have no power to compress it but this is not the case the bird can compress its crop at pleasure and driving out the air can thus drive out the food also which is forced up the gullet like a pellet from a popgun the young ones openmouthed receive this tribute of affection and are thus fed three times a day in feeding the male usually supplies the young female while the old female supplies the young of the opposite sex the food with which they are supplied is more macerated in the beginning but as they grow older the parents give it less preparation and at last drive them out to shift for themselves when well fed however the old ones do not wait for the total dismission of their young but in the same nest are to be found young ones almost fit for flight and eggs hatching at the same time  the fidelity of the turtledove is proverbial and makes the usual comparison of such poets as are content to repeat what others have said before them but the pigeon of the dovehouse is not so faithful and having been subjected to man it puts on licentiousness among its other domestic habits two males are often seen quarreling for the same mistress and when the female admits the addresses of a new gallant her old companion seems to bear the contempt with some marks of displeasure abstains from her company or if he approaches it is only to chastise her there have been instances when two males being displeased with their respective mates have thought proper to make an exchange and have lived in great harmony with their new companions  so great is the produce of this bird in its domestic state that near fifteen thousand may in the space of four years be produced from a single pair but the stockdove seldom breeds above twice a year for when the winter months come the whole employment of the fond couple is rather for selfpreservation than transmitting a posterity they seem however to have a stronger attachment to their young than those who are found to breed so often whether it be that instinct acts more powerfully upon them in their state of nature or that their affections are less divided by the multiplicity of claims  it is from a species of these therefore that those pigeons which are called carriers and are used to convey letters are produced these are easily distinguished from all others by their eyes which are compassed about with a broad circle of naked white skin and by being of a dark blue or blackish color it is from their attachment to their native place and particularly where they have brought up their young that these birds are employed in several countries as the most expeditious carriers they are first brought from the place where they were bred and whither it is intended to send them back with information the letter is tied under the birds wing and it is then let loose to return the little animal no sooner finds itself at liberty than its passion for its native spot directs all its motions it is seen upon these occasions flying directly into the clouds to an amazing height and then with the greatest certainty and exactness directing itself by some surprising instinct toward home which lies sometimes at many miles distance bringing its message to those to whom it is directed by what marks they discover the place by what chart they are guided in the right way is to us utterly unknown certain it is that in the space of an hour and an half they perform a journey of forty miles which is a degree of dispatch three times greater than the fleetest quadrupede can perform these birds are not brought up at present with as much care as formerly when they were sent from governors in a besieged city to generals that were coming to relieve it without when they were sent from princes to their subjects with the tidings of some fortunate event or from lovers to their mistresses with expressions of their passion the only use we now see made of them is to be let fly at tyburn when the cart is drawn away pretty much as when some ancient hero was to be interred an eagle was let off from the funeral pile to complete his apotheosis  the varieties of the tame pigeon are so numerous that it would be a vain attempt to mention them so much is the figure and the color of this bird under human control that pigeonfanciers by coupling a male and female of different sorts can breed them as they express it to a feather from hence we have the various names of croppers carriers jacobines powters runts and turbits all birds that at first might have accidentally varied from the stockdove and then by having these varieties still heightened by food climate and paring different species have been produced but there are many species of the wild pigeon which though bearing a strong affinity to the stockdove are nevertheless sufficiently different from it to deserve a distinct description the ringdove is of this number a good deal larger than the former and building its nest with a few dry sticks in the boughs of trees this seems a bird much fonder of its native freedom than the former and attempts have been frequently made to render it domestic but they have hitherto proved fruitless for though their eggs have been hatched by the tame pigeon in a dovehouse yet as soon as they could fly they always betook themselves to the woods where they were first produced in the beginning of winter these assemble in great flocks in the woods and leave off cooing nor do they resume this note of courtship till the beginning of march when the genial season by supplying them with food renews their desires  the turtledove is a smaller but a much shyer bird than any of the former it may easily be distinguished from the rest by the iris of the eye which is of a fine yellow and by a beautiful crimson circle that encompasses the eyelids the fidelity of these birds is noted and a pair being put in a cage if one dies the other will not survive it the turtledove is a bird of passage and few or none remain in our northern climates in winter they fly in flocks when they come to breed here in summer and delight in open mountainous sandy countries but they build their nests in the midst of woods and choose the most retired situations for incubation they feed upon all sorts of grain but are fondest of milletseed  to this short list might be added a long catalogue of foreign pigeons of which we know little more than the plumage and the names indeed the variety of their plumage is as beautiful as the names by which they are known are harsh and dissonant the ocotzimtzcan for instance is one of the most splendid tenants of the mexican forests but few i believe would desire to learn the name only to be informed that it is covered with purple green and yellow plumage to describe such birds the historians pen is not half such an useful implement as the painters pencil  part iv of birds of the sparrow kind chap i of birds of the sparrow kind in general still descending from the larger to the smaller we come to birds of the sparrow kind or that class of beautiful little animals that being less than the pigeon go on diminishing till we arrive at the hummingbird the smallest of the feathered creation  the birds which compose this class chiefly live in the neighborhood of man and are his greatest favorites the falcon may be more esteemed and the turkey more useful but these he considers as servants not as friends as animals reclaimed merely to supply him with some of the conveniences of life but these little painted songsters have his affections as well from their beauty as their melody it is this delightful class that fill his groves with harmony and lift his heart to sympathize with their raptures all the other classes are either mute or screaming it is this diminutive tribe only that have voices equal to the beauty of their figures equally adapted to rejoice man and delight each other  as they are the favorites of man so they are chiefly seen near him all the great birds dread his vicinity and keep to the thickest darkness of the forest or the brow of the most craggy precipice but these seldom resort to the thicker parts of the wood they keep near its edges in the neighborhood of cultivated fields in the hedgerows of farmgrounds and even in the yard mixing with the poultry  it must be owned indeed that their living near man is not a society of affection on their part as they approach inhabited grounds merely because their chief provision is to be found there in the depth of the desert or the gloom of the forest there is no grain to be picked up none of these tender buds that are so grateful to their appetites insects themselves that make so great a part of their food are not found there in abundance their natures being unsuited to the moisture of the place as we enter therefore deeper into uncultivated woods the silence becomes more profound every thing carries the look of awful stillness there are none of those warblings none of those murmurs that awaken attention as near the habitations of men there is nothing of that confused buzz formed by the united though distant voices of quadrupedes and birds but all is profoundly dead and solemn now and then indeed the traveller may be rouzed from this lethargy of life by the voice of an heron or the scream of an eagle but his sweet little friends and warblers have totally forsaken him  there is still another reason for these little birds avoiding the depths of the forest which is that their most formidable enemies usually reside there the greater birds like robbers choose the most dreary solitudes for their retreats and if they do not find they make a desert all around them the smallbirds fly from their tyranny and take protection in the vicinity of man where they know their more unmerciful foes will not venture to pursue them  all birds even those of passage seem content with a certain district to provide food and center in the redbreast or the wren seldom leaves the field where it has been brought up or where its young have been excluded even though hunted it flies along the hedge and seems fond of the place with an imprudent perseverance the fact is all these small birds mark out a territory to themselves which they will permit none of their own species to remain in they guard their dominions with the most watchful resentment and we seldom find two male tenants in the same hedge together  thus though fitted by nature for the most wandering life these little animals do not make such distant excursions during the season of their stay as the stag or the leveret food seems to be the only object that puts them in motion and when that is provided for them in sufficient plenty they never wander but as that is seldom permanent through the year almost every bird is then obliged to change its abode some are called birds of passage because they are obliged to take long journeys for this purpose but strictly speaking almost every other kind are birds of passage though their migration may not be to places so remote at some particular season of the year all small birds migrate either from one county to another or from the more inland provinces toward the shore  there are several persons who get a livelihood by watching the seasons when our small birds begin to migrate from one county to another and by taking them with nets in their passage the birds are found to fly as the birdcatchers term it chiefly during the month of october and part of september and november there is also another flight in march which is much less considerable than that in autumn nor is it less remarkable that several of these species of flightbirds make their appearance in regular succession the pippit for instance begins its flight every year about michaelmas when they are caught in greatest number to this the woodlark succeeds and continues its flight till toward the middle of october other birds follow but are not so punctually periodical the greenfinch does not begin till the frost obliges it to seek for a change these birds during those months fly from daybreak till twelve at noon and there is afterward a small flight from two till night such are the seasons of the migration of the birds which have been usually considered as stationary and on these occasions they are caught in great abundance as they are on their journey but the same arts used to allure them upon other occasions would be utterly fruitless as they avoid the nets with the most prudent circumspection the autumnal flight probably consists of the parents conducting their newfledged young to those places where there is sufficient provision and a proper temperament of the air during the winter season and their return in spring is obviously from an attachment to the place which was found so convenient before for the purposes of nestling and incubation  autumn is the principal season when the birdcatcher employs his art to catch these wanderers his nets are a most ingenious piece of mechanism being generally twelve yards and a half long and two yards and a half wide and so contrived as from a flat position to rise on each side and clap over the birds that are decoyed to come between them the birds in their passage are always observed to fly against the wind hence there is a great contention among the birdcatchers which shall gain the wind for example if it is westerly the birdcatcher who lays his nets most to the east is sure of the most plentiful sport if his callbirds are good for this purpose he generally carries five or six linnets two goldfinches two greenfinches one woodlark one redpoll and perhaps a bullfinch a yellowhammer a titlark and an aberdavine these are placed at small distances from the nets in little cages he has besides what he calls his flurbirds which are placed upon a moveable perch which the birdcatcher can raise at pleasure by means of a string and these he always lifts gently up and down as the wild bird approaches but this is not enough to allure the wild bird down it must be called by one of the callbirds in the cages and these by being made to moult prematurely in a warm cage call louder and better than those that are wild and at freedom there even appears a malicious joy in these callbirds to bring the wild ones into the same state of captivity while at the same time their call is louder and their plumage brighter than in a state of nature nor is their sight or hearing less exquisite far exceeding that of the birdcatcher for the instant the wild birds are perceived notice is given by one to the rest of the callbirds who all unite in the same tumultuous ecstacy of pleasure the callbirds do not sing upon these occasions as a bird does in a chamber but incite the wild ones by short jerks which when the birds are good may be heard at a great distance the allurement of this call is so great that the wild bird hearing it is stopped in its most rapid flight and if not already acquainted with the nets lights boldly within twenty yards perhaps of the birdcatcher and on a spot which it would otherwise have quite disregarded this is the opportunity wished for and the birdcatcher pulling a string the nets on each side rise in an instant and clap directly down on the poor little unsuspecting visitant nay it frequently happens that if half a flock only are caught the remaining half will immediately afterward light between the nets and share the fate of their companions should only one bird escape this unhappy survivor will also venture into danger till it is caught such a fascinating power have the callbirds  indeed it is not easy to account for the nature of this call whether it be a challenge to combat an invitation to food or a prelude to courtship as the callbirds are all males and as the wild birds that attend to their voice are most frequently males also it does not seem that love can have any influence in their assiduity perhaps the wild females in these flights attend to and obey the call below and their male companions of the flight come down to bear them company if this be the case and that the females have unfaithfully led their mates into the nets they are the first that are punished for their infidelity the males are only made captives for singing while the females are indiscriminately killed and sold to be served up to the tables of the delicate  whatever be the motives that thus arrest a flock of birds in their flight whether they be of gallantry or of war it is certain that the small birds are equally remarkable for both it is perhaps the genial desire that inspires the courage of most animals and that being greatest in the males gives them a greater degree of valor than the females small birds being extremely amorous are remarkably brave however contemptible these little warriors are to larger creatures they are often but too formidable to each other and sometimes fight till one of them yields up his life with the vlctory but their contentions are sometimes of a gentler nature two male birds shall strive in song till after a long struggle the loudest shall entirely silence the other during these contentions the female sits an attentive silent auditor and often rewards the loudest songster with her company during the season  singing among birds is almost universally the prerogative of the male with them it is the reverse of what occurs in the human kind among the feathered tribe the heaviest cares of life fall to the lot of the female hers is the fatigue of incubation and to her devolves the principal fatigue of nursing the helpless brood to alleviate these fatigues and to support her under them nature has given the song to the male this serves as a note of blandishment at first to attract her affections it serves as a note to delight her during the time of her incubation but it serves still farther as a note of security to assure her that no danger threatens to molest her the male while his mate is hatching sits upon some neighboring tree continuing at once to watch and to sing while his voice is heard the female rests in confident security and as the poet expresses it appears most blessed when most unseen but if any appearance of danger offers to intrude the male that a moment before was so loud and sportive stops all of a sudden and this is a most certain signal to his mate to provide for her own security  the nest of little birds seems to be of a more delicate contrivance than that of the larger kinds as the volume of their bodies is smaller the materials of which their nests are composed are generally warmer it is easy to conceive that small things keep heat a shorter time than those that are large the eggs therefore of small birds require a place of more constant warmth than those of great ones as being liable to cool more quickly and accordingly their nests are built warmer and deeper lined on the inside with softer substances and guarded above with a better covering but it sometimes happens that the little architects are disturbed in their operations and then they are obliged to make a nest not such as they wish but such as they can the bird whose nest has been robbed several times builds up her last in a very slovenly manner conscious that from the near approach of winter she must not take time to give her habitation every possible advantage it is capable of receiving when the nest is finished nothing can exceed the cunning which the male and female employ to conceal it if it is built in bushes the pliant branches are so disposed as to hide it entirely from the view if it be built among moss nothing outwardly appears to show that there is an habitation within it is always built near those places where food is found in greatest abundance and they take care never to go in or out while there is any one in sight the greater birds continue from their nest for some time as their eggs take no damage in their absence but the little birds are assiduous while they sit and the nest is always occupied by the male when the female is obliged to seek for sustenance  the first food of all birds of the sparrow kind is worms and insects even the sparrow and the goldfinch that when adult feed only upon grain have both been fed upon insects while in the nest the young ones for some time after their exclusion from the shell require no food but the parent soon finds by their chirping and gaping that they begin to feel the approaches of hunger and flies to provide them a plentiful supply in her absence they continue to lie close together and cherish each other by their mutual warmth during this interval also they preserve a perfect silence uttering not the slightest note till the parent returns her arrival is always announced by a chirrup which they perfectly understand and which they answer all together each petitioning for its portion the parent distributes a supply to each by turns cautiously avoiding to gorge them but to give them often though little at a time the wren will in this manner feed seventeen or eighteen young ones without passing over one of them  such is the manner in which these birds bring forth and hatch their young but it yet remains to usher them from the nest into life and this they very assiduously perform when they are fully fledged and fitted for short flights the old ones if the weather be fair lead them a few yards from the nest and then compel them to return for two or three succeeding days they are led out in the same manner but each day to seek more distant adventures when it is perceived that they can fly and shift for themselves then the parents forsake them for ever and pay them no more attention than they do to other birds in the same flock indeed it would seem among these little animals that from the moment their young are set out all future connection ceases between the male and female they go separate ways each to provide for itself during the rigours of winter and at the approach of spring each seeks for a new associate  in general birds when they come to pair in spring associate with those of their own age and place of abode their strength or courage is generally in proportion to their age the oldest females first feel the accesses of desire and the oldest males are the boldest to drive off all younger pretenders those next in courage and desire become pretenders till they are almost all provided in turn the youngest come last as in fact they are the latest in their inclinations but still there are several both males and females that remain unprovided for either not happening to meet with each other or at least not during the genial interval whether these mix with small birds of a different species is a doubt which naturalists have not been able thoroughly to resolve addison in some beautiful latin lines inserted in the spectator is entirely of opinion that birds observe a strict chastity of manners and never admit the caresses of a different tribe  chaste are their instincts faithful is their fire no foreign beauty tempts to false desire the snowwhite vesture and the glittering crown the simple plumage or the glossy down prompt not their love the patriot bird pursues his well acquainted tints and kindred hues hence through their tribes no mixed polluted flame no monster breed to mark the groves with shame but the chaste blackbird to its partner true thinks black alone is beautys favorite hue the nightingale with mutual passion blessed sings to its mate and nightly charms the nest while the dark owl to court his partner flies and owns his offspring in their yellow eyes but whatever may be the poets opinion the probability is against this fidelity among the smaller tenants of the grove the great birds are much more true to their species than these and of consequence the varieties among them are more few of the ostrich the cassowary and the eagle there are but few species and no arts that man can use could probably induce them to mix with each other  but it is otherwise with the small birds we are describing it requires very little trouble to make a species between a goldfinch and a canarybird between a linnet and a lark they breed frequently together and produce a race not like the mules among quadrupedes incapable of breeding again for this motley mixture are as fruitful as their parents what is so easily done by art very probably often happens in a state of nature and when the male cannot find a mate of his own species he flies to one of another that like him has been left out in pairing this some historians think may have given rise to the great variety of small birds that are seen among us some uncommon mixture might first have formed a new species and this might have been continued down by birds of this species choosing to breed together  whether the great variety of our small birds may have arisen from this source cannot now be ascertained but certain it is that they resemble each other very strongly not only in their form and plumage but also in their appetites and manner of living the goldfinch the linnet and the yellowhammer though obviously of different species yet lead a very similar life being equally an active lively salacious tribe that subsist by petty thefts upon the labors of mankind and repay them with a song their nests bear a similitude and they are all about the same time in hatching their young which is usually fifteen days were i therefore to describe the manners of these with the same minuteness that i have done the greater birds i should only present the reader with a repetition of the same accounts animated neither by novelty nor information instead therefore of specifying each sort i will throw them into groupes uniting those together that practice the same manners or that are remarkable for similar qualifications  willaughby has divided all the smaller birds into those that have slender bills and those that have short and thick bills those with slender bills chiefly live upon insects those with short strong bills live mostly upon fruits and grain among slender billed birds he enumerates the thrush the blackbird the fieldfare the starling the lark the titmouse the waterwagtail the nightingale the redstart the robin redbreast the beccafigo the stonechatter the whinchat the goldfinch the whitethroat the hedgesparrow the pettichaps the golden crowned wren the wren the hummingbird and several other small birds of the sparrow kind unknown in this part of the world  all these as was said live for the most part upon insects and are consequently of particular benefit to man by these are his grounds cleared of the pernicious swarms of vermin that devour the budding leaves and flowers and that even attack the root itself before ever the vegetable can come to maturity these seek for and destroy the eggs of insects that would otherwise propagate in numbers beyond the arts of man to extirpate they know better than man where to seek for them and thus at once satisfy their own appetites and render him the most essential services  but this is not the only merit of this tribe in it we have the sweetest songsters of the grove their notes are softer and their manner more musically soothing than those of hard billed birds the foremost in musical fame are the nightingale the thrush the blackbird the lark the redbreast the blackcap and the wren  birds of the sparrow kind with thick and short bills are the grossbeak the greenfinch the bullfinch the crossbill the housesparrow the chaffinch the brambling the goldfinch the linnet the siskin the bunting the yellowhammer the ortolan the wheatear and several other foreign birds of which we know rathe the names than the history these chiefly feed upon fruits grain and corn they are often troublesome to man as they are a numerous tribe the harvest often suffers from their depredations and while they are driven off from one end of the field they fly round and come in at the other but these also have their uses they are frequently the distributors of seeds into different districts those grains which they swallow are sometimes not wholly digested and these laid upon a soil congenial to them embellish the face of nature with that agreeable variety which art but vainly attempts to imitate the misletoe plant which we often see growing on the tops of elm and other trees has been thought to be propagated in this manner yet as it is often seen growing on the under side of the branch and sometimes on a perpendicular shoot it seems extraordinary how a seed could be deposited in that situation however this be there are many plants propagated from the depositions of birds and some seeds are thought to thrive the better for first having undergone a kind of maceration in the stomach of the little animal before it is voided on the ground  there are some agreeable songsters in this tribe also and those who like a loud piercing pipe endued with great variety and perseverance will be pleased most with their singing the songsters of this class are the canarybird the linnet the chaffinch the goldfinch the greenfinch the bullfinch the brambling the siskin and the yellowhammer the note of these is not so generally pleasing as that of the soft billed bird but it usually holds longer and in a cage these birds are more easily fed and hardy  this class of small birds like all the greater has its wanderers that leave us for a season and then return to propagate to sing or to embellish the landscape here some of this smaller kind indeed are called birds of passage that do not properly come under the denomination for though they disappear in one place they never leave the kingdom but are seen somewhere else but there are many among them that take longer flights and go to a region colder or warmer as it suits their constitutions the fieldfare and the redwing breed pass their summers in norway and other cold countries and are tempted hither to our mild winters and to those various berries which then abound with us and make their principal food the hawfinch and the crossbill are uncertain visitants and have no stated times of migration swallows of every species disappear at the approach of winter the nightingale the blackcap the flycatcher the willowwren the wheatear the whinchat and the stonechatter leave us long before the approach of winter while the siskin and the linnet only forsake us when our winters are more than usually severe all the rest of the smaller tribe never quit this country but support the severest rigours of the climate  yet it must not be supposed that the manners of our little birds prevail in all other countries and that such kinds as are stationary with us never wander in other parts of europe on the contrary it happens that many of those kinds which are birds of passage in england are seen in other places never to depart but to make one country their fixed residence the whole year round it is also frequent that some birds which with us are faithful residents in other kingdoms put on the nature of birds of passage and disappear for a season  the swallow that with us is particularly remarked for being a bird of passage in upper egypt and in the island of java breeds and continues the whole year without ever disappearing larks that remain with us the year throughout are birds of passage in sweden and forsake that climate in winter to return again with the returning spring the chaffinch that with us is stationary appears during the winter in carolina and virginia but disappears totally in summer to breed in the more northern regions in sweden also these little birds are seen returning at the approach of spring from the warmer climates to propagate which being accomplished by the latter end of autumn the males and females separate the males to continue among their native snows the females to seek a warmer and gentler winter on this occasion they are seen in flocks that darken all the air without a single male among them making their way into the more southern regions of denmark germany and holland in this amazonlike retreat thousands fall by the way some by fatigue some by want but the greatest number by the nets of the fowler the taking them being one of the chief amusements among the gentry where they pass in short the change of country with all this little tribe is rather a pilgrimage than a journey a migration rather of necessity than of choice  having thus given a general idea of the birds of this class it will be proper to give some account of the most remarkable among them  chap ii of the thrush and its affinities with the thrush we may rank the redwing the fieldfare the blackbird the ringouzel and the waterouzel  these are the largest of the sparrowkind and may be distinguished from all others of this class as well by their size which is well known as by their bills which are a little bending at the point a small notch near the end of the upper chap and the outmost toe adhering as far as the first joint of the middle toe to this tribe may be also added the stare or starling which though with a flat bill too much resembles these birds to be placed any where else  the misselthrush is distinguished from all of the kind by its superior size being much larger than any of them it differs scarcely in any other respect from the throstle except that the spots on the breast are larger it builds its nest in bushes or on the side of some tree as all of this kind are found to do and lays four or five eggs in a season its song is very fine which it begins in spring sitting on the summit of a high tree it is the largest bird of all the feathered tribe that has music in its voice the note of all greater birds being either screaming chattering or croaking it feeds on insects holly and misletoeberries and sometimes sends forth a very disagreeable scream when frighted or disturbed  the blackbird which in cold countries and particularly upon the alps is sometimes seen all over white is a beautiful and a canorous bird whistling all the spring and summertime with a note at a distance the most pleasing of all the grove it is the deepest toned warbler of the woods but it is rather unpleasant in a cage being loud and deafening it lays four or five bluish eggs in a nest usually built at the stump of some old hawthorn well plaistered on the inside with clay straw and hair  pleasing however as this bird may be the bluebird described by bellonius is in every respect far superior this beautiful animal entirely resembles a blackbird in all but its blue color it lives in the highest parts of the alps and even there chooses the most craggy rocks and the most frightful precipices for its residence as it is rarely caught it is in high estimation even in the countries where it breeds but still more valuable when carried from home it not only whistles in the most delightful manner but speaks with an articulate distinct voice it is so docile and observes all things with such diligence that though waked at midnight by any of the family it will speak and whistle at the word of command its color about the beginning of winter from blue becomes black which changes to its original hue on the first approaches of spring it makes its nest in deep holes in very high and inaccessible solitudes and removes it not only from the accesses of man but also hides it with surprising cunning from the shammoy and other wild beasts that might annoy its young  the manner of taking this beautiful bird is said to be this the fowlers either by chance or by lying in wait having found out the place where it builds take with them a strong stilt or stake such as the climbers of rocks make use of to assist them in their ascent with the assistance of this they mount where an indifferent spectator would think it impossible to ascend covering their heads at the same time to ward off any danger of the falling of pebbles or stones from above at length with extreme toil and danger having arrived at the nest they draw it up from the hole in which it is usually buried and cherish the young with an assiduity equal to the pains they took to obtain them it produces for the most part five young and never more it seldom descends into the plain country flies swifter than a blackbird and uses the same food  the fieldfare and the redwing make but a short stay in this country with us they are insipid tuneless birds flying in flocks and excessively watchful to preserve the general safety all their season of music and pleasure is employed in the more northern climates where they sing most delightfully perched among the forests of maples with which those countries abound they build their nests in hedges and lay six bluish green eggs spotted with black  the stare distinguishable from the rest of this tribe by the glossy green of its feathers in some lights and the purple in others breeds in hollow trees eaves of houses towers ruins cliffs and often in high rocks over the sea it lays four or five eggs of a pale greenish ash color and makes it nest of straw small fibers of roots and such like its voice is rougher than the rest of this kind but what it wants in the melody of its note it compensates by the facility with which it is taught to speak in winter these birds assemble in vast flocks and feed upon worms and insects at the approach of spring they assemble in fields as if in consultation together and for three or four days seem to take no nourishment the greater part leave the country the rest breed here and bring up their young  to this tribe might be added above an hundred other birds of nearly the thrush size and living like them upon fruit and berries words could not afford variety enough to describe all the beautiful tints that adorn the foreign birds of the thrush kind the brilliant green of the emerald the flaming red of the ruby the purple of the amethyst or the bright blue of the sapphire could not by the most artful combination show any thing so truly lively or delightful to the sight as the feathers of the chilcoqui or the tautotol passing therefore over these beautiful but little known birds i will only mention the american mockbird the favorite songster of a region where the birds excel rather in the beauty of their plumage than the sweetness of their notes  this valuable bird does not seem to vie with the feathered inhabitants of that country in the beauty of its plumage content with qualifications that endear it to mankind much more it is but a plain bird to the eye about the size of a thrush of a white and gray color and a reddish bill it is possessed not only of its own natural notes which are musical and solemn but it can assume the tone of every other animal in the wood from the wolf to the raven it seems even to sport itself in leading them astray it will at one time allure the lesser birds with the call of their males and then terrify them when they have come near with the screams of the eagle there is no bird in the forest but it can mimick and there is none that it has not at times deceived by its call but not like such as we usually see famed for mimicking with us and who have no particular merit of their own the mock bird is ever surest to please when it is most itself at those times it usually frequents the houses of the american planters and sitting all night on the chimneytop pours forth the sweetest and the most various notes of any bird whatever it would seem if accounts be true that the deficiency of most other songbirds in that country is made up by this bird alone they often build their nests in the fruit trees about houses feed upon berries and other fruits and are easily rendered domestic  chap iii of the nightingale and other soft billed songbirds the nightingale is not only famous among the moderns for its singing but almost every one of the ancients who undertook to describe beautiful nature has contributed to raise its reputation the nightingale says pliny that for fifteen days and nights hid in the thickest shades continues her note without intermission deserves our attention and wonder how surprising that so great a voice can reside in so small a body such perseverance in so minute an animal with what a musical propriety are the sounds it produces modulated the note at one time drawn out with a long breath now stealing off into a different cadence now interrupted by a break then changing into a new note by an unexpected transition now seeming to renew the same strain then deceiving expectation she sometimes seems to murmur within herself full deep sharp swift drawling trembling now at the top the middle and the bottom of the scale in short in that little bill seems to reside all the melody which man has vainly labored to bring from a variety of musical instruments some even seem to be possessed of a different song from the rest and contend with each other with great ardour the bird overcome is then seen only to discontinue its song with its life  this most famous of the feathered tribe visits england in the beginning of april and leaves us in august it is found but in some of the southern parts of the country being totally unknown in scotland ireland or north wales they frequent thick hedges and low coppices and generally keep in the middle of the bush so that they are rarely seen they begin their song in the evening and generally continue it for the whole night for weeks together if undisturbed they sit upon the same tree and shakespeare rightly describes the nightingale sitting nightly in the same place which i have frequently observed she seldom parts from  from plinys description we should be led to believe this bird possessed of a persevering strain but though it is in fact so with the nightingale in italy yet in our hedges in england the little songstress is by no means so liberal of her music her note is soft various and interrupted she seldom holds it without a pause above the time that one can count twenty the nightingales pausing song would be the proper epithet for this birds music with us which is more pleasing than the warbling of any other bird because it is heard at a time when all the rest are silent  in the beginning of may the nightingale prepares to make its nest which is formed of the leaves of trees straw and moss the nest being very eagerly sought after is as cunningly secreted so that but very few of them are found by the boys when they go upon these pursuits it is built at the bottom of hedges where the bushes are thickest and best covered while the female continues sitting the male at a good distance but always within hearing chears the patient hour with his voice and by the short interruption of his song often gives her warning of approaching danger she lays four or five eggs of which but a part in our cold climate come to maturity  the delicacy or rather the fame of this birds music has induced many to abridge its liberty to be secured of its song indeed the greatest part of what has been written concerning it in our country consists in directions how to manage it for domestic singing while the history of the bird is confined to dry receipts for fitting it for the cage its song however in captivity is not so very alluring and the tyranny of taking it from those hedges where only it is most pleasing still more depreciates its imprisoned efforts gesner assures us that it is not only the most agreeable songster in a cage but that it is possessed of a most admirable faculty of talking he tells the following story in proof of his assertion which he says was communicated to him by a friend whilst i was at ratisbone says his correspondent i put up at an inn the sign of the golden crown where my host had three nightingales what i am going to repeat is wonderful almost incredible and yet is true the nightingales were placed separately so that each was shut up by itself in a dark cage it happened at that time being the spring of the year when those birds are wont to sing indefatigably that i was so afflicted with the stone that i could sleep but very little all night it was usual then about midnight when there was no noise in the house but all still to hear the two nightingales jangling and talking with each other and plainly imitating mens discourses for my part i was almost astonished with wonder for at this time when all was quiet else they held conference together and repeated whatever they had heard among the guests by day those two of them that were most notable and masters of this art were scarce ten foot distant from one another the third hung more remote so that i could not so well hear it as i lay abed but it is wonderful to tell how those two provoked each other and by answering invited and drew one another to speak yet did they not confound their words or talk both together but rather utter them alternately and of course besides the daily discourse of the guests they chanted out two stories which generally held them from midnight till morning and that with such modulations and inflections that no man could have taken to come from such little creatures when i asked the host if they had been taught or whether he observed their talking in the night he answered no the same said the whole family but i who could not sleep for nights together was perfectly sensible of their discourse one of their stories was concerning the tapster and his wife who refused to follow him to the wars as he desired her for the husband endeavored to persuade his wife as far as i understood by the birds that he would leave his service in that inn and go to the wars in hopes of plunder but she refused to follow him resolving to stay either at ratisbone or go to nuremberg there was a long and earnest contention between them and all this dialogue the birds repeated they even repeated the unseemly words which were cast out between them and which ought rather to have been suppressed and kept a secret but the birds not knowing the difference between modest immodest honest and filthy words did out with them the other story was concerning the war which the emperor was then threatening against the protestants which the birds probably heard from some of the generals that had conferences in the house these things did they repeat in the night after twelve oclock when there was a deep silence but in the daytime for the most part they were silent and seemed to do nothing but meditate and revolve with themselves upon what the guests conferred together as they sat at table or in their walks i verily had never believed our pliny writing so many wonderful things concerning these little creatures had i not myself seen with my eyes and heard them with my ears uttering such things as i have related neither yet can i of a sudden write all or call to rememberance every particular that i have heard  such is the sagacity ascribed to the nightingale it is but to have high reputation for any one quality and the world is ready enough to give us fame for others to which we have very small pretensions but there is a little bird rather celebrated for its affection to mankind than its singing which however in our climate has the sweetest note of all others the reader already perceives that i mean the redbreast the well known friend of man that is found in every hedge and makes it vocal the note of other birds is louder and their inflections more capricious but this birds voice is soft tender and well supported and the more to be valued as we enjoy it the greatest part of the winter if the nightingales song has been compared to the fiddle the redbreasts voice has all the delicacy of the flute  the redbreast during the spring haunts the wood the grove and the garden it retires to the thickest and shadiest hedgerows to breed in but in winter it seems to become more domestic and often to claim protection from man most of the soft billed birds the nightingale the swallow and the titmouse leave us in the winter when their insect food is no longer offered in plenty but the redbreast continues with us the year round and endeavors to support the famine of winter by chirping round the warm habitations of mankind by coming into those shelters where the rigor of the season is artificially expelled and where insects themselves are found in greater numbers attracted by the same cause  this bird breeds differently in different places in some countries its nest is usually found in the crevice of some mossy bank or at the foot of an hawthorn in hedgerows in others it chooses the thickest coverts and hides its nest with oak leaves the eggs are from four to five of a dull white with reddish streaks  the lark whether the sky lark the wood or the titlark being all distinguishable from other little birds by the length of their heel are louder in their song than either of the former but not so pleasing indeed the music of every bird in captivity produces no very pleasing sensations it is but the mirth of a little animal insensible of its unfortunate situation it is the landscape the grove the golden break of day the contest upon the hawthorn the fluttering from branch to branch the soaring in the air and the answering of its young that gives the birds song its true relish these united improve each other and raise the mind to a state of the highest yet most harmless exultation nothing can in this situation of mind be more pleasing than to see the lark warbling upon the wing raising its note as it soars until it seems lost in the immense heights above us the note continuing the bird itself unseen to see it then descending with a swell as it comes from the clouds yet sinking by degrees as it approaches its nest the spot where all its affections are centered the spot that has prompted all this joy  the lark builds its nest upon the ground beneath some turf that serves to hide and shelter it the female lays four or five eggs of a dusky hue in color somewhat like those of a plover it is while she is sitting that the male thus usually entertains her with his singing and while he is risen to an imperceptible height yet he still has his loved partner in his eye nor once loses sight of the nest either while he ascends or is descending this harmony continues several months beginning early in the spring on pairing in winter they assemble in flocks when their song forsakes them and the birdcatchers destroy them in great numbers for the tables of the luxurious  the blackcap and the wren though so very diminutive are yet prized by some for their singing the former is called by some the mock nightingale and the latter is admired for the loudness of its note compared to the little body from whence it issues it must be confessed that this disproportion between the voice of a bird and its size in some measure demands our wonder quadrupedes in this respect may be considered as mutes to them the peacock is louder than the lion and the rabbit is not so loud as the wren but it must be considered that birds are very differently formed their lungs in some measure are extended through their whole body while in quadrupedes they lie only in the breast in birds there are a variety of cells which take in the air and thus pour forth their contents at the little animals command the blackcap and the wren therefore are as respectable for their voices as they might be deemed inconsiderable for their size  all these soft billed birds thus prized for their singing are rendered domestic and brought up with assiduity by such as are fond of their voices in a cage the same method of treatment serves for all as their food and their habits are nearly the same the manner of taking and treating them particularly the nightingale is this a nightingales nest may be found by observing the place where the male sings and then by sticking two or three mealworms a kind of maggot found in flower on some neighboring thorn which when he sees he will infallibly bear away to his young by listening he then may be heard with the female chirping to the young ones while they are feeding when the nest is found if the young ones are not fledged enough to be taken they must not be touched with the hands for then the old ones will perceive it and entice them away they should not be taken till they are almost as full of feathers as the old ones and though they refuse their meat yet by opening their bills you may give them two or three small bits at a time which will make them soon grow tame when they will feed themselves they should be put nest and all into a little basket which should be covered up warm and they should be fed every two hours their food should be sheeps hearts or other raw flesh meat chopped very fine and all the strings skins and fat taken away but it should always be mixed with hard hens eggs upon which they will feed and thrive abundantly  they should then be put in cages like the nightingales back cage with a little straw or dry moss at the bottom but when they are grown large they should have ants mold they should be kept very clean as indeed should all singingbirds whatsoever for otherwise they will have the cramp and perhaps the claws will drop off in autumn they will sometimes abstain from their food for a fortnight unless two or three mealworms be given them twice or thrice a week or two or three spiders in a day they must likewise have a little saffron in their water figs chopped small among their meat will help them to recover their flesh when their legs are cramped they should be anointed with fresh butter or capons fat three or four days together if they grow melancholy put white sugar candy into their water and feed them with sheepsheart giving them three or four mealworms in a day and a few ants with their eggs they should also have saffron in their water  with regard to adult birds those that are taken before the twentythird of april are accounted the best because after that they begin to pair they usually haunt woods coppices and quickset hedges where they may be taken in trap cages baited with mealworms they should be placed as near the spot where the bird sings as possible and before you fix the trap turn up the earth twice the breadth of the cage because they will there look for food they are also taken with lime twigs placing them upon the hedge where they usually sing and there should be mealworms stuck at proper places to draw them into the snare after they are taken their wings should be gently tied with thread to prevent their beating themselves against the cage this should be first hung in a private place that the bird may not be disturbed and it should be fed every two hours at farthest with sheepsheart and egg minced very fine mixing it with mealworms however the first food must be worms ants caterpillars and flies you must to feed the bird take it in your hand and open the bill with a stick made thick at one end giving it the insects or four or five bits of food as big as peace to entice it to eat its common food should be mixed with ants so that when the bird goes to pick the ants it may pick up some of that also the nightingale when caged begins to sing about the latter end of november and continues its song till june  chap iv of the canarybird and other hard billed singingbirds the canarybird is now become so common and has continued so long in a domestic state that its native habits as well as its native country seem almost forgotten though by the name it appears that these birds came originally from the canary islands yet we have it only from germany where they are bred up in great numbers and sold into different parts of europe at what period they were brought into europe is not well known but it is certain that about a century ago they were sold at very high prices and kept only for the amusement of the great they have since been multiplied in great abundance and their price is diminished in proportion to their plenty  in its native islands a region equally noted for the beauty of its landscapes and the harmony of its groves the canarybird is of a dusky gray color and so different from those usually seen in europe that some have even doubted whether it be of the same species with us they have that variety of coloring usual in all domestic fowls some white some mottled some beautifully shaded with green but they are more esteemed for their note than their beauty having a high piercing pipe as indeed all those of the finch tribe have continuing for some time in one breath without intermission then raising it higher and higher by degrees with great variety  it is this that has rendered the canarybird next to the nightingale the most celebrated songster and as it is more easily reared than any of the soft billed birds and continues its song throughout the year it is rather the most common in our houses rules therefore have been laid down and copious instructions given for breeding these birds in a domestic state which as a part of them may conduce toward the natural history of the bird i will take leave to transcribe  in choosing the canarybird those are best that appear with life and boldness standing upright upon the perch like a sparrowhawk and not apt to be frighted at every thing that stirs if its eyes look cheerful and not drowsy it is a sign of health but on the contrary if it hides its head under the wing and gathers its body up these are symptoms of its being out of order in choosing them the melody of the song should also be minded some will open with the notes of the nightingale and running through a variety of modulations end like the titlark others will begin like the skylark and by a soft melodious turn fall into the notes of the nightingale these are lessons taught this bird in its domestic state and generally taught it by others but its native note is loud shrill piercing and enough to deafen the hearers there are persons who admire each of these songs but the second is in the most general estimation  canarybirds sometimes breed all the year round but they most usually begin to pair in april and to breed in june and august those are said to be the best breeders that are produced between the english and the french  toward the latter end of march a cock and a hen should be put together in a small cage where they will peck at each other in the beginning but will soon become thoroughly reconciled the room where they are kept to breed should be so situated as to let the birds have the benefit of the morning sun and the windows should be of wire not glass that they may enjoy the benefit of the air the floor of the room should be kept clean and sometimes there should be dry gravel or sand sifted upon it there should also be two windows one at each end and several perches at proper distances for the birds to settle on as they fly backwards and forwards a tree in the middle of the room would be the most convenient to divert the birds and sometimes to serve for building their nests upon  in germany they prepare a large room and build it in the manner of a barn being much longer than broad with a square place at each end and several holes to go into those square places in those outlets they plant several sorts of trees in which the birds take great delight to sing and breed the bottom of the place they strew with sand and upon it cast rapeseed chickweed and groundsil which the old birds feed upon while breeding in the body of the house they put all sorts of stuff for building the nest and brooms one under the other in all the corners for the birds to build in these they separate by partitions from each other to prevent those above flying down upon or otherwise incommoding such as breed below the light also is excluded for no bird is fond of having light come to its nest  with us the apparatus for breeding is less expensive a little breedingcage sometimes suffices but seldom any thing more extensive than a small room while the birds are pairing it is usual to feed them with soft meat that is bread mawseed a little scalded rapeseed and near a third part of an egg the room should be furnished with stuff for making their nests such as fine hay wool cotton and hair these materials should be thoroughly dry and then mixed and tied together in such a manner that the birds may readily pull out what they want this should be hung in a proper part of the room and the male will take his turn in building the nest sitting upon the eggs and feeding the young they are generally two or three days in building their nests the hen commonly lays five eggs and in the space of fourteen days the young will be excluded so prolific are these birds sometimes that the female will be ready to hatch a second brood before the first are able to quit the nest on these occasions she leaves the nest and the young to provide herself with another to lay her new brood in in the mean time the male more faithful to the duties of his trust breeds up the young left behind and fits them for a state of independance  when the young ones are excluded the old ones should be supplied with a sufficiency of soft food every day with likewise fresh greens such as cabbage lettuce and chickweed in june shepherds purse and in july and august plantane they are never to have groundsil after the young are excluded with these different delicacies the old ones will take particular care to feed and bring up their young but it is usual when they can feed themselves to be taken from the nest and put into cages their meat then is the yolk of an egg boiled hard with an equal quantity of fine bread and a little scalded rapeseed this must be bruised till it becomes fine and then it may be mixed with a little mawseed after which blend all together which is to be supplied them fresh every day  the canarybird by being kept in company with the linnet or the goldfinch pairs and produces a mixed breed more like the canarybird and resembling it chiefly in its song indeed all this tribe with strong bills and piercing notes and feeding upon grain have the most strong similitude to each other and may justly be supposed as mr buffon imagines to come from the same original they all breed about the same time they frequent the same vegetables they build in the same hedges and trees and are brought up for the cage with the same food and precautions the linnet the bullfinch and the goldfinch when we know the history of the canarybird have scarce any peculiarities that can attract our curiosity or require our care the only art necessary with all those that have no very fine note is to breed them up under some more pleasing harmonist the goldfinch learns a fine song from the nightingale and the linnet and bullfinch may be taught forgetting the wild notes of nature to whistle a long and regular tune  chap v of the swallow and its affinities an idea of any one bird in the former classes will give us some tolerable conception of the rest by knowing the linnet or the canarybird we have some notion of the manners of the goldfinch by exhibiting the history of the nightingale we see also that of the blackcap or the titmouse but the swallow tribe seems to be entirely different from all the former different in their form different in their habits and unlike in all the particulars of their history  in this tribe is to be found the goat sucker which may be styled a nocturnal swallow it is the largest of this kind and is known by its tail which is not forked like that of the common swallow it begins its flight at evening and makes a loud singular noise like the whur of a spinningwheel to this also belongs the houseswallow which is too well known to need a description the martin inferior in size to the former and the tail much less forked it differs also in its nest which is covered at top while that of the houseswallow is open and the swift rather larger than the houseswallow with all the toes standing forward in which it differs from the rest of its kind all these resemble each other so strongly that it is not without difficulty the smaller kinds are known asunder  these are all known by their very large mouths which when they fly are always kept open they are not less remarkable for their short slender feet which scarce are able to support the weight of their bodies their wings are of immoderate extent for their bulk their plumage is glossed with a rich purple and their note is a slight twittering which they seldom exert but upon the wing  this peculiar conformation seems attended with a similar peculiarity of manners their food is insects which they always pursue flying for this reason during fine weather when the insects are most likely to be abroad the swallows are for ever upon the wing and seen pursuing their prey with amazing swiftness and agility all smaller animals in some measure find safety by winding and turning when they endeavor to avoid the greater the lark thus evades the pursuit of the hawk and man the crocodile in this manner insects upon the wing endeavor to avoid the swallow but this bird is admirably fitted by nature to pursue them through their shortest turnings besides a great length of wing it is also provided with a long tail which like a rudder turns it in its most rapid motions and thus while it is possessed of the greatest swiftness it is also possessed of the most extreme agility  early therefore in the spring when the returning sun begins to rouse the insect tribe from their annual state of torpidity when the gnat and the beetle put off their earthly robes and venture into air the swallow then is seen returning from its long migration beyond the ocean and making its way feebly to the shore at first with the timidity of a stranger it appears but seldom and flies but slowly and heavily along as the weather grows warmer and its insect supply increases it then gathers greater strength and activity but it sometimes happens that a rainy season by repelling the insects stints the swallow in its food the poor bird is then seen slowly skimming along the surface of the ground and often resting after a flight of a few minutes in general however it keeps on the wing and moving with a rapidity that nothing can escape when the weather promises to be fair the insect tribe feel the genial influence and make bolder flights at which time the swallow follows them in their aerial journeys and often rises to imperceptible heights in the pursuit when the weather is likely to be foul the insects feel the first notices of it and from the swallows following low we are often apprized of the approaching change  when summer is fairly begun and more than a sufficient supply for sustaining the wants of nature every where offers the swallow then begins to think of forming a progeny the nest is built with great industry and art particularly by the common swallow which builds it on the tops of chimnies the martin sticks it to the eaves of houses the goatsucker as we are told builds it on the bare ground this nest is built with mud from some neighboring brook well tempered with the bill moistened with water for the better adhesion and still farther kept firm by long grass and fibers within it is lined with goose feathers which are ever the warmest and the neatest the martin covers its nest at top and has a door to enter at the swallow leaves here is quite open but our european nests are nothing to be compared with those the swallow builds on the coasts of china and coromandel the description of which i will give in the plain honest phrase of willoughby on the seacoast of the kingdom of china says he a sort of partycolored birds of the shape of swallows at a certain season of the year which is their breedingtime come out of the midland country to the rocks and from the foam or froth of the seawater dashing against the bottom of the rocks gather a certain clammy glutinous matter perchance the spawn of whales or other young fishes of which they build their nests wherein they lay their eggs and hatch their young these nests the chinese pluck from the rocks and bring them in great numbers into the east indies to sell they are esteemed by gluttons as great delicacies who dissolving them in chicken or muttonbroth are very fond of them far before oysters mushrooms or other dainty and lickorish morsels what a pity this luxury has not been introduced among us and then our great feasters might be enabled to eat a little more  the swallow usually lays from five to six eggs of a white color speckled with red and sometimes breeds twice a year when the young brood are excluded the swallow supplies them very plentifully the first brood particularly when she finds herself capable of producing two broods in a year this happens when the parents come early when the season is peculiarly mild and when they begin to pair soon sometimes they find a difficulty in rearing even a single nest particularly when the weather has been severe or their nests have been robbed in the beginning of the season by these accidents this important task is sometimes deferred to the middle of september  at the latter end of september they leave us and for a few days previous to their departure assemble in vast flocks on housetops as if deliberating on the fatiguing journey that lay before them this is no slight undertaking as their flight is directed to congo senegal and along the whole morocco shore there are some however left behind in this general expedition that do not part till eight or ten days after the rest these are chiefly the latter weakly broods which are not yet in a condition to set out they are sometimes even too feeble to venture till the setting in of winter while their parents vainly exhort them to efforts which instinct assures them they are incapable of performing thus it often happens that the wretched little families being compelled to stay perish the first cold weather that comes while the tender parents share the fate of their offspring and die with their newfledged brood  those that migrate are first observed to arrive in africa as mr adanson assures us about the beginning of october they are thought to have performed their fatiguing journey in the space of seven days they are sometimes seen when interrupted by contrary winds wavering in their course far off at sea and lighting upon whatever ship they find in their passage they then seem spent with famine and fatigue yet still they boldly venture when refreshed by a few hours rest to renew their flight and continue the course which they had been steering before  these are facts proved by incontestible authority yet it is a doubt whether all swallows migrate in this manner or whether there may not be some species of this animal that though externally alike are so internally different as to be very differently affected by the approach of winter we are assured from many and these not contemptible witnesses that swallows hide themselves in holes under ground joined close together bill against bill and feet against feet some inform us that they have seen them taken out of the water and even from under the ice in bunches where they are asserted to pass the winter without motion reaumur who particularly interested himself in this enquiry received several accounts of bundles of swallows being thus found in quarries and under the water these men therefore have a right to some degree of assent and are not to lose all credit from our ignorance of what they aver  all however that we have hitherto dissected are formed within like other birds and seem to offer no observable variety indeed that they do not hide themselves under water has been pretty well proved by the noted experiment of frisch who tied several threads died in watercolors round the legs of a great number of swallows that were preparing for their departure these upon their return the ensuing summer brought their threads back with them no way damaged in their color which they most certainly would if during the winter they had been steeped in water yet still this is a subject on which we must suspend our assent as klein the naturalist has brought such a number of proofs in defense of his opinion that swallows are torpid in winter as even the most incredulous must allow to have some degree of probability  chap vi of the hummingbird and its varieties having given some history of the manners of the most remarkable birds of which accounts can be obtained i might now go to a very extensive tribe remarkable for the splendor and the variety of their plumage but the description of the colors of a beautiful bird has nothing in it that can inform or entertain it rather excites a longing which it is impossible for words to satisfy naturalists indeed have endeavored to satisfy this desire by colored prints but beside that these at best give only a faint resemblance of nature and are a very indifferent kind of painting the bird itself has a thousand beauties that the most exquisite artist is incapable of imitating they for instance who imagine they have a complete idea of the beauty of the little tribe of manikin birds from the pictures we have of them will find themselves deceived when they compare their draughts with nature the shining greens the changeable purples and the glossy reds are beyond the reach of the pencil and very far beyond the colored print which is but a poor substitute to painting i have therefore declined entering into a minute description of foreign birds of the sparrow kind as sounds would never convey an adequate idea of colors  there is one species however that i will conclude the history of this class with as though the least it will certainly be allowed the most beautiful of all others in quadrupedes the smallest animals are noxious ugly and loathsome the smallest of birds are the most beautiful innocent and sportive of all those that flutter in the garden or paint the landscape the hummingbird is the most delightful to look upon and the most inoffensive  of this charming little animal there are six or seven varieties from the size of a small wren down to that of an humblebee an european could never have supposed a bird existing so very small and yet completely furnished out with a bill feathers wings and intestines exactly resembling those of the largest kind a bird not so big as the end of ones little finger would probably be supposed but a creature of imagination were it not seen in infinite numbers and as frequent as butterflies in a summers day sporting in the fields of america from flower to flower and extracting their sweets with its little bill  the smallest hummingbird is about the size of an hazelnut the feathers on its wings and tail are black but those on its body and under its wings are of a greenish brown with a fine red cast or gloss which no silk or velvet can imitate it has a small crest on its head green at the bottom and as it were gilded at the top and which sparkles in the sun like a little star in the middle of its forehead the bill is black straight slender and of the length of a small pin the larger hummingbird is near half as big as the common wren and without a crest on its head but to make amends it is covered from the throat half way down the belly with changeable crimson colored feathers that in different lights change to a variety of beautiful colors much like an opal the heads of both are small with very little round eyes as black as jet  it is inconceivable how much these add to the high finishing and beauty of a rich luxurious western landscape as soon as the sun is risen the hummingbirds of different kinds are seen fluttering about the flowers without ever lighting upon them their wings are in such rapid motion that it is impossible to discern their colors except by their glittering they are never still but continually in motion visiting flower after flower and extracting its honey as if with a kiss for this purpose they are furnished with a forky tongue that enters the cup of the flower and extracts its nectared tribute upon this alone they subsist the rapid motion of their wings brings out an humming sound from whence they have their name for whatever divides the air swiftly must thus produce a murmur  the nests of these birds are not less curious than the rest they are suspended in the air at the point of the twigs of an orange a pomegranate or a citrontree sometimes even in houses if they find a small and convenient twig for the purpose the female is the architect while the male goes in quest of materials such as cotton fine moss and the fibers of vegetables of these materials a nest is composed of about the size of an hens egg cut in two admirably contrived and warmly lined with cotton they lay two eggs at a time and never more about the size of small peace and as white as snow with here and there a yellow speck the male and the female sit upon the nest by turns but the female takes to herself the greatest share she seldom quits the nest except a few minutes in the morning and evening when the dew is upon the flowers and their honey in perfection during this short interval the male takes her place for as the egg is so small the exposing it ever so short a time to the weather would be apt to injure its contents the surface exposed being so great in comparison to the bulk the time of incubation continues twelve days at the end of which the young ones appear much about the size of a bluebottle fly they are at first bare by degrees they are covered with down and at last feathers succeed but less beautiful at first than those of the old ones  father labats companion in the mission to america found the nest of an hummingbird in a shed that was near the dwelling house and took it in at a time when the young ones were about fifteen or twenty days old he then placed them in a cage at his chamber window to be amused by their sportive flutterings but he was soon surprised to see the old ones that came and fed their brood regularly every hour in the day by these means they themselves soon grew so tame that they seldom quitted the chamber but without any constraint came to live with their young ones all four have frequently come to perch upon their masters hand chirruping as if they had been at liberty abroad he fed them with a very fine clear paste made of wine biscuit and sugar they thrust their tongues into this paste till they were satisfied and then fluttered and chirruped about the room i never beheld any thing more agreeable continues he than this lovely little family that had taken possession of my companions chamber and that flew out and in just as they thought proper but were ever attentive to the voice of their master when he called them in this manner they lived with him for above six months but at a time when he expected to see a new colony formed he unfortunately forgot to tie up their cage to the cieling at night to preserve them from the rats and he found they were devoured in the morning  these birds on the continent of america continue to flutter the year round as their food which is the honey of flowers never forsakes them in those warm latitudes where they are found but it is otherwise in the islands of the antilles where when the winter season approaches they retire and as some say continue in a torpid state during the severity of that season at surinam and jamaica where they constantly have flowers these beautiful birds are never known to disappear  it is a doubt whether or not these birds have a continued note in singing all travelers agree that beside the humming noise produced by their wings they have a little interrupted chirrup but labat asserts that they have a most pleasing melancholy melody in their voices though small and proportioned to the organs which produce it it is very probable that in different places their notes are also different and as there are some that continue torpid all the winter there may likewise be some with agreeable voices though the rest may in general be silent  the indians formerly made great use of this pretty birds plumage in adorning their belts and headdress the children take them in the fields upon rings smeared with birdlime they approach the place where the birds are flying and twirling their rings in the air so allure them either by the color or the sound that the simple little creature comes to rest upon the ring and is seized they are then instantly killed and gutted and hung up in the chimney to dry those who take greater care dry them in a stove which is not so likely to injure the plumage as the foregoing method their beautiful feathers were once the ornament of the highest rank of savage nobility but at present they take the bird rather for the purpose of selling it as a curiosity to the europeans than that of ornament for themselves all the taste for savage finery is wearing out fast even among the americans they now begin to adopt if not the dresses of europe at least the materials of which they are composed the wandering warrior is far from thinking himself fine at present with his bow and his feathered crown his ambition reaches to higher ornaments a gun a blue shirt and a blanket  part v of birds of the crane kind chap i of birds of the crane kind in general the progressions of nature from one class of beings to another are always by slow and almost imperceptible degrees she has peopled the woods and the fields with a variety of the most beautiful birds and to leave no part of her extensive territories untenanted she has stocked the waters with its feathered inhabitants also she has taken the same care in providing for the wants of her animals in this element as she has done with respect to those of the other she has used as much precaution to render waterfowl fit for swimming as she did in forming landfowl for flight she has defended their feathers with a natural oil and united their toes by a webbed membrane by which contrivances they have at once security and motion but between the classes of landbirds that shun the water and of waterfowl that are made for swimming and living on it she has formed a very numerous tribe of birds that seem to partake of a middle nature that with divided toes seemingly fitted to live upon land are at the same time furnished with appetites that chiefly attach them to the waters these can properly be called neither landbirds nor waterfowl as they provide all their sustenance from watery places and yet are unqualified to seek it in those depths where it is often found in greatest plenty  this class of birds of the crane kind are to be distinguished from others rather by their appetites than their conformation yet even in this respect they seem to be sufficiently discriminated by nature as they are to live among the waters yet are incapable of swimming in them most of them have long legs fitted for wading in shallow waters or long bills proper for groping in them  every bird of this kind habituated to marshy places may be known if not by the length of its legs at least by the scaly surface of them those who have observed the legs of a snipe or a woodcock will easily perceive my meaning and how different the surface of the skin that covers them is from that of the pigeon or the partridge most birds of this kind also are bare of feathers half way up the thigh at least in all of them above the knee their long habits of wading in the waters and having their legs continually in moisture prevents the growth of feathers on those parts so that there is a surprising difference between the leg of a crane naked of feathers almost up to the body and the falcon booted almost to the very toes  the bill also is very distinguishable in most of this class it is in general longer than that of other birds and in some finely fluted on every side while at the point it is possessed of extreme sensibility and furnished with nerves for the better feeling their food at the bottom of marshes where it cannot be seen some birds of this class are thus fitted with every convenience they have long legs for wading long necks for stooping long bills for searching and nervous points for feeling others are not so amply provided for as some have long bills but legs of no great length and others have long necks but very short legs it is a rule which universally holds that where the birds legs are long the neck is also long in proportion it would indeed be an incurable defect in the birds conformation to be lifted upon stilts above its food without being furnished with an instrument to reach it  if we consider the natural power of this class in a comparative view they will seem rather inferior to those of every other tribe their nests are more simple than those of the sparrow and their methods of obtaining food less ingenious than those of the falcon the pie exceeds them in cunning and though they have all the voraciousness of the poultry tribe they want their fecundity none of this kind therefore have been taken into mans society or under his protection they are neither caged like the nightingale nor kept tame like the turkey but lead a life of precarious liberty in fens and marshes at the edges of lakes and along the seashore they all live upon fish or insects one or two only excepted even those that are called mudsuckers such as the snipe and the woodcock it is more than probable grope the bottom of marshy places only for such insects as are deposited there by their kind and live in a vermicular state in pools and plashes till they take wing and become flying insects  all this class therefore that are fed upon insects their food being easily digestible are good to be eaten while those who live entirely upon fish abounding in oil acquire in their flesh the rancidity of their diet and are in general unfit for our tables to savages indeed and sailors on a long voyage every thing that has life seems good to be eaten and we often find them recommending those animals as dainties which they themselves would spurn at after a course of good living nothing is more common in their journals than such accounts as these  this day we shot a fox  pretty good eating this day we shot a heron  pretty good eating and this day we killed a turtle  which they rank with the heron and the fox as pretty good eating their accounts therefore of the flesh of these birds are not to be depended upon and when they cry up the heron or the stork of other countries as luxurious food we must always attend to the state of their appetites who give the character  in treating of this class of birds it will be best to observe the simplest method possible neither to load the memory with numerous distinctions nor yet confuse the imagination by a total want of arrangement i will therefore describe some of the larger sorts separately as in an history of birds each of these demands peculiar distinction the crane the stork the ballearic crane the heron the bittern with some others may require a separate history some particular tribes may next offer that may very naturally be classed together and as for all the smaller and least remarkable sorts they may be grouped into one general description  chap ii the crane there is something extraordinary in the different accounts we have of this birds size and dimensions willoughby and penant make the crane from five to six feet long from the tip to the tail other accounts say that it is above five feet high and others that it is as tall as a man from the many which i myself had seen i own this imputed magnitude surprised me as from memory i was convinced they could neither be so long nor so tall indeed a bird the body of which is not larger than that of a turkeyhen and acknowledged on all hands not to weigh above ten pounds cannot easily be supposed to be almost as long as an ostrich brisson however seems to give this bird its real dimensions when he describes it as something less than the brown stork about three feet high and about four from the tip to the tail still however the numerous testimonies of its superior size are not to be totally rejected and perhaps that from which brisson took his dimensions was one of the smallest of the kind  the crane taking its dimensions from him is exactly three feet four inches from the tip to the tail and four feet from the head to the toe it is a tall slender bird with a long neck and long legs the top of the head is covered with black bristles and the back of it is bald and red which sufficiently distinguishes this bird from the stork to which it is very nearly allied in size and figure the plumage in general is ashcolored and there are two large tufts of feathers that spring from the pinion of each wing these bear a resemblance to hair and are finely curled at the ends which the bird has a power of erecting and depressing at pleasure gesner says that these feathers in his time used to be set in gold and worn as ornaments in caps  such are the dimensions of a bird concerning which not to mention modern times there have been more fables propagated than of any other it is a bird with which all the ancient writers are familiar and in describing it they have not failed to mix imagination with history from the policy of the cranes they say we are to look for an idea of the most perfect republic amongst ourselves from their tenderness to their decrepid parents which they take care to nourish to cherish and support when flying we are to learn lessons of filial piety but particularly from their conduct in fighting with the pigmies of ethiopia we are to receive our maxims in the art of war in early times the history of nature fell to the lot of poets only and certainly none could describe it so well but it is a part of their province to embellish also and when this agreeable science was claimed by a more sober class of people they were obliged to take the accounts of things as they found them and in the present instance fable ran down blended with truth to posterity  in these accounts therefore there is some foundation of truth yet much more has been added by fancy the crane is certainly a very social bird and they are seldom seen alone their usual method of flying or sitting is in flocks of fifty or sixty together and while a part feed the rest stand like sentinels upon duty the fable of their supporting their aged parents may have arisen from their strict connubial affection and as for their fighting with the pigmies it may not be improbable but that they have boldly withstood the invasions of monkies coming to rob their nests for in this case as the crane lives upon vegetables it is not probable that it would be the first aggressor  however this be the crane is a wandering sociable bird that for the most part subsists upon vegetables and is known in every country of europe except our own there is no part of the world says belonius where the fields are cultivated that the crane does not come in with the husbandman for a share in the harvest as they are birds of passage they are seen to depart and return regularly at those seasons when their provision invites or repels them they generally leave europe about the latter end of autumn and return in the beginning of summer in the inland parts of the continent they are seen crossing the country in flocks of fifty or an hundred making from the northern regions toward the south in these migrations however they are not so resolutely bent upon going forward but that if a field of corn offers in their way they will stop a while to regale upon it on such occasions they do incredible damage chiefly in the night and the husbandman who lay down in joyful expectation rises in the morning to see his fields laid entirely waste by an enemy whose march is too swift for his vengeance to overtake  our own country is free from their visits not but that they were formerly known in this island and held in great estimation for the delicacy of their flesh there was even a penalty upon such as destroyed their eggs but at present they never go so far out of their way cultivation and populousness go hand in hand and though our fields may offer them a greater plenty yet it is so guarded that the birds find the venture greater than the enjoyment and probably we are much better off by their absence than their company whatever their flesh might once have been when as plutarch tells us cranes were blinded and kept in coops to be fattened for the tables of the great in rome or as they were brought up stuffed with mint and rue to the tables of our nobles at home at present they are considered all over europe as wretched eating the flesh is fibrous and dry requiring much preparation to make it palatable and even after every art it is fit only for the stomachs of strong and laboring people  the cold artic region seems to be this birds favorite abode they come down into the more southern parts of europe rather as visitants than inhabitants yet it is not well known in what manner they portion out their time to the different parts of the world the migrations of the fieldfare or thrush are obvious and well known they go northward or southward in one simple track when their food fails them here they have but one region to go to but it is otherwise with the crane he changes place like a wanderer he spends the autumn in europe he then flies off probably to some more southern climate to enjoy a part of the winter returns to europe in the spring crosses up to the north in summer visits those lakes that are never dry and then comes down again to make depredations upon our cultivated grounds in autumn thus gesner assures us that the cranes usually began to quit germany from about the eleventh of september to the seventeenth of october from thence they were seen flying southward by thousands and redi tells us they arrive in tuscany a short time after there they tear up the fields newly sown for the grain just committed to the ground and do great mischief it is to be supposed that in the severity of winter they go southward still nearer the line they again appear in the fields of pisa regularly about the twentieth of february to anticipate the spring  in these journeys it is amazing to conceive the heights to which they ascend when they fly their note is the loudest of all other birds and that is often heard in the clouds when the bird itself is entirely unseen as it is light for its size and spreads a large expanse of wing it is capable of floating at the greatest height where the air is lightest and as it secures its safety and is entirely out of the reach of man it flies in tracts which would be too fatiguing for any other birds to move forward in  in these aerial journeys though unseen themselves they have the distinctest vision of every object below they govern and direct their flight by their cries and exhort each other to proceed or to descend when a fit opportunity offers for depredation their voice as was observed is the loudest of all the feathered tribe and its peculiar clangor arises from the very extraordinary length and contortion of the windpipe in quadrupedes the windpipe is short and the glottis or cartilages that form the voice are at that end of it which is next the mouth in water fowl the windpipe is longer but the cartilages that form the voice are at the other end which lies down in their belly by this means they have much louder voices in proportion to their size than any other animals whatever for the note when formed below is reverberated through all the rings of the windpipe till it reaches the air but the voice of the duck or the goose is nothing to be compared to that of the crane whose windpipe is not only made in the same manner with theirs but is above twenty times as long nature seems to have bestowed much pains in lengthening out this organ from the outside it enters through the flesh into the breast bone which has a great cavity within to receive it there being thrice reflected it goes out again at the same hole and so turns down to the lungs and thus enters the body a second time the loud clangorous sound which the bird is thus enabled to produce is when near almost deafening however it is particularly serviceable to the animal itself either during its migrations or its stay by it the flock is encouraged in their journies and if while they are feeding which is usually performed in profound silence they are invaded on any side the bird that first perceives the danger is sure to sound the alarm and all are speedily upon the wing  as they rise but heavily they are very shy birds and seldom let the fowler approach them their depredations are usually made in the darkest nights at which time they enter a field of corn and trample it down as if it had been crossed over by a regiment of men on other occasions they choose some extensive solitary marsh where they range themselves all day as if they were in deliberation and not having that grain which is most to their appetites wade the marshes for insects and other food which they can procure with less danger  corn is their favorite food but there is scarce any other that comes amiss to them redi who opened several found the stomach of one full of the herb called dandelion that of another was filled with beans a third had a great quantity of clover in its stomach while that of two others was filled with earthworms and beetles in some he found lizards and seafish in others snails grass and pebbles swallowed perhaps for medicinal purposes it seems therefore that these birds are easily supplied and that they are noxious to cornfieldsd but on some particular occasions  in general it is a peaceful bird both in its own society and with respect to those of the forest though so large in appearance a little falcon pursues and often disables it the method is with those who are fond of hawking to fly several hawks together against it which the crane endeavors to avoid by flying up perpendicularly till the air becomes too thin to support it any higher the hawk however still bears it company and though less fitted for floating in so thin a medium yet possessed of greater rapidity it still gains the ascendency they both often rise out of sight but soon the spectator who keeps his eye fixed above perceives them like two specks beginning to appear they gather on his eye for a little space and shortly after come tumbling perpendicularly together with great animosity on the side of the hawk and a loud screaming on that of the crane thus driven to extremity and unable to fly the poor animal throws itself upon its back and in that situation makes a most desperate defense till the sportsman coming up generally puts an end to the contest with its life  it was once the barbarous custom to breed up cranes to be thus baited and young ones were taken from the nest to be trained up for this cruel diversion it is an animal easily tamed and if we can believe albertus magnus has a particular affection for man this quality however was not sufficient to guard it from being made the victim of his fierce amusements the female which is easily distinguished from the male by not being bald behind as he is never lays above two eggs at a time being like those of a goose but of a bluish color the young ones are soon fit to fly and then the parents forsake them to shift for themselves but before this time they are led forth to the places where their food is most easily found though yet unfledged they run with such swiftness that a man cannot easily overtake them we are told that as they grow old their plumage becomes darker and as a proof of their longevity aldrovandus assures us that a friend of his kept one tame for above forty years  whatever may have been the disposition of the great the vulgar of every country to this day bear the crane a compassionate regard it is possible the ancient prejudices in its favor which once having been planted are eradicated but slowly may still continue to operate in some countries it is considered as an heinous offense to kill a crane and though the legislature declines to punish yet the people do not fail to resent the injury the crane they in some measure consider as the prophet of the season upon its approach or delay they regulate the periods of their rural economy if their favorite bird comes early in the season they expect a plentiful summer if he is slow in his visits they then prepare for an unfavourable spring whatever wisdom there may be in despising the prejudices of the vulgar there is but little in condemning them they have generally had their origin in good motives and it should never be our endeavors to suppress any tender emotions of friendship or pity in those hard breasts that are in general unsusceptible of either  chap iii the stork if we regard the stork externally only we shall be very apt to confound it with the crane it is of the same size it has the same formation as to the bill neck legs and body except that it is something more corpulent its differences are but very slight such as the color which in the crane is ash and black but in the stork is white and brown the nails of the toes of the stork also are very peculiar not being clawed like those of other birds but flat like the nails of a man  these however are but very slight differences and its true distinctions are to be taken rather from its manners than its form the crane has a loud piercing voice the stork is silent and produces no other noise than the clacking of its under chap against the upper the crane has a strange convolution of the windpipe through the breast bone the storks is formed in the usual manner the crane feeds mostly upon vegetables and grain the stork preys entirely upon frogs fishes birds and serpents the crane avoids towns and populous places the stork lives always in or near them the crane lays but two eggs and the stork generally four these are distinctions fully sufficient to mark the species notwithstanding the similitude of their form  storks are birds of passage like the former but it is hard to say whence they come or whither they go when they withdraw from europe they all assemble on a particular day and never leave one of their company behind them they take their flight in the night which is the reason the way they go has never been observed they generally return into europe in the middle of march and make their nests on the tops of chimnies and houses as well as of high trees the females lay from two to four eggs of the size and color of those of geese and the male and female sit upon them by turns they are a month in hatching and when their young are excluded they are particularly solicitous for their safety  as the food of these birds consists in a great measure of frogs and serpents it is not to be wondered at that different nations have paid them a particular veneration the dutch are very solicitous for the preservation of the stork in every part of their republic this bird seems to have taken refuge among their towns and builds on the tops of their houses without any molestation there it is seen resting familiarly in their streets and protected as well by the laws as the prejudices of the people they have even got an opinion that it will only live in a republic and that story of its filial piety first falsely propagated of the crane has in part been ascribed to the stork but it is not in republics alone that the stork is seen to reside as there are few towns on the continent in low marshy situations but have the stork as an inmate among them as well the despotic princes of germany as the little republics of italy  the stork seems a general favorite even among the moderns but with the ancient egyptians their regard was carried even to adoration this enlightened people who worshipped the deity in his creatures paid divine honors to the ibis as is universally known it has been usually supposed that the ancient ibis is the same with that which goes at present by the same name a bird of the stork kind of about the size of a curlew all over black with a bill very thick in the beginning but ending in a point for the better seizing its prey which is caterpillars locusts and serpents but however useful the modern ibis may be in ridding egypt where it resides of the vermin and venomous animals that infest it yet it is much doubted whether this be the same ibis to which the ancients paid their adoration maillet the french consul at cairo observes that it is very hard to determine what bird the ancient ibis certainly was because there are cranes storks hawks kites and falcons that are all equally enemies to serpents and devour a vast number he farther adds that in the months of may when the winds begin to blow from the internal parts of africa there are several sorts of birds that come down from upper egypt from whence they are driven by the rains in search of a better habitation and that it is then they do this country such signal services nor does the figure of this bird hierogliphically represented on their pillars mark it sufficiently to make the distinction besides the modern ibis is not peculiar to egypt as it is to be seen but at certain seasons of the year whereas we are informed by pliny that this bird was seen no where else it is thought therefore that the true ibis is a bird of the vulture kind described above and called by some the capon of pharaoh which not only is a devourer of serpents but will follow the caravans that go to mecca to feed upon the offal of the animals that are killed on the journey  chap iv of the balearic and other foreign cranes having ended the last chapter with doubts concerning the ibis we shall begin this with doubts concerning the balearic crane pliny has described a bird of the cranekind with a topping resembling that of the green woodpecker this bird for a long time continued unknown till we became acquainted with the birds of tropical climates when one of the cranekind with a topping was brought into europe and described by aldrovandus as plinys balearic crane hence these birds which have since been brought from africa and the east in numbers have received the name of balearic cranes but without any just foundation the real balearic crane of pliny seems to be the lesser ashcolored heron with a topping of narrow white feathers or perhaps the egret with two long feathers that fall back from the sides of the head the bird that we are about to describe under the name of the balearic crane was unknown to the ancients and the heron or egret ought to be reinstated in their just title to that name  depiction of the balearic crane black crowned crane and the white stork   balearic crane   white stork  de seve del isc tailor sculp   when we see a very extraordinary animal we are naturally led to suppose that there must be something also remarkable in its history to correspond with the singularity of its figure but it often happens that history fails on those occasions where we most desire information in the present instance in particular no bird presents to the eye a more whimsical figure than this which we must be content to call the balearic crane it is pretty nearly of the shape and size of the ordinary crane with long legs and a long neck like others of the kind but the bill is shorter and the color of the feathers of a dark greenish gray the head and throat form the most striking part of this birds figure on the head is seen standing up a thick round crest made of bristles spreading every way and resembling rays standing out in different directions the longest of these rays are about three inches and an half and they are all topped with a kind of black tassels which give them a beautiful appearance the sides of the head and cheeks are bare whitish and edged with red while underneath the throat hangs a kind of bag or wattle like that of a cock but not divided into two to give this odd composition a higher finishing the eye is large and staring the pupil black and big surrounded with a goldcoloured iris that completes the birds very singular appearance  from such a peculiar figure we might be led to wish for a minute history of its manners but of these we can give but slight information this bird comes from the coast of africa and the cape de verd islands as it runs it stretches out its wings and goes very swiftly otherwise its usual motion is very slow in their domestic state they walk very deliberately among other poultry and suffer themselves to be approached at least it was so with that i saw by every spectator they never roost in houses but about night when they are disposed to go to rest they search out some high wall on which they perch in the manner of a peacock indeed they so much resemble that bird in manners and disposition that some have described them by the name of the seapeacock and ray has been inclined to rank them in the same family but though their voice and roosting be similar their food which is entirely upon greens vegetables and barley seems to make some difference  in this chapter of foreign birds of the cranekind it will be proper to mention the jabiru and the jabiru guacu both natives of brasil of these great birds of the cranekind we know but little except the general outline of their figure and the enormous bills which we often see preserved in the cabinets of the curious the bill of the latter is red and thirteen inches long the bill of the former is black and is found to be eleven neither of them however are of a size proportioned to their immoderate length of bill the jabiru guacu is not above the size of a common stork while the jabiru with the smallest bill exceeds the size of a swan they are both covered with white feathers except the head and neck that are naked and their principal difference is in the size of the body and the make of the bill the lower chap of the jabiru guacu being broad and bending upwards  a bird still more extraordinary may be added to this class called the anhima and like the the two former a native of brasil this is a waterfowl of the rapacious kind and bigger than a swan the head which is small for the size of the body bears a black bill which is not above two inches long but what distinguishes it in particular is a horn growing from the forehead as long as the bill and bending forward like that of the fabulous unicorn of the ancients this horn is not much thicker than a crowquill as round as if it were turned in a lathe and of an ivory color but this is not the only instrument of battle this formidable bird carries it seems to be armed at all points for at the forepart of each wing at the second joint spring two straight triangular spurs about as thick as ones little finger the foremost of these goads or spurs is above an inch long the hinder is shorter and both of a dusky color the claws also are long and sharp the color is black and white and they cry terribly loud sounding something like vyhoo vyhoo they are never found alone but always in pairs the cock and hen prowl together and their fidelity is said to be such that when one dies the other never departs from the carcass but dies with its companion it makes its nest of clay near the bodies of trees upon the ground of the shape of an oven  one bird more may be subjoined to this class not for the oddity of its figure but the peculiarity of its manners it is vulgarly called by our sailors the buffoon bird and by the french the demoiselle or lady the same qualities have procured it these different appellations from two nations who on more occasions than this look upon the same objects in very different lights the peculiar gestures and contortions of this bird the proper name of which is the numidian crane are extremely singular and the french who are skilled in the arts of elegant gesticulation consider all its motions as ladylike and graceful our english sailors however who have not entered so deeply into the dancing art think that while thus in motion the bird cuts but a very ridiculous figure it stoops rises lifts one wing then another turns round sails forward then back again all which highly diverts our seamen not imagining perhaps that all these contortions are but the awkward expression not of the poor animals pleasures but its fears  it is a very scarce bird the plumage is of a leaden gray but it is distinguished by fine white feathers consisting of long fibers which fall from the back of the head about four inches long while the forepart of the neck is adorned with black feathers composed of very fine soft and long fibers that hang down upon the stomach and give the bird a very graceful appearance the ancients have described a buffoon bird but there are many reasons to believe that theirs is not the numidian crane it comes from that country from whence it has taken its name  chap v of the heron and its varieties birds of the crane the stork and the heron kind bear a very strong affinity to each other and their differences are not easily discernible as for the crane and the stork they differ rather in their nature and internal conformation than in their external figure but still they may be known asunder as well by their color as by the storks claws which are very peculiar and more resembling a mans nails than the claws of a bird the heron may be distinguished from both as well by its size which is much less as by its bill which in proportion is much longer but particularly by the middle claw on each foot which is toothed like a saw for the better seizing and holding its slippery prey should other marks fail however there is an anatomical distinction in which herons differ from all other birds which is that they have but one coecum and all other birds have two  of this tribe brison has enumerated not less than fortyseven sorts all differing in their size figure and plumage and with talents adapted to their place of residence or their peculiar pursuits but how various soever the heron kind may be in their colors or their bills they all seem possessed of the same manners and have but one character of cowardice and rapacity indolence yet insatiable hunger other birds are found to grow fat by an abundant supply of food but these though excessively destructive and voracious are ever found to have lean and carrion bodies as if not even plenty were sufficient for their support  the common heron is remarkably light in proportion to its bulk scarce weighing three pounds and an half yet it expands a breadth of wing which is five feet from tip to tip its bill is very long being five inches from the point to the base its claws are long sharp and the middlemost toothed like a saw yet thus armed as it appears for war it is indolent and cowardly and even flies at the approach of a sparrowhawk it was once the amusement of the great to pursue this timorous creature with the falcon and heronhawking was so favorite a diversion among our ancestors that laws were enacted for the preservation of the species and the person who destroyed their eggs was liable to a penalty of twenty shillings for each offense  at present however the defects of the illjudged policy of our ancestors is felt by their posterity for as the amusement of hawking has given place to the more useful method of stocking fish ponds the heron is now become a most formidable enemy of all other birds this commits the greatest devastation in freshwaters and there is scarce a fish though never so large that he will not strike at and wound though unable to carry it away but the smaller fry are his chief subsistence these pursued by their larger fellows of the deep are obliged to take refuge in shallow waters where they find the heron a still more formidable enemy his method is to wade as far as he can go into the water and there patiently wait the approach of his prey which when it comes within sight he darts upon it with inevitable aim in this manner he is found to destroy more in a week than an otter in three months i have seen an heron says willoughby that had been shot that had seventeen carps in his belly at once which he will digest in six or seven hours and then to fishing again i have seen a carp continues he taken out of a herons belly nine inches and an half long several gentlemen who kept tame herons to try what quantity one of them would eat in a day have put several smaller roach and dace in a tub and they have found him eat fifty in a day one day with another in this manner a single heron will destroy fifteen thousand carp in a single half year  so great are the digestive powers of this fresh water tyrant and so detrimental to those who stock ponds with fish in general he is seen taking his gloomy stand by the lake side as if meditating mischief motionless and gorged with plunder his usual attitude on this occasion is to sink his long neck between his shoulders and keep his head turned on one side as if eyeing the pool more intently when the call of hunger returns the toil of an hour or two is generally sufficient to fill his capacious stomach and he retires long before night to his retreat in the woods early in the morning however he is seen assiduous at his usual occupation  but though in seasons of fine weather the heron can always find a plentiful supply in cold or stormy seasons his prey is no longer within reach the fish that before came into the shallow water now keep in the deep as they find it to be the warmest situation frogs and lizards also seldom venture from their lurking places and the heron is obliged to support himself upon his long habits of patience and even to take up with the weeds that grow upon the water at those times he contracts a consumptive disposition which succeeding plenty is not able to remove so that the meagre glutton spends his time between want and riot and feels alternately the extremes of famine and excess hence notwithstanding the care with which he takes his prey and the amazing quantity he devours the heron is always lean and emaciated and though his crop be usually found full yet his flesh is scarce sufficient to cover the bones  the heron usually takes his prey by wading into the water yet it must not be supposed that he does not also take it upon the wing in fact much of his fishing is performed in this manner but he never hovers over deep waters as there his prey is enabled to escape him by sinking to the bottom in shallow places he darts with more certainty for though the fish at sight of its enemy instantly descends yet the heron with his long bill and legs instantly pins it to the bottom and thus seizes it securely in this manner after having been seen with its long neck for above a minute under water he rises upon the wing with a trout or an eel struggling in his bill to get free the greedy bird however flies to the shore scarce gives it time to expire but swallows it whole and then returns to fishing as before  as this bird does incredible mischief to ponds newly stocked willoughby has given a receipt for taking him having found his haunt get three or four small roach or dace and having provided a strong hook with a wire to it this is drawn just within side the skin of the fish beginning without side the gills and running it to the tail by which the fish will not be killed but continue for five or six days alive then having a strong line made of silk and wire about two yards and an half long it is tied to a stone at one end the fish with the hook being suffered to swim about at the other this being properly disposed in shallow water the heron will seize upon the fish to its own destruction from this method we may learn that the fish must be alive otherwise the heron will not touch them and that this bird as well as all those that feed upon fish must be its own caterer for they will not prey upon such as die naturally or are killed by others before them  though this bird lives chiefly among pools and marshes yet its nest is built on the tops of the highest trees and sometimes on cliffs hanging over the sea they are never in flocks when they fish committing their depredations in solitude and silence but in making their nests they love each others society and they are seen like rooks building in company with flocks of their kind their nests are made of sticks and lined with wool and the female lays four large eggs of a pale green color the observable indolence of their nature however is not less seen in their nestling than in their habits of depredation nothing is more certain and i have seen it an hundred times than that they will not be at the trouble of building a nest when they can get one made by the rook or deserted by the owl already provided for them this they usually enlarge and line within driving off the original possessors should they happen to renew their fruitless claims  the french seem to have availed themselves of the indolence of this bird in making its nest and they actually provide a place with materials fitted for their nestling which they call heronries the heron which with us is totally unfit for the table is more sought for in france where the flesh of the young ones is in particular estimation to obtain this the natives raise up high sheds along some fishy stream and furnishing them with materials for the herons to nestle with these birds build and breed there in great abundance as soon as the young ones are supposed to be fit the owner of the heronry comes as we do into a pigeonhouse and carries off such as are proper for eating and these are sold for a very good price to the neighboring gentry these are a delicacy which as my author says the french are very fond of but which strangers have not yet been taught to relish as they ought nevertheless it was formerly much esteemed as a food in england and made a favorite dish at great tables it was then said that the flesh of a heron was a dish for a king at present nothing about the house will touch it but a cat  with us therefore as the heron both old and young is thought detestable eating we seldom trouble these animals in their heights which are for the most part sufficiently inaccessible their nests are often found in great numbers in the middle of large forests and in some groves nearer home where the owners have a predilection for the bird and do not choose to drive it from its accustomed habitations it is certain that by their cries their expansive wings their bulk and wavy motion they add no small solemnity to the forest and give a pleasing variety to a finished improvement  when the young are excluded as they are numerous voracious and importunate the old ones are for ever upon the wing to provide them with abundance the quantity of fish they take upon this occasion is amazing and their size is not less to be wondered at i remember a herons nest that was built near a schoolhouse the boys with their usual appetite for mischief climbed up took down the young ones sewed up the vent and laid them in the nest as before the pain the poor little animals felt from the operation increased their cries and this but served to increase the diligence of the old ones in enlarging their supply thus they heaped the nest with various sorts of fish and the best of their kind and as their young screamed they flew off for more the boys gathered up the fish which the young ones were incapable of eating till the old ones at last quitted their nest and gave up their brood whose appetites they found it impossible to satisfy  the heron is said to be a very longlived bird by mr keyslers account it may exceed sixty years and by a recent instance of one that was taken in holland by an hawk belonging to the stadtholder its longevity is again confirmed the bird having a silver plate fastened to one leg with an inscription importing that it had been struck by the elector of colognes hawks thirtyfive years before  end of the fifth volume
