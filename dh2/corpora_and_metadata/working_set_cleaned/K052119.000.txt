bravely sir thank your axing   del the sight of my dear woodville in good health gives me infinite pleasure i am well you see but my heart ah woodville not all the sparkling beauties of the louvre have had power to efface my charming emilys dear dear idea but how does the lovely girl  say is she in town that i may fly  ha what   y wood i am extremely sorry that i am obliged like your evil genius to meet you with ill news on your arrival but all the consolation i can afford my dear friend is an assurance of my sisters constancy  to keep you no longer in suspense  my father has promised her hand to sir geofry ginkle    del cursed infernal avarice what motive else could have induced the hitherto kindest parent to make a sacrifice of his darling his blooming emily to such an old  by heaven i will go this instant and    tha arrah sir sir your putting yourself into passions and flurries is mighty silly  might silly upon my soul  couggar  i will be bound to put you in a way that you may have your own game with him i will tell you do you see i will watch this mr gingle if it is gingle you call him and manumshandoul if i dont put the speak out of him  and then when the old divil is quiet in his grave you may cuckold him as fast as you please eh sir turning to woodville would not there be some fun in that all this while delamour walks about in great disorder   y wood what thady sure you would not commit murder   tha murder arrah fat murder an old son of a whore that has one leg already in the grave and if i trip the other after it is that murder oh the devil a murder in that sure   y wood come come delamour dont be so uneasy your case is not desperate the indissoluble knot is yet to be tied   del happy woodville happy in being conscious you possess my sisters heart unrivaled free from the harsh injunctions of an obdurate parent to thwart your loves  but i    y wood ah delamour i am no object to be envied and far from having an assurance of florimels affections happy then indeed should i be but she is still the same gay unthinking lovely witty rogue if in the most unfeigned rapture i breathe my love the return is a loud laugh an opera tune or a ridiculous simile which faith sometimes makes me look very silly indeed in her more serious moments which are but few she perhaps gives me an hearing when all at once a crowd of gayer thoughts rush on and kill at once the hopes wherewith i was elated a few minutes before   del you shall find me a powerful advocate in your cause but excuse me for deviating from the maxims of our modern professors of the law my proceedings in your favor will not be wholly disinterested you must give me all the assistance in your power to break the measures of your father and sir geofry but how such a notion entered into his doting brain is to me amazing i have often heard him express the utmost abhorrence to matrimony but then when i reflect upon my emilys beauty i cannot wonder at his being caught old goat    y wood love is far from being the sole motive of sir geofrys addresses to emily the vain hopes of having an heir of his own begetting to inherit his estate which you know is considerable and to mortify his nephew these are the spurs which prick him on in the road which has hitherto appeared so dreadful to him i dare say you know this nephew as sir geofry had no children of his own and intended never to marry he bred him up under his own care placed his chief felicity in having him receive those accomplishments proper for a person who as he was to inherit sir geofrys estate after his decease probably might make a figure in the great world these accomplishments joined to a natural fine genius a graceful person and a beneficent courteous disposition gained him the esteem of all who knew him  he was the darling of his uncle but in this happy state he following the dictates of love before those of his interest unknown to his uncle espoused a young lady whose only want was a fortune sufficient to render her a match suitable for the heir of sir geofry   tha upon my word i commend his notion   y wood this imprudence of the young gentleman so exasperated the old knight that when he heard of it he swore he should never be a shilling the better for him refused to see him and now this unfortunate couple are obliged to subsist upon a small patrimony left him by his father in a remote part of cornwall   del by your account i really pity them and wish with my soul for their sake as well as my own the current of his affections could be turned to its former channel   y wood oh it is the most inflexible positive curmudgeon you might as soon persuade a jewish rabbi to turn jesuit   tha a rabbit turn jeshit  upon my soul a comical change howsomever they have very pretty boroughs where we were they call em colleges   y wood he is so fixed on the completion of this marriage that to make sure of my fathers consent he has offered to take emily without a portion there he touched the vein my father at first shocked at such an odd proposition gave his old friend very little encouragement but the mention of no fortune together with sir geofrys great estate stifled all parental tenderness and he now exerts all his authority to oblige poor emily to name the day and till then to look upon sir geofry as a gentleman whom his prudence has destined her for a husband you may judge the distress these commands gave her and the conflict she suffers between her aversion to sir geofry and the consequence of her acquiescence to her fathers will   del poor dear girl but could i not get a sight of her   wood oh by no means if my father knew of your arrival twould bar all access to your future happiness as he would oblige her to marry sir geofry immediately as yet i will not inform

tumbling over head and heels in a filthy kennel by way of a somerset then i was in danger of suffocating and the breaking of my neck next i that was never over valiant must make a trial of my prowess on irishman a fellow  firm as his country oak but  must do him the justice to own that  some of the generosity of an irish  pounding me to mummy when he  down which i cannot deny but i deserved then to be luggd to the roundhouse like a thief where i was almost stifled with tobacco  well that expelled vlier scents with which i suppose the plce abounded among cutthroats pickpockets  oh hers comes sir anthony   enter sir anthony sir ant ha sir geofry a good morning youre a brisk lover adod youre resolved your mistress shall not forget you    sir geo i dont know how to open the matter him  aside sir anthony i thank you but it gives me infinite concern as i should be proud of our alliance that i must be obliged to forget her  but    sir ant but what what   sir geo though for reasons which perhaps you may find out hereafter i must stop all further proceedings with regard to my marriage with your daughter    sir ant how   sir geo yes sir with your daughter yet i hope it will not break the friendship so long subsisting between you and i    sir ant how stop the proceedings of the marriage what is the meaning of all this stop the proceedings of the marriage   sir geo yes sir upon cool and proper reflection i have considered twould be a very imprudent thing for a person of my age in the wane of life to espouse a lady so young and possessed of so much beauty as miss emily   sir ant sir geofry sir geofry is this a time for your cool and your proper reflections  very well sir very well  sir sir let me tell you you have used me ill in the tenderest point sir and dont think it shall pass with impunity  but sir i see i see through the shallow gloss you have given it i see your mean fordid reason for recanting your repentance of the offer you made me of taking my child without a portion there sir is your reason fie fie fie   sir geo ungenetous man to put such an evil construction upon and concealing that which you shall know to your confusion since i have no other means of justification know sir your daughters a prostitute now sir you know my reason delamours the man who has dishonored her i saw him let into this house at two oclock this morning there is the mandate he obeyed there sir read that perhaps you know your daughters hand delamour accidentally dropped it out of his pocket and i picked it up besides i heard it all from his servant   sir ant reads come this night exactly at two oclock and betty will conduct you to the longing arms of emily  oh unhappy girl wretched wretched father  my friend forgive me    sir geo from my soul  i knew the effect the knowledge of this unfortunate affair would have on you therefore i intended you should never know a syllable of it from me   sir ant here going to the wing here who is there i will turn the ungracious wretch out of my doors this instant to meet the infamy she deserves  what to make my house a brothel  as for her seducer i will    sir geo no no hear reason get the better of your choler your exposing her in that manner would be wrong quite wrong give me leave to advise you  keep the whole a secret even from your servants as for betty she has been her confidant send immediately to delamour found him about a marriage with emily  i know his circumstances perfectly as some of his land borders upon mine he has a very pretty estate but a little encumbered owing to some extravagancies incident to young men of his volatile disposition the fortune which i refused with emily will help to clear his estate and pay off his sister florimels fortune these considerations joined to an innate principle of honor which i never knew him deviate from till now perhaps may influence him to accept of your offer but dont you mention the least knowledge of their intercourse  what think ye   sir ant why i dont know my dear friend youre too good too good indeed and so should i be to follow your advice  but though she has gone astray yet she is still my child  were i sure he would cover her shame by marriage with pleasure i would double her portion  but it is most amazing  i did not think delamour was returned from france  oh sure if i knew he was in the same kingdom i should have taken better care of her but however i will send for him immediately  but it is to no purpose  a likely thing a young fellow like him would tie himself for life to one he has gained upon such easy terms and as for trusting to his honor the young fellows of this age use the bare word as an instrument of deception on the weaker sex the practice to them is a mere jest indeed her fortune i dont know what that may
