much were men displeased with the present conduct of affairs and such apprehensions were entertained of futurity that the people overlooking their theological disputes expressed a very general and unseigned joy that the scepter had passed into the hands of elizabeth that princess had discovered great prudence in her conduct during the reign of her sister and as men were sensible of the imminent danger to which she was every moment exposed the compassion toward her situation and concern for her safety had rendered her to an uncommon degree the favorite of the nation a parliament had been assembled a few days before marys death and when heathe archbishop of york then chancellor notified to them that event scarce an interval of regret appeared and the two houses immediately resounded with the joyful acclamations of god save queen elizabeth long and happily may she reign the people less actuated by faction and less influenced by private views expressed a joy still more general and hearty on her proclamation and the auspicious commencement of this reign prognosticated that felicity and glory which during its whole course so uniformly attended it pnet vol ii p      elizabeth was at hatfield when she heard of her sisters death and after a few days she proceeded thence to london through crowds of people who strove with each other in giving her the strongest testimony of their affections on her entrance into the tower she could not forbear reflecting on the great difference between her present fortune and that which a few years before had attended her when she was conducted to that place as a prisoner and lay there exposed to all the bigoted malignity of her enemies she fell on her knees and expressed her thanks to heaven for the deliverance which the almighty had granted her from her bloody persecutors a deliverance she said no less miraculous than that which daniel had received from the den of lions this act of pious gratitude seems to have been the last circumstance in which she remembered any past injuries and hardships with a prudence and magnanimity truly laudable she buried all offenses in oblivion and received with asfability even those who had acted with the greatest virulence against her sir harry bennifield himself to whose custody she had been committed and who had treated her with uncommon severity never felt during the whole course of her reign any effects of her resentment ibid p      yet was not the gracious reception which she gave prostitute and undistinguishing when the bishops came in a body to make their obeisance to her she expressed to all of them sentiments of regard except to bonner from whom she turned aside as from a man polluted with blood who was a just object of horror to every heart susceptible of humanity ibid heylin p  0    after employing a few days in ordering her domestic affairs elizabeth notified to foreign courts her sisters death and her own accession to the crown she sent lord cobham to the low countries where philip then resided and she took care to express to that monarch her gratitude for the protection which he had assorded her and her desire of presevering in that friendship which was so happily commenced between them philip who had long foreseen this event and who still hoped by means of elizabeth to obtain that dominion over england which he had failed of in espousing mary immediately dispatched orders to the duke of feria his ambassador at london to make proposals of marriage to the queen and he offered to procure from rome a dispensation for that purpose but elizabeth soon came to the resolution of declining this proposal she saw that the nation had entertained an extreme aversion to the spanish alliance during her sisters reign and that one great cause of the popularity which she herself enjoyed was the prospect of being freed by her means from the danger of foreign subjection she was sensible that her affinity with philip was exactly similar to that between her father and catherine of arragon and that her marrying that monarch was in effect declaring herself illegitimate and incapable of succeeding to the throne and though the power of the spanish monarchy might still be sufficient in opposition to all pretenders to support her title her masculine spirit disdained such precarious dominion which as it would depend solely on the power of another must be exercised according to his inclination amden in kennet p   burnet vol ii p   but while these views prevented her from entertaining any thoughts of a marriage with philip she gave him a very obliging though evasive answer and he still retained such hopes of success that he sent a messenger to rome with orders to solicit the dispensation  the queen too on her sisters death had wrote to sir edward carne the english ambassador at rome to signify her accession to the pope but the precipitate nature of paul broke through all the cautious measures concerted by that young princess he told carne that england was a sief of the holy see and it was a great temerity in her to have assumed without his participation the title and authority of queen that elizabeth being illegitimate could not possibly init that kingdom nor could he annul the sentence pronounced by clement the seventh and paul the third with regard to henrys marriage that were he to proceed with rigor he would punish this criminal invasion of his rights by rejecting all her applications but being willing to treat her with paternal indulgence he would still keep the door of grace open to her and that if she would renounce all pretensions to the throne and submit entirely to his will she should experience the utmost lenity which was compatible with the dignity of the apostolic see   when this answer was reported to elizabeth she was asonished at the character of that aged pontiff and having recalled her a  e continued with more determined resolution to pursue those measures which the had already secretly embraced  the queen not to alarm the partisans of the catholic religion had retained eleven of her sisters counselors but in order to balance their authority she added eight more who were known to be affectionate to the protestant communion the marquis of northampton the earl of bedford sir thomas parry sir edward rogers sir ambrose cave sir francis knolles sir nicholas bacon whom she created lord keeper and sir william cecil secretary of state strypes ann vol i p   reestablishment of the protestant religion with these counselors particularly cecil she frequently deliberated concerning the expediency of restoring the protestant religion and the means of executing that great enterprise cecil told her that the greatest part of the nation had ever since her fathers reign inclined to the reformation and though her sister had constrained them to profess the ancient faith the cruelties exercised by her ministers had still more alienated their affections from it that happily the interests of the sovereign concurred here with the inclinations of the people nor was her title to the crown compatible with the authority of the roman pontiff that a sentence so solemnly pronounced by two popes against her mothers marriage could not possibly be recalled without inflicting a mortal wound on the credit of the sea of rome and even if she was allowed to retain the crown it would only be on an uncertain and dependant footing that this motive counterballanced all dangers whatever and these dangers themselves if narrowly viewed would be found very little formidable that the curses and execrations of the romish church when not seconded by military force were in the present age more an object of ridicule than of terror and had now as little influence in this world as in the next that though the bigotry or ambition of henry or philip might incline them to execute a sentence of excommunication against her their interests were so incompatible that they never could concur in any plan of operations and the enmity of the one would always ensure to her the friendship of the other that if they encouraged the discontents of her catholic subjects their dominions also abounded with protestants and it would be easy to retaliate that injury upon them that even such of the english as seemed at present zealously attached to the catholic faith would most of them embrace the religion of their new sovereign and the nation had of late been so accustomed to these revolutions that men had lost all idea of truth and falsehood in such subjects that the authority of henry the eighth so highly raised by many concurring circumstances first enured the people to this submissive deference and it was more easy for the succeeding princes to continue the nation in a train to which it had been so long accustomed and that it would be easy for her by bestowing on protestants all the commissions in civil offices and the militia the church and the universities both to ensure her own authority and to render her religion entirely predominant burnet vol ii p     camden p   0   the education of elizabeth as well as her interest led her to favor the reformation and she remained not long in suspense with regard to the party which she should embrace but though determined in her own mind she resolved to proceed by gradual and secure steps and not to imitate the example of mary in encouraging the bigots of her party to make immediately a violent invasion on the established religion burnet vol ii p     camden p      she thought it requisite however to discover such symptoms of her intentions as might give encouragement to the protestants so much depressed by the late violent persecution she immediately recalled all the exiles and gave liberty to the prisoners who were confined on account of religion we are told of a pleasantry of one rainsford on this occasion who said to the queen that he had a petition to present her in behalf of other prisoners called matthew mark luke and john she readily replied that it behoved her first to consult the prisoners themselves and to learn of them whether they desired that liberty which he demanded for them heylin p  0    elizabeth also proceeded to exert in favor of the reformers some acts of power which were consistent with the extent of the royal prerogative during that age finding that the protestant teachers irritated by persecution broke out in a furious attack of the ancient superstition and that the romanists replied with no less zeal and acrimony she published a proclamation by which she prohibited all preaching without a special license heylin p  0  strype vol i p     and though she dispensed with this prohibition in favor of some preachers of her own sect she took care that they should be the most calm and moderate of the party she also suspended the laws so far as to order a great part of the service the litany the lords prayer the creed and the gospels to be read in english and having first published injunctions that all the churches should conform themselves to the practice of her own chapel she forbade the host to be any more elevated in her presence an innovation which however frivolous it may appear implied the most material consequences camden p  heylin p  0  strype vol i p    stowe p      these declarations of her intention concurring with the preceding suspicions made the bishops foresee with certainty a revolution in religion they therefore refused to officiate at her coronation and it  with some difficulty that the bishop of carlisle was at last prevailed on to perform that ceremony when she was conducted through london amidst the joyful acclamations of her subjects a boy who personated truth was let down from one of the triumphal arches and presented her with a copy of the bible she received the book with the most gracious deportment placed it next her bosom and declared that amidst all the costly testimonies which the city had that day given of their attachment this present was by far the most precious and most acceptable  vol ii p  vol i p    such were the innocent artifices by which elizabeth insinuated herself into the affections of her subjects open in her address gracious and affable in all public appearances she rejoiced in the concourse of her subjects entered into all their pleasures and amusements and without departing from her dignity which she knew well how to preserve she acquired a popularity beyond what any of her predecessors or successors ever could attain her own sex exulted to see a woman hold the reins of empire with such prudence and fortitude and while a young princess of twentyfive years for that was her age at her accession who possessed all the graces and insinuation though not all the beauty of her sex courted the affections of individuals by her civilities of the public by her services her authority though corroborated by the strictest bands of law and religion appeared to be derived entirely from the choice and inclination of the people  a parliament and elizabeth though she threw out such hints as encouraged the protestants delayed the entire change of religion till the meeting of the parliament which was summoned to assemble the elections had gone entirely against the catholics who seem not indeed to have made any great struggle for the superiority and the houses met in a disposition of gratifying the queen in every particular which she could desire of them they began the session with an unanimous declaratin that queen elizabeth was and ought to be as well by the word of god as the common and statute laws of the realm the lawful undoubted and true heir to the crown lawfully descended from the blood royal according to the order of succession settled in the   th of henry viii   this act of recognition was undoubtedly dictated by the queen herself and her ministers and she showed her magnanimity as well as  in the terms which she employed on that occasion she followed not  in  the validity of her mothers marriage or in expressly repealing the  formerly made against her own legitimacy she know that this attempt must be atted with reflection on her fathers memory as well as on the birth of her deceased sister and as all the world were sensible that henrys divorce from anne boleyn was merely the effect of his violence and caprice she scorned to found her title on any act of an assembly which had too much prostituted its authority by its former variable servile and iniquitous decisions satisfied therefore in the general opinion entertained with regard to this fact which appeared the more undoubted the less anxiety she discovered in fortifying it by votes and enquiries she took possession of the throne both as her birthright and as ensured to her by former acts of parliament and she never appeared sollicitous to distinguish these titles camden p     heylin p  0   0    the first bill which was brought into the parliament with a view of trying their disposition with regard to religion was that for suppressing the monasteries lately erected and for restoring the tenths and first fruits to the queen this point being gained without much difficulty a bill was next introduced annexing the supremacy to the crown and though the queen was there denominated governess not head of the church it conveyed the same extensive power which had formerly been exercised by her father and brother all the bishops who were present in the upper house strenuously opposed this law and as they possessed more learning than the temporal peers they triumphed in the argument but the majority of voices in that house as well as among the commons were against them by this act the crown without the concurrence either of the parliament or even of the convocation was vested with the whole spiritual power might repress all heresies in determining heresy the crown was only limited if that could be called a limitation to such doctrines as had been adjudged heresy by the auth rity of the scripture by the first four general  or by any general council which followed the scripture as their rule or to such other doctrines as should hereafter be denominated heresy by the parliament and convocation   eliz cap    might establish or repeal all canons might alter every point of discipline and might ordain or abolish any religious rite or ceremony   eliz cap   this last power was anew granted in the act of uniformity   eliz cap    in order to exercise this unlimited authority the queen by a clause of the act was empowered to name commissioners either laymen or clergymen as she should think proper and on this clause was afterward founded the court of ecclesiastical commission which assumed very large discretionary not to say arbitrary powers totally incompatible with any exact limitations in the constitution their proceedings indeed were only consistent with absolute monarchy but were entirely suitable to the genius of the act on which they were established an act that at once gave the crown all the power which had formerly been claimed by the popes but which even these usurping prelates had never been able fully to exercise without some concurrence of the clergy  whoever refused to take an oath acknowledging the queens supremacy was incapacitated from holding any office whoever denied the supremacy or attempted to deprive the queen of that prerogative forfeited for the first offense all their goods and chattels for the second were subjected to the penalty of a praemunire but the third offense was declared treason these punishments however severe were less rigorous than such as were formerly during the reigns of her father and brother inflicted in like cases  a law was passed confirming all the statutes enacted in king edwards time with regard to religion  eliz cap    the nomination of bishops was given to the crown without any election of the chapters the queen was empowered on the vacancy of any see to seize all the temporalities and to bestow on the bishopselect an equivalent in the impropriations belonging to the crown this pretended equivalent was commonly very much inferior in value and thus the queen amidst all her concern for religion followed the example of the preceding reformers in committing depredations on the ecclesiastical revenues  the bishops and all incumbents were prohibited from alienating their revenues and from letting leases longer than twentyone years or three lives this law seemed to be intended for securing the property of the church but as an exception was left in favor of the crown great abuses still prevailed it was usual for a courtier during this reign to make a transaction with a bishop or incumbent and to procure a sham alienation to the queen who afterward transferred the lands to the person agreed on strype vol i p     this method of pillaging the church was not remedied till the beginning of james the first the present depression of the clergy exposed them to all injuries and the laity never stopped till they had reduced the church to such poverty that her plunder was no longer a compensation for the odium incurred by it  a solemn and public disputation was held during this session in presence of lord keeper bacon between the divines of the protestant and those of the catholic party the champions appointed to defend the religion of the sovereign were as in former instances entirely triumphant and the popish disputants being pronounced refractory and obstinate were even punished by imprisonment ibid p     emboldened by this victory the protestants ventured on the last and most important step and brought into parliament a bill   eliz cap   for abolishing the mass and reestablishing the liturgy of king edward penalties were enacted as well against those who departed from this mode of worship as those who absented themselves from the church and the sacraments and thus in one session without any violence tumult or clamor was the whole system of religion altered on the very commencement of a reign and by the will of a young woman whose title to the crown was by many esteemed liable to great objections an event which though it may appear surprising to men in the present age was every where expected on the first news of her accession  the commons also made a sacrifice to the queen more difficult to obtain than that of any articles of religion they voted a subsidy of four shillings in the pound on land and two shillings and eight pence on goods together with two fifteenths the parliament also granted the queen the duties of tonnage and poundage but this concession was at that time regarded only as a matter of form and she had levied these duties before they were voted by the parliament but there was another exertion of power which she practiced and which people in this age from their ignorance of the ancient constitution may be apt to think a little extraordinary her sister after the commencement of the war with france had from her own authority imposed four marks on each ton of wine imported and had increased the poundage a third on ail commodities queen elizabeth continued these impositions as long as she thought convenient the parliament who had so good an opportunity of restraining these arbitrary taxes when they voted the tonnage and poundage thought proper not to make any mention of them they knew that the sovereign during that age pretended to have the sole regulation of foreign trade and that their intermed lling with that prerogative would have drawn on them the severest reproof if not chastisement see forbes vol i p         we know certainly from the statutes and journals that no such unpositions were granted by parliament  the house in no instance departed from the most respectful deference and complaisance toward the queen even the importunate address which they made her on the conclusion of the session to fix her choice of a husband could not they supposed be very disagreeable to one of her sex and age the address was couched in the most respectful expressions yet met with a refusal from the queen she told the speaker that as the application from the house was conceived in general terms only recommending marriage without pretending to direct her choice of a husband she could not take offense at the address or regard it as other than a new instance of their affectionate attachment toward her that any farther interposal on their part would have ill become either them to make as subjects or her to hear as an independent princess that even while she was a private person and exposed to much danger she had always declined that engagement which she regarded as an encumbrance much more at present would she persevere in that sentiment when the charge of a great kingdom was committed to her and her life ought to be entirely dedicated to promoting the interests of religion and the happiness of her subjects that as england was her husband wedded to her by this pledge and here she showed them her singer with the same gold ring upon it with which she had solemnly betrothed herself to the kingdom at her inauguration so all englishmen were her children and while she was employed in the rearing or governing such a family she could not esteem herself barren or her life useless and unfruitful that if she ever entertained thoughts of changing her condition the care of her subjects welfare would still be uppermost in her thoughts but should she live and die a virgin she doubted not but the divine providence seconded by their counsels and her own measures would be able to prevent all dispute with regard to the succession and secure them a sovereign who perhaps better than her own issue would imitate her example in loving and cherishing her people and that for her part she desired that no higher character nor fairer remembrance of her should be transmitted to posterity than to have this inscription engraved on her tombstone when she should pay the last debt to nature here lies elizabeth who lived and died a maiden queen camden p     sir simon dewes    th may after the prorogation of the parliament it is thought remarkable by camden that though this session was the first of the reign no person was attainted but on the contrary some restored in blood by the parliament a good symptom of the lenity at least of the prudence of the queens government  the laws enacted with regard to religion were put in execution and met with no disturbance or opposition from any quarter the liturgy was again introduced in the vulgar tongue and the oath of supremacy was tendered to the clergy the number of bishops had been reduced to fourteen by a very sickly season which preceded and all of these except the bishop of landaffe having refused compliance were degraded from their sees but of the inferior clergy throughout all england where there are near  0000 parishes only eighty parish rectors fifty prebendaries fifteen heads of colleges twelve archdeacons and as many deans sacrificed their livings to their religious principles camden p     heylin p     strype vol i p   with some small variations  those in high ecclesiastical stations who were exposed to the eyes of the world seem chiefly to have placed a point of honor in their perseverance but on the whole the protestants in the former change introduced by mary appear to have been much more rigid and conscientious though the catholic religion adapting itself to the senses and requiring observances which enter into the common train of life does at present lay much faster hold of the mind than the reformed which being chiefly spiritual resembles more a system of metaphysics yet was the proportion of zeal as well as of knowledge during the first ages after the reformation much greater on the side of the protestants the catholics continued ignorantly and supinely in their ancient belief or rather their ancient practices but the reformers obliged to dispute on every occasion and enflamed to a degree of enthusiasm by novelty and persecution had strongly attached themselves to their tenets and were ready to sacrifice their fortunes and even their lives in defense of their speculative and abstract principles the forms and ceremonies still preserved in the english liturgy as they bore some resemblance to the ancient service tended farther to reconcile the catholics to the established religion and as the queen permitted no other mode of worship and at the same time struck out every thing that could be offensive to them in the new liturgy heylin p      even those addicted to the romish communion made no scruple of attending the established church had elizabeth gratified her own inclinations the exterior appearance which is the chief circumstance with the people would have been still more similar between the new and the ancient form of worship as she loved state and magnificence in every thing she was somewhat addicted to the pomp of the catholic religion and it was merely in compliance with the prejudices of her party that she gave up either the images or the addresses to the saints or prayers for the dead burnet vol ii p        camden p   some foreign princes interposed to procure the romanists the privilege of separate assemblies in particular cities but the queen would not comply with their request and represented the manifest danger of disturbing the national peace by a toleration of different religions camden p   suype vol i p   0   0   peace with france while the queen and parliament were employed in settling the public religion the negotiations for a peace were still conducted first at cercamp then at chateaucambresis between the ministers of france spain and england and elizabeth though equally prudent was not so successful in this transaction philip employed his utmost efforts to procure the restitution of calais both as bound in honor to indemnify england which merely on his account had been drawn into the war and as engaged in interest to remove france from his frontiers in the low countries so long as he entertained hopes of espousing the queen he delayed concluding a peace with henry and even after the change of religion in england deprived him of all such views his ministers hinted a proposal which may be regarded as reasonable and honorable after all his own terms with france were settled he seemed willing to continue the war till she should obtain satisfaction provided she would stipulate to adhere to the spanish alliance and continue hostilities against henry during the course of six years forbes full view vol i p     but elizabeth after consulting with her ministers very wisely rejected this proposal she was sensible of the low state of her finances the great debts contracted by her father brother and sister the disorders introduced into every part of the administration the divisions by which her people were agitated and she was convinced that nothing but tranquillity during some years could bring the kingdom again into a flourishing condition or enable her to act with dignity and vigor in her transactions with foreign nations well acquainted with the value which henry put upon calais and the impossibility of recovering it by treaty during the present emergency she was willing rather to suffer that loss than submit to such a dependence on spain as she must expect to fall into if she continued pertinaciously in her present demand she ordered therefore her ambassadors the lord effingham the bishop of ely and dr wotton to conclude the negotiation and to settle a peace with henry or any reasonable terms henry offered to stipulate a marriage between the eldest daughter of the dauphin and the eldest son of elizabeth and to engage for the restitution of calais as the dowry of that princess forbes vol i p     but as the queen was sensible that this treaty would appear to the world a palpable evasion she insisted upon more equitable at least more plausible conditions it was at last agreed that henry should restore calais at the expiration of eight years that in case of failure he should pay five hundred thousand crowns and the queens title to calais still remain that he should find the security of seven or eight foreign merchants not natives of france for the payment of this sum that he should deliver five hostages till that security was provided that if elizabeth broke the peace with france or scotland during that interval she should forfeit all title to calais but if henry made war on elizabeth he should be obliged immediately to restore that fortress ibid p    rymer tom xv p  0   every person of penetration easily saw that these stipulations were but a colorable pretense for abandoning calais but they excused the queen on account of the necessity of her affairs and they even extolled her prudence in submitting without farther struggle to that necessity a peace with scotland was a necessary consequence of that with france  philip and henry concluded hostilities with a mutual restitution of all places taken during the course of the war and philip espoused the princess elizabeth eldest daughter of france formerly betrothed to his son don carlos the duke of savoy married margaret henrys sister and obtained a restitution of all his dominions of savoy and piedmont except a few towns retained by france and thus general tranquillity semed to be restored to europe  disgust between the queen and mary queen of scots but though a peace was signed and concluded between france and england there soon appeared a ground of quarrel of the most serious nature and which was afterward attended with the most important consequences the two marriages of henry the eighth that with catherine of arragon and that with anne boseyn were totally incompatible with each other and it seemed impossible that both of them could be regarded as valid and legal but still the birth of elizabeth lay under some disadvantages to which that of her sister mary was not exposed henrys first marriage had obtained the sanction of all the powers both civil and ecclesiastical which were then acknowleged in england and it was natural for protestants as well as romanists to allow on account of the sincere intention of the parties that their issue ought to be regarded as legitimate but his divorce and second marriage had been concluded in direct opposition to the sea of rome and though they had been ratified by the authority both of the english parliament and convocation those who were strongly attached to the catholic church and who reasoned with great strictness were led to regard them as entirely invalid and to deny altogether the queens right of succession the next heir of blood was the queen of scots now married to the dauphin and the great power of that princess joined to her plausible title rendered her a very formidable rival to elizabeth the king of france had secretly been soliciting at rome a bull of excommunication against the queen and she had here been beholden to the good offices of philip who from interest more than either friendship or principle had negociated in her favor and had successfully opposed the pretensions of henry but the court of france was not discouraged with this repulse the duke of guise and his brothers thinking that it would much augment their credit if their niece should bring an accession of england as she had already done of scotland to the crown of france engaged the king not to neglect the claim and by their persuasion he ordered his son and daughterinlaw to assume openly the arms as well as title of england and to quarter these arms on all their equipages furniture and liveries when the english ambassador complained of this injury he could obtain nothing but an evasive answer that as the queen of scots was descended from the blood royal of england she was entitled by the example of many princes to assume the arms of that kingdom but besides that this practice had never prevailed without permission being first obtained and without making a visible difference between the arms elizabeth plainly saw that this pretension had not been advanced during the reign of her sister mary and that therefore the king of france intended on the first opportunity to dispute her legitimacy and her title to the crown alarmed with the danger she thenceforth conceived a strong jealousy against the queen of scots and was determined as far as possible to incapacitate henry from the execution of his project the sudden death of that monarch who was killed in a tournament at paris while he was celebrating the espousals of his sister with the duke of savoy altered not her views being informed that his successor francis the second still continued to assume without reserve the title of king of england she began to consider him and his queen as her most mortal enemies and the present situation of affairs in scotland afforded her a favorable opportunity both of revenging the injury and of providing for her own safety  scotch affairs the murder of the cardinalprimate at st andrews had deprived the scotch catholics of a head whose severity courage and capacity had rendered him extremely formidable to the innovators in religion and the execution of the laws against heresy began thenceforth to be much more remiss and gentle the queenregent governed the kingdom by prudent and moderate councils and as she was not disposed to sacrifice the civil interests of the state to the bigotry or interests of priests she esteemed it more expedient to temporize and to connive at the progress of a doctrine which she had not power entirely to repress when informed of the death of edward and the accession of mary to the crown of england she entertained hopes that the scottish reformers deprived of the countenance which they received from that powerful kingdom would lose their ardour with their prospect of success and would gradually return to the faith of their ancestors but the progress and revolutions of religion are little governed by the usual maxims of civil policy and the event much disappointed the regents expectations many of the english preachers terrified with the severity of marys government took shelter in scotland where they found more protection and a milder administration and while they propagated their theological tenets they filled that whole kingdom with a just horror against the cruelties of the bigoted catholics and showed their disciples the fate which they must expect if ever their adversaries should attain an uncontrouled authority over them  a hierarchy moderate in its acquisitions of power and riches may safely grant a toleration to sectaries and the more it abates the fervor of innovators by lenity and liberty the more securely will it possess those advantages which the legal establishments bestow upon it but where superstition has raised a church to such an exorbitant height as that of rome persecution is less the result of bigotry in the priests than of a necessary policy and the rigor of law is the only method of repelling the attacks of men who besides religious zeal have so many other motives derived both from public and private interest to engage them on the side of innovation but though such overgrown hierarchies may long support themselves by these violent expedients the time comes when severities tend only to enrage the new sectaries and make them break through all bounds of reason and moderation this crisis was now visibly approaching in scotland and whoever considers merely the transactions resulting from it will be inclined to throw the blame equally on both parties whoever enlarges his view and reflects on the situations will observe the necessary progress of human affairs and the operation of those principles which are inherent in human nature  reformation in scotland some heads of the reformers in scotland such as the earl of argyle his son lord lorne the earls of morton and glencarne erskine of dun and others finding the danger to which they were exposed and desirous to propagate their principles entered privately into a bond or association and called themselves the congregation of the lord in contradistinction to the established church which they denominated the congregation of satan the tenor of the bond was as follows we perceiving how satan in his members the antichrists of our time do cruelly rage seeking to overthrow and to destroy the gospel of christ and his congregation ought according to our bounden duty to strive in our masters cause even unto the death being certain of the victory in him we do therefore promise before the majesty of god and his congregation that we by his grace shall with all diligence continually apply our whole power substance and our very lives to maintain set forward and establish the most blessed word of god and his congregation and shall labor by all possible means to have faithful ministers truly and purely to minister christs gospel and sacraments to his people we shall maintain them nourish them and defend them the whole congregation of christ and every member thereof by our whole power and at the hazard of our lives against satan and all wicked power who may intend tyranny and trouble against the said congregation unto which holy word and congregation we do join ourselves and we forsake and renounce the congregation of satan with all the superstitious abomination and idolatry thereof and moreover shall declare ourselves manifestly enemies thereto by this faithful promise before god testified to this congregation by our subscriptions at edinburgh the third of december      keith p    knox p  0    had the subscribers of this zealous league been contented only to demand a toleration of the new opinions however incompatible their pretensions might have been with the policy of the church of rome they would have had the praise of opposing tyrannical laws enacted to support an establishment prejudicial to civil society but it is plain that they carried their views much farther and their practice immediately discovered the spirit by which they were actuated supported by the authority which they thought belonged to them as the congregation of the lord they ordained that prayers in the vulgar tongue the reformers used at that time king edwards liturgy in scotland fores p     should be used in all the parish churches of the kingdom and that preaching and the interpretation of the scriptures should be practiced in private houses till god should move the prince to grant public preaching by faithful and true ministers kith p    knox p  0   such bonds of association are always the forerunners of rebellion and this violent invasion of the established religion was the actual commencement of it  before this league was publicly known or avowed the clergy alarmed with the progress of the reformation attempted to recover their lost authority by a violent exercise of power which tended still farther to augment the zeal and number of their enemies hamilton the primate seized walter mill a priest of an irreproachable life who had embraced the new doctrines and having tried him at st andrews condemned him to the flames for heresy such general aversion was discovered to this barbarity that it was some time before the bishops could prevail on any one to act the part of a civil judge and pronounce the sentence upon him and even after the time of his execution was fixed all the shops of st andrews being shut no one would sell a rope to tie him to the stake and the primate himself was obliged to furnish this implement the man bore the torture with that courage which though usual on these occasions always appears astonishing and supernatural to the multitude the people to express their abhorrence against the cruelty of the priests raised a monument of stones on the place of his execution and as fast as the stones were removed by order of the clergy they were again supplied from the voluntary zeal of the populace knox p      it is vain for men to oppose the severest punishments to the united principles of religion and public applause and this was the last barbarity of the kind which the catholics had the power to exercise in scotland  some time after the people discovered their sentiments in such a manner as was sufficient to prognosticate to the priests the fate which was awaiting them it was usual on the festival of st giles the tutelar saint of edinburgh to carry in procession the image of that saint but the protestants in order to prevent the ceremony found means on the eve of the festival to purloin the statue from the church and they please themselves with imagining the astonishment and disappointment of his votaries the clergy however sramed hastily a new image which in derision was called by the people young st giles and they carried it through the streets attended with all the ecclesiastics in the town and neighborhood the multitude abstained from violence so long as the queenregent continued a spectator but the moment she retired they invaded the idol threw it in the dirt and broke it in pieces the flight and terror of the priests and friars who it was remarked deserted in his greatest distress the object of their worship was the source of universal mockery and laughter  encouraged by all these appearances the congregation proceeded with alacrity in openly soliciting subscriptions to their league and the death of mary of england with the accession of elizabeth which happened about this time contributed much to increase their hopes of final success in their undertaking they ventured to present a petition to the regent craving a reformation of the church and of the wicked scandalous and detestable lives of the prelates and ecclesiastics knox p      they applied to the parliament by a petition in which after premising that they could not communicate with the damnable idolatry and intolerable abuses of the papistical church they desired that the laws against heretics should be executed by the civil magistrate alone and that the scripture should be the sole rule for judging of heresy ibid p      they even petitioned the convocation and insisted that prayers should be said in the vulgar tongue and that bishops should be chosen with the consent of the gentry of the diocese and priests with the consent of the parishioners keith p           the regent prudently temporized between these parties and as she aimed at procuring a matrimonial crown for her soninlaw the dauphin she was on that as well as other accounts unwilling to come to extremities with either of them  but after this concession was obtained she received orders from france probably dictated by the haughty spirit of her brothers to proceed with violence against the reformers and to restore the royal authority by some signal act of power melvils memoirs p    jebb vol ii p      she made the most eminent of the protestant teachers be cited to appear before the council at stirling but when their followers were marching thither in great multitudes in order to protect and countenance them she entertained apprehensions of an insurrection and dissipated the people by a promise knox p     we shall suggest afterward some reasons to suspect that perhap no  promise was given calumnies easily arise during times of faction  kind when men think every  lawful for promoting their purpose  where they enumerate all the articles of the regent  with the breach of  it  probably nothing but  if the  have sometime maintained that no faith wa  seem also to have thought that no truth ought to be rold of   that nothing should be done to the prejudice of the ministers this promise was violated and a sentence passed by which all the ministers were pronounced rebels on account count of their not appearing a measure so rash and ill advised enraged the people and made them resolve to resist her authority by force of arms and to proceed to extremity against the clergy of the established religion  in this critical time john knox arrived from geneva where he had passed some years in banishment and where he had imbibed from his commerce with calvin the highest fanaticism of his sect augmented by the natural ferocity of his own character   th may he had been invited back to scotland by the leaders of the reformation and mounting the pulpit at perth during the present ferment of mens minds he declaimed with his usual vehemence against the idolatry and other abominations of the church of rome and incited his audience to exert their utmost zeal for its subversion a priest was so imprudent after this sermon as to open his repository of images and relicts and prepare himself to say mass the audience who were wrought up to a disposition for any furious enterprise were as much enraged as if the spectacle had not been quite familiar to them they attacked the priest with fury broke the images in pieces tore the pictures overthrew the altars scattered about the sacred vases and lest no implement of idolatrous worship as they called it entire or unbroken they thence proceeded with additional numbers and augmented rage to the monasteries of the gray and black friars which they pillaged in an instant the carthusians underwent the same fate and the populace not content with robbing and expelling the monks vented their fury on the buildings which had been the recepticles of such abomination and in a very little time nothing but the walls of these stately edifices were left standing the inhabitants of couper in fife soon after imitated the example spotswood p     knox p       civil wars in scotland the queenregent provoked at these violences assembled an army and prepared to chastise the rebels she had about two thousand french under her command with a few scotch troops and being assisted with such of the nobility as were well affected to her she pitched her camp within ten miles of perth even the earl of argyle and the lord james stuart prior of st andrews the queens natural brother though deeply engaged with the reformers attended the regent in this enterprise either because they blamed the fury of the populace or hoped by their influence and authority to mediate some agreement between the parties the congregation on the other hand made preparations for defense and being joined by the earl of glencarne from the west and being countenanced by many of the nobility and gentry they appeared formidable from their numbers as well as the zeal by which they were animated they sent an address to the regent where they plainly insinuated that if they were pursued to extremity by the cruel beasts the churchmen they would have recourse to foreign powers for assistance and they subscribed themselves her faithful subjects in all things not repugnant to god assuming at the same time the name of the faithful congregation of christ jesus knox p      they applied to the nobility attending her and maintained that their past violences were justified by the word of god which commands the godly to destroy idolatry and all the monuments of it that though all civil authority was sacred yet was there a great difference between the authority and the persons who exercised it ibid p      and that it ought to be considered whether or not those abominations called by the pestilent papists religion and which they defend by fire and sword be the true religion of christ jesus they remonstrated with such of the queens army as had formerly embraced their party and told them that as they were already reputed traitors by god they should likewise be excommunicated from their society and from the participation of the sacraments of the church which god by his mighty power had erected among them whose ministers have the same authority which christ granted to his apostles in these words whose sins ye shall forgive shall be forgiven and whose sins ye shall retain shall be retained ibid p      we may here see that these new saints were no less lofty in their pretensions than the ancient hierarchy and it was therefore no wonder they were enraged against these latter as their rivals in dominion they joined to all these declarations an address to the established church and they affixed this title to it to the generation of antichrist the pestilent prelates and their shavelings a contemptu term for a priest in scotland the congregation of christ jesus within the same says the tenor of the manifesto was agreeable to the title they told the ecclesiastics as ye by tyranny intend not only to destroy our bodies but also by the same to hold our souls in bondage of the devil subject to idolatry so shall we with all the force and power which god shall grant unto us execute just vengeance and punishment upon you yea we shall begin that same war which god commanded israel to execute against the canaanites that is contract of peace shall never be made till ye desist from your open idolatry and cruel persecution of gods children and this in the name of the eternal god and of his son christ jesus whose verity we profess and gospel we have preached and holy sacraments rightly administered we signify unto you to be our intent so far as god will assist us to withstand your idolatry take this for warning and be not deceived keith p          knox p      with these outrageous symptoms commenced that cant hypocrisy and fanaticism which long infested that kingdom and which though now mollified by the lenity of the civil power is still ready to break out on all occasions  the queen regent finding such obstinate zeal in the malcontents was contented to embrace the councils of argyle and the prior of st andrews and to form an accommodation with them she was received into perth which submitted to her on promising an indemnity of past offenses and engaging not to leave any french garrison in the place this capitulation it is pretended was not exactly observed some of the inhabitants were molested on account of the late violences and some companies of scotch soldiers supposed to be in french pay were quartered in the town which step though taken under a very plausible pretext was regarded by the congregation as an infraction of the treaty knox p      it is asserted that the regent to justify these measures declared that princes ought not to have their promises too strictly urged upon them nor was any faith to be kept with heretics and that for her part could she find as good a color of reason she would willingly bereave all these men of their lives and fortunes ibid spotswood p      but it is no way likely that such expressions dropped from this prudent and virtuous princess on the contrary it appears that these violences were very disagreeable to her that she was in this particular overruled by the authority of the french counselors placed about her and that she often thought if the management of these affairs had been entrusted wholly to herself she could easily without force have accommodated all differences spotswood p     melvil p    knox p         lesly lib x that there was really no violation of the capitulation of perth appears from the manifesto of the congregation in knox p     where it is not so much as pretended the companies of scotch soldiers were probably in scotch pay since the congregation complains that the country was oppressed with taxes to maintain armies knox p         and even if they had been in french pay it were no breach of the capitulation since they were national troops not french knox does not say p     that any of the inhabitants of perth were tried or punished for their past offenses but only that they were oppressed with the quartering of soldiers and the congregation in their manifesto say only that many of them had fled for fear this plain detection of the calumny with regard to the breach of the capitulation of perth may make us suspect a like calumny with regard to the promise pretended not to give sentence against the ministers the affair lay altogether between the regent and the lord of dun and that gentleman though a man of sense and character might be willing to take some general professions for promise if the queen over awed by the power of the congregation gave such a promise in order to have liberty to proceed to a sentence how could she expect to have power to  a sentence so  obtained and to what purpose could it serve   the congregation enflamed with their own zeal and enraged with these disappointments remained not long in tranquillity even before they left perth and while as yet they had no color to complain of any violation of treaty they had signed a new covenant in which besides their engagements to mutual defense they vowed in the name of god to employ their whole power in destroying every thing that dishonored his holy name and this covenant was subscribed among others by argyle and the prior of st andrews keith p    knox p      these two leaders now desired no better pretext for deserting the regent and openly joining their associates than the complaints however doubtful or rather false of her breach of promise the congregation also encouraged by this accession of force gave up themselves entirely to the furious zeal of knox and renewed at crail anstruther and other places in fife like depredations on the churches and monasteries with those formerly committed at perth and couper the regent who marched against them with her army finding their power so much increased was glad to conclude a truce for a few days and to pass over with her forces to the lothians the insurgents besieged and took perth proceeded thence to stirling where they exercised their usual sury and finding nothing able to resist them they bent their march to edinburgh the inhabitants of which as they had already anticipated the zeal of the congregation against the churches and monasteries gladly opened their gates to them the regent with the few forces which remained with her took shelter in dunbar where she shut herself up in expectation of a reinforcement from france  meanwhile she employed her partisans in representing to the people the dangerous consequences of this open rebellion and she endeavored to convince them that the lord james under pretense of religion had formed the scheme of wresting the scepter from the hands of the sovereign by these considerations many were engaged to desert the army of the congregation but much more by the want of pay or any means of subsistence and the regent observing the insurgents to be much weakened ventured to march to edinburgh with a design to suppress them on the interposal of the duke of chatelraut who still adhered to her she agreed to a capitulation in which she granted them a toleration of their religion and they engaged to commit no farther depredations on the churches soon after they evacuated the city of edinburgh and before they left it they proclaimed the articles of agreement but they took care to publish only the articles favorable to themselves and they were guilty of an imposture in adding one to the number viz that idolatry shall not again be erected in any place where it was at that time suppressed knox p             this author pretends that this article was agreed to verbally but that the queens sbes omitted it in the treaty which was signed this  is very unlikely or rather very absurd and in the meantime it is allowed that the article is not in the treaty nor do the congregation in their subsequent manifesto insist upon it knox p       an agreement concluded while mens minds were in this disposition could not be durable and both sides endeavored to strengthen themselves as much as possible against the ensuing rupture which appeared inevitable the regent having got a reinforcement of  000 men from france began to fortify leith and the congregation seduced the duke of chatelraut to their party who had long appeared inclined to them and who was at last determined by the arrival of his son the earl of arran from france where he had escaped many dangers from the jealousy as well as bigotry of henry and the duke of guise more french troops soon after disembarked under the command of la brosse who was followed by the bishop of amiens and three doctors of the sorbonne these last were supplied with store of syllogisms authorities citations and scholastic arguments which they intended to oppose to the scotch preachers and which they justly presumed would acquire force and operate conviction on mens minds by the influence of the french arms and artillery spotswood p     thuan lib xxiv c  0   the constable montmorency had always opposed the marriage of the queen of scots with the dauphin and had foretold that by forming such close connexions with scotland the ancient league would be dissolved and the natives of that kingdom jealous of a foreign yoke would soon become instead of allies attached by interest and inclination the most inveterate enemies to the french dominion but though the event seemed now to have justified the prudence of that aged minister it is not improbable considering the violence of the councils by which france was governed that the insurrection was esteemed a favorable event as affording a pretense for sending over armies for entirely subduing the country for attainting the rebels forbes vol i p     thuan lib xxiv c     and for preparing means thence to invade england and support marys title to the crown of that kingdom the leaders of the congregation well acquainted with these views were not insensible of their danger and saw that their only safety consisted in the vigor and success of their measures they were encouraged by the intelligence received of the sudden death of henry the second and having passed an act from their own authority depriving the queen dowager of the regency and ordering all the french troops to evacuate the kingdom they collected forces to put their edict in execution against them they became masters again of edinburgh but found themselves unable to keep long possession of that city their tumultuary armies assembled in haste and supported by no pay soon separated themselves upon the least disaster or even any delay of success and were incapable of resisting such veteran troops as the french who were also seconded by some of the scotch nobility among whom the earl of bothwel distinguished himself hearing that the marquis of elbeuf brother to the regent was levying a new army against them in germany they thought themselves excusable for applying in this extremity to the assistance of england and as the sympathy of religion as well as regard to national liberty had now counterballanced the ancient animosity against that kingdom this measure was the result of inclination no less than of interest the scotch lords in their declaration say how far we have sought support of england  any other prince and what just cause we had and have so to do we shall shortly  unto the world to the praise of gods holy name and to the confusion of all those that  o doing for this we fear not to consl that as in this enterprise against the devil  ido atry and the maintainers

deliberated not long in assenting to this proposal which concurred so well with their views and interests cecil in particular represented to the queen that the union of the crowns of scotland and france both of them the hereditary enemies of england was ever regarded as a very pernicious event and her father as well as protector somerset had employed every expedient both of war and negotiation to prevent it that the claim which mary pretended to the crown rendered the present situation of england still more dangerous and demanded on the part of the queen the greatest vigilance and precaution that the capacity ambition and exorbitant views of the family of guise who now entirely governed the french councils were sufficiently known and they themselves made no secret of their design to advance their niece to the throne of england that deeming themselves secure of success they had already very imprudently and prematurely taken off the mask and throcmorton the english ambassador at paris sent over by every courier incontestible proofs of their hostile intentions  vol i p              0                                  that they only waited till scotland should be entirely subdued and having thus deprived the english of the advantage resulting from their situation and naval power they prepared means for subverting the queens authority that the zealous catholics in england discontented with the present government and satisfied with the legality of marys title would bring them considerable reinforcement and would disturb every measure of defense against that formidable power that the only expedient for preventing these designs was to seize the present opportunity and take advantage of a like zeal in the protestants of scotland nor could any doubt be entertained with regard to the justice of a measure founded on such evident necessity and directed only to the ends of selfpreservation that though a french war attended with great expense seemed the necessary consequence of supporting the scotch malcontents that power if removed to the continent could never be very formidable and a small disbursement at present would in the end be found the greatest frugality and that the domestic dissentions of france which every day augmented together with the support of philip who notwithstanding all his bigotry and hypocrisy would never permit the entire conquest of england were sufficient to secure the queen against the dangerous ambition and resentment of the house of guise forbes vol i p     jebb vol i p     keith append      elizabeths

inconsiderable fishertown in competition with the safety of her whole dominions spotswood p  0  and she still continued her preparations she concluded a treaty of mutual defense with the congregation

and the death of the queen regent who expired about this time in the castle of edinburgh a woman endowed with all the capacity which shone forth in her family but possessed of much more virtue and moderation than appeared in the conduct of the other branches of it the french who found it impossible to subsist for want of provisions and who saw that the english were continually reinforced by new numbers were obliged to capitulate  th july and the bishop of valence and count randan plenipotentiaries from france signed a treaty at edinburgh with cecil and dr wotton whom elizabeth had sent to edinburgh for that purpose settlement of scotland it was there stipulated that the french should all of them instantly evacuate scotland that the king and queen of france and scotland should thenceforth abstain from bearing the arms of england or assuming the title of that kingdom that farther satisfaction for the injury already done in that particular should be granted elizabeth and that commissioners should meet to settle this point or if they could not agree that the king of spain should be arbiter between the crowns besides these stipulations which regarded england some concessions were granted to the scotch which the plenipotentiaries in the name of the king and queen of france and scotland promised in the treaty with elizabeth to observe that an amnesty should be published for all past offenses that none but natives should be put into any office in scotland that the states should name twentyfour persons of whom the queen of scots should choose seven and the states five and

measures to prevent it making all the possible advantages of her situation she proceeded with celerity to a decision and was not diverted by any offers negotiations or remonstrances of the french court she stopped not till she had brought the matter to a final issue and had converted that very power to which her enemies trusted for her destruction into her firmest support and security by exacting no improper conditions from the scotch insurgents even during their greatest distress she established an entire confidence with them and having cemented the union by all the ties of gratitude interest and religion she now possessed an influence over them above what remained even with their native sovereign the regard which she acquired by this dextrous and spirited conduct gave her every

of the scotch reformers tended still more to cement their union with england being entirely masters of the kingdom they made no farther ceremony or scruple in fully effecting their purpose in the treaty of edinburgh it had been agreed that a parliament or convention should soon be assembled and the leaders of the congregation not waiting till the queen of scots should ratify that treaty thought themselves fully entitled without the sovereigns authority immediately to summon a parliament the reformers presented a petition to this assembly where they are not contented with desiring the establishment of their doctrine they also apply for the punishment of the catholics whom they call vassals to the roman harlot and they assert that amongst all the rabble of the clergy such is their expression there is not one lawful minister but that they are all of them thieves and murderers yea rebels and traitors to civil authority and therefore unworthy to be suffered in any reformed commonwealth knox p          the parliament seem to have been actuated by the same spirit of rage and persecution after ratifying a confession of faith agreeable to the new doctrines they passed a statute against the mass and not only abolished it in all the churches but enacted that whoever any where either officiated in it or was present at it should be chastised for the first offense with confiscation of goods and corporal punishment at the discretion of the magistrate for the second with banishment and for the third with loss of life ibid p      a law was also voted for abolishing the papal jurisdiction in scotland the presbyterian form of discipline was settled leaving only at first some shadow of authority to certain ecclesiastics whom they called superintendants the prelates of the ancient faith appeared in order to complain of great injustice committed on them by the invasion of their property but the parliament took no notice of them till at last these ecclesiastics tired with fruitless attendance departed the town they were then cited to appear and as no body presented themselves it was voted by the parliament that the ecclesiastics were entirely satisfied and found no reason of complaint  sir james sandilands prior of st john was sent over to france to obtain the ratification of these acts but was very ill received by the queen who absolutely denied the validity of a parliament summoned without the royal consent and she refused her sanction to these statutes but the protestants gave themselves little concern about their queens refusal they immediately put the statutes in execution they abolished the mass they settled their ministers they committed every where furious devastations on the monasteries and even on the churches which they thought to be profaned by idolatry and esteeming the property of the clergy lawful prey they took possession without ceremony of the far greater part of the ecclesiastical revenues their new preachers who had authority sufficient to incite them to war and insurrection could not restrain their rapacity and fanaticism concurring with avarice an incurable blow was given to the papal authority in that country the protestant nobility and gentry united by the consciousness of such unpardonable guilt alarmed for their new possessions well acquainted with the imperious character of the house of guise saw no safety for themselves but in the protection of england and they dispatched morton glencarne and ledington to express their sincere gratitude to the queen for her past favors and to represent to her the necessity of continuing them  french affairs elizabeth had equal reason to maintain an union with the scotch protestants and soon found that the house of guise notwithstanding their past disappointments had not laid aside the design of contesting her title and subverting her authority francis and mary whose councils were wholly directed by them refused to ratify the treaty of edinburgh and showed no disposition to give her any satisfaction for that mortal injury and affront which they had put upon her  so openly assuming the title and arms of england she was sensible of the danger attending such pretensions and it was with pleasure she heard of the violent factions which prevailed in the french government and of the opposition which had arisen against the measures of the duke of guile that ambitious prince supported by his four brothers the cardinal of lorraine the duke of aumale the marquis of elbeuf and the grand prior men no less ambitions than himself had engrossed all the authority of the crown and as he was possessed of every quality which could command the esteem or seduce the affections of men there appeared no end of this acquisitions and pretensions the constable montmorency who had long balanced his credit was deprived of all power the princes of the blood the king of navarre and his brother the prince of conde were entirely excluded from offices and favor the queen mother herself catherine de medicis found her influence every day declining and as francis a young prince infirm both in mind and body was wholly governed by his spouse who knew no law but the pleasure of her uncles men despaired of ever obtaining freedom from the dominion of that aspiring family it was the contests of religion which first inspired the french with courage openly to oppose their exorbitant authority  the theological disputes first started in the north of germany and next in switzerland countries at that time wholly illiterate had long ago penetrated into france and as they were assisted by the general discontents against the court and church of rome and by the zealous spirit of the age the proselytes to the new religion were secretly increasing in every province henry the second in imitation of his father francis had opposed the progress of the reformers and though a prince addicted to pleasure and society he was transported by a vehemence as well as bigotry which had little place in his predecessors conduct rigorous punishments had been inflicted on the most eminent of the protestant party and a point of honor seemed to have arisen whether the one sect could exercise or the other suffer most barbarity the death of henry put some stop to the persecutions and the people who had admired the constancy of the new preachers now heard with favor and prepossession their arguments and doctrines but the cardinal of lorraine as well as his brother who were possessed of the legal authority thought it their interest to support the established religion and when they revived the exercise of the penal statutes they necessarily engaged the malecontent princes and nobles in the protection of the new religion the king of navarre a man of mild dispositions but of a weak character and the prince of conde who possessed many heroic qualities having declared themselves in favor of the protestants that sect acquired new force from their countenance and the admiral de coligni with his brother andelot no longer scrupled to declare themselves openly of their communion the integrity of the admiral who was believed sincere in his prosession and his high renown both for valor and conduct for the arts of peace as well as of war gave credit to the resormers and after a frustrated attempt of the malcontents to seize the kings person at amboise of which elizabeth had probably some intelligence forbes vol i p     throemorton about this time unwilling to entrust to letters the great secrets committed to him obtained leave under some pretext to come over to london  every place was full of distraction and matters hastened to an extremity between the parties but the house of guise though these factions had obliged them to remit their efforts in scotland and had been one chief cause of elizabeths success were determined not to relinquish their authority in france or yield to the violence of their antagonists   december they found an opportunity to seize the king of navarre and the prince of conde they threw the former into prison they obtained a sentence of death against the latter  elizabeth was not dissatisfied to learn that her avowed enemies had met with so severe a check and she was determined to make advantage of it against the queen of scots whom she still regarded as a dangerous rival she saw herself freed from the perils attending an union of scotland with france and was pleased to find that so powerful a prince as the french monarch was no longer a pretender to her crown and kingdoms but she considered on the other hand that the english catholics who were very numerous and who were generally prejudiced in favor of marys title would now adhere to that princess with more zealous attachment when they saw that her succession no longer endangered the liberties of the kingdom and was rather attended with the advantages of producing an entire union with scotland she gave orders therefore to her ambassador throcmorton a very vigilant and able minister to renew his applications to the queen of scots and to require her ratification of the treaty of edinburgh but though mary had desisted after her husbands death from bearing the arms and title of queen of england she still declined gratifying elizabeth in this momentous article and hearkening too much to the ambitious suggestions of her uncles she refused to make any formal renunciation of her pretensions  meanwhile the queen mother of france who imputed to mary all the mortifications which she had met with during franciss lifetime took care to retaliate on her by like injuries and the queen of scots who found her abode in france disagreeable began to think of returning into her native country lord james who had been sent in deputation from the states to invite her over seconded this intention and she applied to elizabeth by doisel for liberty to pass through england goodall vol i p      but she received for answer that till she had given satisfaction by ratifying the treaty of edinburgh she could expect no favor from a person whom she had so much injured this denial excited her resentment and she made no scruple of expressing her sentiments to throcmorton when he reiterated his applications to gratify his mistress in a demand which he represented as so reasonable having cleared the room of all her attendants she said to him how weak i may prove or how far a womans frailty may transport me i cannot tell however i have no mind to have so many witnesses of my infirmity as your mistress had at her audience of my ambassador doisel there is nothing disturbs me so much as the having asked with so much importunity a favor which it was of no consequence for me to obtain i can with gods leave return to my own country without her leave as i came to france in spite of all the opposition of her brother king edward neither do i want friends both able and willing to conduct me home as they have brought me hither though i was desirous rather to make an experiment of her friendship than of the assistance of any other person i have often heard you say that a good correspondence between her and myself would conduce much to the security and happiness of both our kingdoms but were she well convinced of this truth she had hardly denied me so small a request but perhaps she bears a better inclination to my rebellious subjects than to me their sovereign her equal in royal dignity her near relation and the undoubted heir of her kingdoms besides her friendship i ask nothing at her hands i neither trouble her nor concern myself in the affairs of her kingdom not that i am ignorant that there are now in england a great many malcontents who are no friends to the present establishment she is pleased to upbraid me as a person little experienced in the world i freely own it but age will cure that defect however i am old enough to acquit myself honestly and courteously to my friends and relations and to encourage no reports of her which would misbecome a queen and her kinswoman i would also say by her leave that i am a queen as well as she and not altogether friendless and perhaps i have as great a soul too so that methinks we should be upon a level in our treatment of each other as soon as i have consulted the states of my kingdom i shall be ready to give a reasonable answer and i am the more intent on my journey that i may be able to make the quicker dispatch in this affair but she it seems intends to stop my journey so that either she will not let me give her satisfaction or is resolved not to be satisfied perhaps on purpose to keep up the disagreement betwixt us she has often reproached me with my being young and i must be very young indeed and as ill advised to treat of matters of such great concern and importance without the advice of my parliament i have not been wanting in any friendly offices to her but she disbelieves or overlooks them i could heartily wish that i was as near allied to her in affection as in blood for that indeed would be a most valuable alliance caballa p     spotswood p       such a spirited reply notwithstanding the obliging terms interspersed in it was but ill fitted to conciliate friendship between these rival princesses or cure those mutual jealousies which had already taken place elizabeth equipped a fleet under pretense of pursuing pirates but probably with an intention of intercepting the queen of scots in her return homewards   th august arrival of mary in scotland mary embarked at calais and passing the english fleet in a fog arrived safely at leith attended by her three uncles the duke of aumale the grand prior and the marquess of elbeuf together with the marquess of damville and other french courtiers this change of abode and situation was very little agreeable to that princess besides the natural prepossessions in favor of a country in which she had been educated from her earliest infancy and where she had borne so high a rank she could not forbear regreting her departure from among that people so celebrated for their humane and sociable disposition and their respectful attachment to their sovereign and reflecting on the disparity of the scene which lay before her it is said that after she was embarked at calais she kept her eyes fixed on the coast of france and never turned them from that beloved object till darkness fell and intercepted it from her view she then ordered a couch to be spread for her under the open air and charged the pilot that if in the morning the land was still in sight he should awake her and afford her one parting view of that country in which all her affections were centered the weather proved very calm so that the ship made little way in the nightime and mary had once more an opportunity of seeing the french coast she sat up on her couch and still looking toward the land often repeated these words farewell france farewell i shall never see thee more keith p     jebb vol    p      the first aspect however of things in scotland was more favorable if not to her pleasure and happiness at least to her repose and security than she had reason to apprehend no sooner did the french galleys appear off leith than people of all ranks who had long expected their arrival flocked toward the shore with an earnest impatience to behold and receive their young sovereign some were led by duty some by interest some by curiosity and all combined to express their attachment to her and to insinuate themselves into her confidence during the commencement of her administration she had now reached the nineteenth year of her age and the bloom of her youth and amiable beauty of her person were farther recommended by the affability of her address the politeness of her manners and the elegance of her genius well accomplished in all the superficial but engaging graces of a court she afforded when better known still more promising indications of her character and men prognosticated both humanity from her soft and obliging deportment and penetration from her taste in all the refined arts of music eloquence and poetry buchan lib xvii c   spotswood p         keith p   0 thuan lib xxix c   and as the scotch had long been deprived of the presence of their sovereign whom they once despaired ever more to behold among them her arrival seemed to give universal satisfaction and nothing appeared about the court but symptoms of affection joy and festivity  the first measures which mary embraced confirmed all the prepossessions which had been entertained in her favor she followed the advice which she had received in france from doisel and the bishop of amiens as well as her uncles and gave her confidence entirely to the leaders of the reformed party who had greatest influence on the people and who she found were alone able to support her government her brother lord james whom she soon after created earl of murray obtained the chief authority and after him lidington secretary of state a man of great sagacity had a principal share in her confidence by the vigor of these mens measures she endeavored to restore order and police into the country divided by public factions and private feuds and that fierce and intractable people unacquainted with laws and obedience seemed for a time to submit peaceably to her gentle and prudent administration  bigotry of the scotch reformers but there was one circumstance which blasted all these promising appearances and bereaved mary of that general favor which her manners and conduct gave her just reason to expect she was still a papist and though she published soon after her arrival a proclamation requiring every one to submit to the established religion the preachers and their adherents could neither be reconciled to a person polluted with so great an abomination nor lay aside their jealousies of her future conduct it was with great difficulty she could obtain permission for mass in her own chapel and had not the people apprehended that if she had here met with a refusal she would instantly have returned to france the zealots never would have granted her even that small indulgence the cry was shall that idol be suffered again to be erected within the realm it was asserted in the pulpit that one mass was more terrible than ten thousand armed men landed to invade the kingdom knox p      lord lindesey and the gentlemen of fife exclaimed that the idolater should die the death such was their expression one that carried tapers for the ceremony of that worship was attacked and insulted in the court of the palace and if the lord james and some popular leaders had not interposed the most dangerous uproar was justly apprehended from the ungoverned fury of the multitude ibid p             sposwood p      the usual prayers in the churches were to this purpose that god would turn her heart which was obstinate against him and his truth or if his holy will be otherwise that he would strengthen the hearts and hands of the elect stoutly to oppose the rage of all tyrants kith p     nay it was openly called in question whether that princess being an idolater was entitled to any authority even in civil matters ibid p  0    the helpless queen was every moment exposed to contumely which she bore with benignity and patience soon after her arrival she dined in the castle of edinburgh and it was there contrived that a boy of six years should be let down from the roof and should present her with a bible a psalter and the keys of the castle lest she should be at a loss to understand this insult on her as a papist the whole decorations expressed the burning of corah dathan and abiram and other punishments inflicted by god against idolatry ibid p      the town council of edinburgh had the assurance from their own authority to issue forth a proclamation banishing from their district all the wicked rabble of antichrist the pope such as priests monks friars together with adulterers and fornicators ibid p    and because the privy council suspended the magistrates for their insolence the passionate historians kno p     buchan b xvii c  0 haynes vol   p   of that age have inferred that the queen was engaged by a sympathy of manners to take adulterers and fornicators under her protection it appears probable that the magistrates were afterward reinstated in their office and that their proclamation was confirmed keith p  0    but all the insolence of the people was nothing in comparison of that which was exercised by the clergy and the preachers and they took a pride in vilifying even to her face this amiable princess the assembly of the church  amed an address in which after telling her that her mass was a bastard service of god the fountain of all impiety and the source of every evil which abounded in the realm they discovered their expectations that she would ere this time have preferred truth to her own preconceived opinion and have renounced her religion which they assured her was nothing but abomination and vanity they said that the present abuses of government were so enormous that if a speedy remedy was not provided god would not fail in his anger to strike the head and the tail the disobedient prince and sinful people they required that severe punishment should be inflicted on adulterers and fornicators and they concluded with demanding for themselves some addition both of power and property knox p           the ringleader in all these insults on majesty was john knox who possessed an uncontrouled authority in the church and even in the civil affairs of the nation and who triumphed in the contumelious usage of his sovereign his usual appellation for the queen was jezabel and though she endeavored by the most gracious condescension to win his favor all her insinuations could gain nothing on his obdurate heart she promised him access to her whenever he demanded it and she even desired him if he found her blameable in any thing to reprehend her freely in private rather than vilify her in the pulpit before all the people but he plainly told her that he had a public ministry entrusted to him that if she would come to church she should there hear the gospel of truth and that it was not his business to apply to every individual nor had he leisure for that occupation ibid p   0  the political principles of the man which he communicated to his brethren were as full of sedition as his theological were of rage and bigotry though he once condescended so far as to tell the queen that he would submit to her in the same manner that paul did to nero ibid p      he remained not long in this dutiful strain he said to her that samuel feared not to slay agag the sat and delicate king of amalek whom king saul had saved neither spared elias jezabels false prophets and baals priests though king ahab was present phineas added he was no magistrate and yet feared he not to strike cosbie and zimri in the very act of silthy fornication and so madam your grace may see that others than chief magistrates may lawfully inflict punishment on such crimes as are condemned by the law of god ibid p      knox had formerly during the reign of mary of england wrote a book against female succession to the crown the title of it is the first blast of the trumpet against the monstrous regimen of women he was too proud either to recant the tenets of this book or even to apologize for them and his conduct showed that he thought no more civility than loyalty was due to any of the female sex  the whole life of mary from the demeanor of these men was filled with bitterness and sorrow this rustic apostle scruples not in his history to inform us that he once treated her with such severity that she lost all command of her temper and dissolved into tears before him yet so far from being moved with youth and beauty and royal dignity reduced to that condition he persevered in his insolent reproofs and when he relates this incident he even discovers a visible pride and satisfaction in his own conduct nox p         the pulpits had become nothing but scenes of railing against the vices of the court among which was always noted as the principal feasting finery dancing balls and whoredom their necessary attendant ibid p      some ornaments which the ladies at that time wore upon their petticoats excited mightily the indignation of the preachers and they affirmed that such vanity would provoke gods vengeance not only against these foolish women but against the whole realm ibid p   0   mary whose age and condition and education invited her to liberty and cheerfulness was curbed in every amusement by the absurd severity of these reformers and she found each moment reason to regret her leaving that country from whose manners she had in her early youth received the first impressions ibid p    her two uncles the duke of aumale and the grand prior with the other french nobility soon took their leave of her the marquess of elbeuf remained some time longer but after his departure she was left alone to the society of her own subjects men at that time unacquainted with the pleasures of conversation ignorant of arts and civility and corrupted beyond their usual rusticity by a dismal fanaticism which rendered them incapable of all humanity or improvement though she had made no attempt to restore the ancient religion her popery was a sufficient crime though her behavior was hitherto irreproachable and her manners sweet and engaging her gaiety and ease were interpreted as signs of dissolute vanity and to the harsh and preposterous usage which this princess met with may in part be ascribed those errors of her subsequent conduct which seemed to be so little of a piece with the general tenor of her character  there happened to the marquess of elbeuf before his departure an adventure which though frivolous might enable him to give marys friends in france a very melancholy idea of her situation this nobleman with the earl of bothwel and some other young courtiers had been engaged after a debauch to pay a visit to a woman called alison craig who was known to be liberal of her avours and because they were denied entrance they broke the windows thrust open the door and committed some disorders in searching for the damsel it happened that the assembly of the church was sitting at that time and they immediately took the matter under their cognizance in conjunction with several of the nobility they presented an address to the queen which was introduced with this awful prelude to the queens majesty and to her secret and great council her graces faithful and obedient subjects the professors of christ jesuss holy evangil wish the spirit of righteous judgment the tenor of the petition was that the fear of god the duty which they owed her grace and the terrible threatenings denounced by god against every city or country where horrible crimes are openly committed compelled them to demand the severe punishment of such as had done what in them lay to kindle the wrath of god against the whole realm that the iniquity of which they complained was so heinous and so horrible that they would esteem themselves accomplices in it if they had been engaged by worldly fear or servile complaisance to pass it over in silence or bury it in oblivion that as they owed her grace obedience in the administration of justice so were they entitled to require of her in return the sharp and condign punishment of this enormity which they repeated it might draw down the vengeance of god on the whole kingdom and that they insisted on it to be her duty to lay aside all private affections toward the actors in this heinous crime and enormous villainy and without delay bring them to a trial and inflict the severest penalties upon them the queen gave a gracious reception to this peremptory address but because she probably thought that breaking the windows of a brothel merited not such severe reprehension she only replied that her uncle was a stranger and that he was attended with a young company but she should put such order to him and to all others that her subjects should henceforth have no reason to complain her passing over this incident so slightly was the source of great discontent and was regarded as a proof of the most profligate mans knox p  0  0   0  keith p  0   it is not to be omitted that alison craig the cause of all the uproar was known to entertain a commerce with the earl of arran who on account of his great zeal for the reformation was without scruple indulged in that enormity knox ibid   some of the populace of edinburgh broke into the queens chapel during her absence and committed some outrages for which two of them were indicted and it was intended to bring them to a trial knox wrote circular letters to the most considerable zealots of the party and charged them to appear in town and protect their brethren the holy sacraments he there said are abused by profane papists the mass has been said and in worshipping that idol the priests have omitted no ceremony not even the conjuring of their accursed water that had ever been practiced in the time of the greatest blindness these violent measures for opposing justice differed little from rebellion and knox was summoned before the council to answer for his offense the courage of this man was equal to his insolence he scrupled not to tell the queen that the pestilent papists who had enflamed her against these holy men were the sons of the devil and must therefore obey the directions of their father who had been a liar and a manslayer from the beginning the matter ended with the full acquital of knox knox p          randolf the english ambassador in scotland at this time had reason to write to cecil speaking of the scotch nation i think marvelously of the wisdom of god that gave this unruly inconstant and cumbersome people no more power nor substance for they would otherwise run wild keith p  0    we have related these circumstances at greater length than the necessity of our subject may seem to require but even trivial incidents which show the manners of the age are often more instructive as well as entertaining than the great transactions of wars and negotiations which are pretty similar in all periods and in all countries of the world  the reformed clergy in scotland had at that time a very natural reason for their ill humor viz the poverty or rather beggary to which they were reduced the nobility and gentry had at first laid their hands on all the property of the regular clergy without making any provision for the friars and nuns whom they turned out of all their possessions the secular clergy of the catholic communion though they lost all ecclesiastical jurisdiction still held some of the temporalities of their benefices and either became laymen themselves and converted them into perpetual property or made conveyance of them at low prices to the nobility who thus enriched themselves by the plunder of the church the new teachers had hitherto subsisted chiefly by the voluntary oblations of the faithful and in a poor country divided in religious sentiments this establishment was regarded as very scanty and very precarious repeated applications were made for a leal settlement to the preachers and though almost every thing in the kingdom was governed by their zeal and caprice it was with difficulty that their request was at last complied with the fanatical spirit which they indulged and then industry in decrying the principles and practices of the romish communion which placed such a merit in enriching the clergy proved now a very sensible obstacle to their acquisitions the boundaries of the royal power were during that age more uncertain in scotland than even in england and the privy council alone thought themselves entitled without a parliament to regulate this important matter they passed a vote knox p     keith p   0  by which they divided all the ecclesiastical benefices into twenty one parts they assigned fourteen to the ancient possessors of the remaining seven they granted three to the crown and if that was found to answer the public expenses they bestowed the overplus on the reformed ministers the queen was empowered to levy the whole seven and it was ordained that she should afterward pay to the clergy what should be judged to suffice for their maintenance the necessities of the crown the rapacity of the courtiers and the small affection which mary bore the protestant ecclesiastics rendered their revenues very contemptible as well as uncertain and the preachers finding that they could not rival the gentry nor even the middling rank of men in opulence and plenty were necessitated to betake themselves to other expedients for supporting their authority they affected a furious zeal for religion morose manners a vulgar and familiar and yet mysterious cant and though the liberality of subsequent princes put them afterward on a better footing with regard to revenue and thereby corrected in some degree these vicious habits it must be confessed that while many other advantages attend presbyterian government these inconveniences are not easily separated from the genius of that ecclesiastical polity  the queen of scots destitute of all force possessing a narrow revenue surrounded with a factious turbulent nobility a bigoted people and insolent ecclesiastics soon found that her only expedient for maintaining tranquillity was to preserve a good correspondence with jebb vol ii p     elizabeth who by former engagements and services had acquired such authority over all these ranks of men soon after her arrival in scotland secretary lidington was sent to london in order to pay her compliments to the queen and express her desire of friendship and a good correspondence and he received a commission from her as well as from the scotch nobility to demand as a means of cementing this friendship that mary should by act of parliament or by proclamation for the difference between these securities was not then esteemed very considerable be declared successor to the crown no request could be more unreasonable or made at a more improper juncture the queen replied that mary had once discovered her intention not to wait for the succession but had openly without ceremony or reserve assumed the title of queen of england and had pretended superior right to her throne and kingdom that though her ambassadors and those of her husband the french king had signed a treaty where they renounced that claim and promised satisfaction for so great an indignity she was so intoxicated with this imaginary right that she had rejected the most earnest solicitations and even as some endeavored to persuade her incurred some danger in crossing the seas rather than ratify that equitable treaty that her partisans every where had still the assurance to insist on her title and had presumed to talk of her own birth as spurious and illegitimate that while affairs were on this footing while a claim thus openly made so far from being openly renounced was only suspended till a more convenient opportunity it would in her be the most egregious imprudence to fortify the hands of a pretender to her crown by declaring her the successor that no expedient could be worse imagined for cementing friendship than such a declaration and kings were often sound to bear no good will to their successors even though their own children much more when the connection was so much less intimate and when such cause of disgust and jealousy had already been given and indeed was still centinued on the part of mary that though she was willing from the amity which she bore her kinswoman to ascribe her former pretensions to the advice of others by whose direction she was then governed her refusal to relinquish them could proceed only from her own prepossessions and were a proof that she still retained some dangerous project against her that it was the nature of all men to be disgusted with the present to entertain flattering views of futurity to think their services ill rewarded to expect a better recompense from the successor and she would esteem herself scarce half a sovereign over the english if they saw her declare her heir and arm her rival with authority against her own repose and safety that she knew the inconstant nature of the people she was acquainted with the present divisions in religion she was not ignorant that the same party which expected greatest favor during the reign of mary did also imagine that the title of that princess was superior to her own that for her part whatever claims were advanced she was determined to live and die queen of england and after her death it was the business of others to examine who had the best pretensions either by the laws or by right of blood to the succession that she hoped the queen of scotss claim would then be found preserable and considering the injury which she herself had received it was sufficient indulgence if she premised in the mean time to do nothing which might in any respect weaken or invalidate that claim and that mary if her title was really superior a point which for her own part she had never enquired into possessed all advantages above her rivals who destitute both of present power and of all support by friends would only expose themselves to inevitable ruin by advancing any weak or even doubtful pretensions buchanan lib xvii c      camden p    these views of the queen were so prudent and judicious that there was no likelihood of her ever departing from them but that she might put the matter to a fuller proof she offered to explain the words of the treaty of edinburgh so as to leave no suspicion of their excluding marys right of succession spotswood p      and in this form she again required her to ratify that treaty matters at last came to this issue that mary agreed to the proposal and offered to renounce all present pretensions to the crown of england provided elizabeth would agree to declare her the successor haynes vol i p      but such was the jealous character of this latter princess that she never would consent to strengthen the interest and authority of any claimant by fixing the succession much less would she make this concession in favor of a rival queen who possessed such plausible pretensions for the present and who though she might verbally resign them could easily resume her title on the first opportunity marys demand however bore so specious an appearance of equity and justice that elizabeth sensible that reason would be deemed to lie entirely on that side made no more mention of the matter and though no farther concessions were made by either princess they put on all the appearances of a cordial reconcilement and friendship with each other wise government of elizabeth the queen observed that even without her interposal mary was sufficiently depressed by the mutinous disposition of her own subjects and instead of giving scotland for the present any unquietude or disturbance she employed herself much more usefully and laudably in regulating the affairs of her own kingdom and promoting the happiness of her people she made some progress in paying those great debts which lay upon the crown she regulated the coin which had been extremely debased by her predecessors she furnished her arsenals with great quantities of arms from germany and other places engaged her gentry and nobility to imitate her example in this particular introduced into the kingdom the art of making gunpowder and brass cannon fortified her frontiers on the side of scotland made frequent reviews of the militia encouraged agriculture by allowing a free exportation of corn promoted trade and navigation and so much increased the shipping of her kingdom both by building vessels of force herself and suggesting like undertakings to the merchants that she was justly styled the restorer of naval glory and the queen of the northern seas camden p     strype vol i p   the natural frugality of her temper so far from disqualifying her for these great enterprises only enabled her to execute them with greater certainty and success and all the world saw in her conduct the happy effects of a vigorous perseverance in judicious and well conducted projects  it is easy to imagine that so great a princess who enjoyed such felicity and renown would receive proposals of marriage from every one who had any likelihood of succeeding and though she had made some public declarations in favor of a single life few believed that she would persevere forever in that resolution the archduke charles second son to the emperor haynes vol i p   as well as casimir son to the elector palatine made applications to her and as this latter prince made profession of the reformed religion he thought himself on this account better entitled to succeed in his addresses eric king of sweden and adolph duke of holstein were encouraged by the same views to become suitors and the earl of arran heir to the crown of scotland was by the states of that kingdom recommended to her as a suitable marriage even some of her own subjects though they did not openly declare their pretensions entertained hopes of success the earl of arundel a person declining in years but descended from a very ancient and noble family as well as possessed of great riches flattered himself with this prospect as did also sir william pickering a man much esteemed for his personal merit but the person most likely to succeed was a younger son of the late duke of northumberland the lord robert dudley who by means of his exterior qualities joined to address and flattery had become in a manner her declared favorite and had great influence in all her councils the less worthy he appeared of this distinction the more was his great favor ascribed to some violent affection which could thus seduce the judgment of this penetrating princess and men long expected that he would obtain the preference above so many princes and monarchs but the queen gave all these suitors a gentle refusal which still encouraged their pursuit and she thought that she should the better attach them to her interests if they were still allowed to entertain hopes of succeeding in their pretensions it is also probable that this policy was not entirely free from a mixture of female coquetry and that though she was determined in her own mind never to share her power with any man she was not displeased with the courtship solicitation and professions of love which the desire of acquiring so valuable a prize procured her from all quarters  what is most singular in the conduct and character of elizabeth is that though she was determined never to have any heir of her own body she was not only extremely averse to six any successor to the crown but seems also to have resolved as far as lay in her power that no one who had pretensions to the succession should ever have any heirs or successors after the exclusion given by the will of henry viii to the posterity of margaret queen of scotland the right to the crown devolved on the house of suffolk and the lady catherine gray younger sister to the lady jane was now the heir of that family this lady had been married to the lord herbert son to the earl of pembroke but having been divorced from that nobleman she had entered into a private contract with the earl of hartford son to the protector and her husband soon after consummation traveled into france in a little time she appeared to be pregnant which so enraged elizabeth that she threw her into the tower and summoned him to appear in order to answer for his misdemeanor he made no scruple to acknowledge the marriage which though concluded without the queens consent was entirely suitable to both parties and for this offense he was also committed to the tower elizabeths severity stopped not here she issued a commission to enquire into the matter and as hartford could not within the time limited prove the nuptials by witnesses their commerce was declared unlawful and their posterity illegitimate they were still continued in custody but by bribing their keepers they found means to have farther intercourse and another child appeared to be the fruit of their commerce this was a fresh source of vexation to the queen who made a fine of fifteen thousand pounds be set on hartford by the star chamber and ordered his confinement to be thenceforth still more rigid and severe he lay in this condition for nine years till the death of his wife by freeing elizabeth from all fears procured him his liberty haynes vol i p             camden p     heylin p      this extreme severity must be accounted for either by the unrelenting jealousy of the queen who was afraid that any pretender to the succession would acquire credit by having issue or by her malignity which with all her great qualities made one ingredient in her character and which led her to envy in others those natural pleasures of love and posterity of which her own ambition and desire of dominion made her renounce all prospect for herself  there happened about this time some other events in the royal family where the queens conduct was more laudable arthur pole and his brother nephews to the late cardinal and descended from the duke of clarence brother to edward the fourth together with anthony

method except the most entire compliance or most obstinate resistance to escape or elude the severity of his vengeance  during that extreme animosity which prevailed between the adherents of the opposite religions the civil magistrate who found it difficult if not impossible for the same laws to govern such enraged adversaries was naturally led by specious rules of prudence in embracing one party to declare war against the other and to exterminate by fire and sword those bigots who from abhorrence of his religion had proceeded to an opposition of his power and to an hatred of his person if any prince possessed such enlarged views as to foresee that a mutual toleration would in time abate the fury of religious prejudices he yet met with difficulties in reducing this principle to practice and might deem the malady too violent to await a remedy which though certain must necessarily be slow in its operations but philip though a profound hypocrite and extremely governed by selfinterest seems also to have been himself actuated by an imperious bigotry and as he employed great reflection in all his conduct he could easily palliate the gratification of his natural temper under the color of wisdom and find in this system no less advantage to his foreign than his domestic politics by placing himself at the head of the catholic party he converted the zealots of the ancient faith into partisans of the spanish greatness and by employing the powerful allurement of religion he seduced every where the subjects from that allegiance which they owed their native sovereign  the course of events guiding and concurring with choice had placed elizabeth in a situation diametrically opposite and had raised her to be the glory the bulwark and the support of the numerous though still persecuted protestants throughout all europe more moderate in her temper than philip she found with pleasure that the principles of her sect required not such extreme severity in her domestic government as was exercised by that monarch and having no object but selfpreservation she united her interests in all foreign negociations with those who were every where struggling under oppression and guarding themselves against ruin and extermination the more virtuous sovereign was thus happily thrown into the more favorable cause and fortune in this instance concurred with policy and nature  during the lifetime of henry the second and his successor the force of these principles was somewhat restrained though not altogether overcome by the motives of a superior interest and the dread of uniting england with the french monarchy engaged philip to maintain a good correspondence with elizabeth yet even during this period he rejected the garter which she sent him he refused to ratify the ancient league between the house of burgundy and england digg complete ambassador p     haynes p     strype vol   he furnished ships to transport the french forces into scotland he endeavored to intercept the earl of arran who was hastening to join the malcontents in that country and the queens wisest ministers still regarded his friendship as hollow and precarious haynes vol i p   0              but no sooner did the death of francis the second put an and to philips apprehensions with regard to marys succession than his animos against elizabeth began more openly to appear and the interests of spain and england were found opposite in every negotiation and transaction  the two great monarchies of the continent france and spain being possessed of nearly equal force were naturally antagonists and england from its power and situation was entitled to support its own dignity as well as tranquilly by holding the balance between them whatever incident therefore tended too much to depress any one of these rival powers as it left the other without control might be deemed contrary to the interest of england yet so much were these great maxims of policy overruled during that age by the disputes of theology that philip found an advantage in supporting the established government and religion of france and elizabeth in protecting faction and innovation  civil wars of france the queenregent of france when reinstated in authority by the death of her son francis had formed a plan of administration more subtle than judicious and ballancing the catholics with the hugonots the duke of guise with the prince of conde she endeavored to render herself necessary to both and to establish her own dominion on their constrained obedience davila lib ii  but the equal counterpoise of power which among foreign nations is the source of tranquillity proves always the ground of quarrel between domestic factions and if the animosity of religion concur with the frequent occasions which present themselves of mutual injury it is impossible during any time to preserve a firm concord in so delicate a situation the constable montmorency moved by concern for the ancient faith joined himself to the duke of guise the king of navarre from his inconstant temper and his jealousy of the superior genius of his brother embraced the same party and catherine finding herself depressed by this combination had recourse to conde and the hugonots who gladly embraced the opportunity of fortifying themselves by her countenance and protection ibid lib iii  an edict had been published granting a toleration to the protestants but the interested violence of the duke of guise covered with the pretense of religious zeal broke through this agreement and the two parties after the fallacious tranquillity of a moment renewed their mutual insults and injuries conde coligni andelot assembled their friends and flew to arms guise and montmorency got possession of the kings person and constrained the queenregent to embrace their party fourteen armies were levied and put in action in different places of france father paul lib vii  each province each city each family was agitated with intestine rage and animosity the father was divided against the son the brother against the brother and women themselves sacrificing their humanity as well as their timidity to the religious fury distinguished themselves by acts of ferocity and valor ibid  wherever the hugonots prevailed the images were broke the altars pillaged the churches demolished the monasteries consumed with fire where success attended the catholics they burned the bibles rebaptized the infants constrained married persons to pass anew through the ceremony and plunder desolation and bloodshed attended equally the triumph of both parties the parliament of paris itself the seat of law and justice instead of employing its authority to compose these fatal quarrels published an edict by which it put the sword into the hands of the enraged multitude and empowered the catholics every where to massacre the hugonots father paul lib vii haynes p      and it was during this period when men began to be somewhat enlightened and in this nation renowned for polished manners that the theological rage which had long been boiling in mens veins seems to have attained its last stage of virulence and ferocity  philip who was jealous of the progress which the hugonots made in france and who dreaded that the contagion would spread into the low country provinces had formed a secret alliance with the princes of guise and had entered into a mutual concert for the protection of the ancient faith and the suppression of heresy he now sent six thousand men with some supply of money to reinforce the catholic party and the prince of conde finding himself unequal to so great a combination countenanced by the regal authority was obliged to dispatch the vidame of chartres and briguemaut to london in order to crave the assistance and protection of elizabeth havre de grace put in possession of the english most of the province of normandy was possessed by the hugonots and conde offered to put havre de grace into the hands of the english on condition that together with three thousand men for the garrison of that place the queen should likewise send over three thousand to defend dieppe and rouen and should furnish the prince with a supply of a hundred thousand crowns  vol ii p    elizabeth besides the general and essential interest of supporting the protestants and opposing the rapid progress of her enemy the duke of guise had other motives which engaged her to accept this proposal  0th september when she concluded the peace at cateau cambresis she had good reason to foresee that france never would voluntarily fulfill the article with regard to the restitution of calais and many subsequent incidents had tended to confirm this suspicion considerable sums of money had been laid out on the fortifications long leases had been granted of the lands and many inhabitants had been encouraged to build and settle there by assurances that calais should never be restored to the english  p        the queen therefore very wisely concluded that could she get possession of havre a place which commanded the mouth of the seine and was of much greater importance than calais she would easily constrain the french to execute the treaty and would have the glory of restoring to the crown that ancient possession which was so much the favorite of the nation  no measure could be more generally odious in france than the conclusion of this treaty with elizabeth men were naturally led to compare the conduct of guise who had finally chased the english from france and had barred these dangerous and destructive enemies from all access into it with the treasonable politics of conde who had again granted them an entry into the heart of the kingdom the prince had the more reason to repent of this measure that he reaped not from it all the advantage which he expected three thousand english immediately took possession of havre and dieppe under the command of sir edward poinings but the latter place was found so little capable of being defended that it was immediately abandoned forbes vol ii p      the siege of rouen was already formed by the catholics the command of the king of navarre and the constable montmorency and it was with difficulty that poinings could throw a small reinforcement into the place though these english troops behaved with great gallantry ibid p      and the king of navarre was mortally wounded during the siege the catholics still continued the attack of the place and carrying it at last by assault put the whole garrison to the sword the earl of warwic eldest son to the late duke of northumberland arrived soon after at havre with another body of three thousand english and took on him the command of the place  it was expected that the french catholics flushed with their success at rouen would immediately have formed the siege of havre which was not as yet in any condition of defense but the intestine disorders of the kingdom soon diverted their attention to another enterprise andelot seconded by the negociations of elizabeth had levied a considerable body of protestants in germany and having arrived at orleans the seat of the hugonots power he enabled the prince of conde and the admiral to take the field and oppose the progress of their enemies after threatening paris during some time they took their march toward normandy with a view of engaging the english to act in conjunction with them and of fortifying themselves with the farther assistance which they expected from the zeal and vigor of elizabeth ibid p   0 davila llb iii  the catholics commanded by the constable and under him by the duke of guise followed on their rear and overtaking them at dreux obliged them to give battle   th of december the field was fought with great obstinacy on both sides and the action was distinguished by this signal event that conde and montmorency the commanders of the opposite armies remained both of them prisoners in the hands of their enemies the appearances of victory remained with guise but the admiral whose fate it ever was to be defeated and still to rise more terrible after his misfortunes collected the remains of the army and inspiring his own unconquerable courage and constancy into every breast kept them in a body and subdued some of the most considerable places in normandy elizabeth the better to support his cause sent him a new supply of a hundred thousand crowns and offered if he could find merchants to lend him the money to give her bond for another hundred thousand forbes vol ii p              january a parliament the expenses incurred by assisting the french hugonots had emptied the queens exchequer notwithstanding her extreme frugality and in order to obtain supply she found herself under a necessity of summoning a parliament an expedient to which she never voluntarily had recourse a little before the meeting of this assembly she had fallen into a dangerous illness the smallpox and as her life during some time was despaired of the people became the more sensible of the perilous condition in which they were placed on account of the uncertainty which in case of her decease attended the succession of the crown the partisans of the queen of scots and those of the house of suffolk already divided the nation into two factions and every one foresaw that though it might be possible at present to determine the controversy by law yet if the throne was vacant nothing but the sword would be able to fix a successor the commons therefore on the very opening of the session voted an address to the queen in which after enumerating the dangers attending a broken and doubtful succession and mentioning the evils which their fathers had experienced from the contending titles of york and lancaster they entreated the queen to put an end to their apprehensions by choosing some husband whom they promised whoever he was gratefully to receive and faithfully to serve honor and obey or if she had entertained any reluctance to the married state they desired that the lawful successor might be named or at least appointed by act of parliament they remarked that during all the reigns which had passed since the conquest the nation had never before been so unhappy as not to know the person who in case of the sovereigns death was legally entitled to the succession and they observed that the certain and fixed order which took place in the inheritance of the french monarchy was one chief source of the usual tranquillity as well as of the happiness of that kingdom sir simon dewes journ p      this subject though extremely interesting to the nation was very little agreeable to the queen and she was sensible that great difficulties would attend every decision a declaration in favor of the queen of scots would form a settlement perfectly legal because that princess was commonly allowed to possess the right of blood and the exclusion given by henrys will deriving its weight chiefly from an act of parliament would lose all authority whenever the queen and parliament had made a new settlement and restored the scottish line to their place in the succession but she dreaded the giving encouragement to the catholics her secret enemies by this declaration she was sensible that every heir was in some degree a rival much more one who possessed a claim for the present possession of the crown and who had already advanced in a very open manner these dangerous pretensions the great power of mary both from the favor of the catholic princes and her connections with the house of guise not to mention the force and situation of scotland was well known to her and she saw no security that that princess if fortified by a sure prospect of succession would not again revive claims which she could never yet be prevailed on formally to relinquish on the other hand the title of the house of suffolk was supported only by the more zealous protestants and it was very doubtful whether even a parliamentary declaration in its favor would bestow on it such validity as to give satisfaction to the people the republican part of the constitution had not as yet acquired such an ascendant as to control in any degree the ideas of hereditary right and as the legality of henrys will was still disputed though founded on the utmost authority which a parliament could bestow who could be assured that a more recent act would be acknowleged to have any greater force or validity in the frequent revolutions which had of late taken place the right of blood had still prevailed over religious prejudices and the nation had ever showed itself disposed rather to change its faith than the order of succession even many protestants declared themselves in favor of marys claim of inheritance keith p   and nothing would endanger more general disgust than to see the queen openly and without reserve take party against it that princess also finding herself injured in so sensible a point would thenceforth act as a declared enemy and uniting together her foreign and domestic friends the partisans of her present title and of her eventual succession would soon bring matters to extremity against the public establishment the queen therefore weighing all these inconveniences which were great and urgent was determined to keep both parties in awe by maintaining still an ambiguous conduct and she chose rather that the people should run the hazard of contingent events than that herself should visibly endanger her throne by employing expedients which at best did not give entire security to the nation she made therefore an evasive answer to the applications of the commons and when the house at the end of the sessions desired by the mouth of their speaker farther satisfaction on that head she could not be prevailed on to make her reply more explicit she only told them contrary to her declarations in the beginning of her reign that she had fixed no absolute resolution against marriage and she added that the difficulties with which the question of the succession was attended were so great that she would be contented for their sake to remain some time longer in this vale of misery and never would depart this life with satisfaction till she had laid some solid foundation for their future security sir simon dewess journal p      the most remarkable law passed this session was that which bore the title of assurance of the queens royal power over all states and subjects within her dominions  eliz c    by this act the asserting twice by writing word or deed the popes authority was subjected to the penalties of treason all persons in holy orders were bound to take the oath of supremacy as also all who were advanced to any degrees either in the universities or in common law all schoolmasters officers in court or members of parliament and the penalty of their second refusal was treason the first offense in both cases was punished by banishment and forfeiture this rigorous statute which involved a real though not general persecution and of the worst kind too as it made a scrutiny into mens secret sentiments was not extended to any of the degree of a baron because it was not supposed that the queen could entertain any doubt with regard to the fidelity of persons possessed of such high dignity the lord montacute made vigorous opposition to this bill and asserted in favor of the catholics that they disputed not they preached not they disobeyed not the queen they caused no trouble nor tumults among the people strype vol i p   it is however probable that some suspicions of their secret conspiracies had made the queen and parliament increase their rigor against them though it is also more than probable that they were mistaken in the nature of the remedy  there was likewise another point where the parliament this session showed more the goodness of their intention than the soundness of their judgment they passed a law against fond and fantastical prophecies which had been observed to seduce the people into rebellion and disorder  eliz c     but at the same time they enacted a statute which was most likely to increase these and such like superstitions it was levelled against conjurations enchantments and witchcra ibid c   witchcraft and heresy are two crimes which always increase by punishment and never are so essectually suppressed as by being totally neglected after the parliament had granted the queen a supply of one subsidy and two fifteenths it was finished by a prorogation the convocation likewise voted the queen a subsidy of six shillings in the pound payable in three years  while the english parties exerted these calm efforts against each other in parliamentary votes and debates the french factions enflamed to the highest degree of animosity continued that cruel war which their intemperate zeal actuated by the ambition of their leaders had kindled in the kingdom the admiral was successful in reducing the towns of normandy which held for the king but he frequently complained that the numerous garrison of havre remained totally unactive and was not employed in any military operations against the common enemy the queen in taking possession of that place had published a manifesto forbes vol ii  in which she pretended that her concern for the french kings interest had engaged her in that measure and that her sole intention was to oppose her enemies of the house of guise who held their prince in captivity and employed his power to the destruction of his best and most faithful subjects it was chiefly her desire to preserve appearances joined to the great frugality of her temper which made her at this critical juncture keep her soldiers in garrison and restrain them from committing farther hostilities upon the enemy ibid p         the duke of guise meanwhile was aiming a mortal blow at the power of the hugonots and had commenced the siege of orleans which was commanded by andelot and where the constable was detained prisoner he had the prospect of speedy success in this undertaking when he was assassinated by poltrot a young gentleman whose zeal instigated as it is pretended though without any certain foundation by the admiral and beza a famous preacher led him to attempt that criminal enterprise the death of this gallant prince was a very sensible loss to the catholic party and though the cardinal of lorraine his brother still supported the interest of the family the danger of their progress appeared much less imminent both to queen elizabeth and to the french protestants the union therefore between these allies which had been cemented by their common fears began thenceforth to be less intimate and the leaders of the hugonots were persuaded to hearken to terms of accommodation conde and montmorency held conferences for settling the peace and as they were both of them impatient to relieve themselves from captivity they soon came to an agreement with regard to the conditions the character of the queenregent whose ends were always violent but who endeavored by subtilty and policy rather than force to attain them led her to embrace any plausible terms and in spite of the admirals protestations whose sagacity could easily discover the treachery of the court the articles of agreement were finally settled between the parties a toleration under some restrictions was anew granted to the protestants a general amnesty was published conde was reinstated in his offices and governments and after money was advanced for the payment of arrears due to the german troops they were dismissed the kingdom  by the agreement between elizabeth and the prince of conde it had been stipulated forbes vol ii p     that neither party should conclude peace without the consent of the other but this article was at present but little regarded by the leaders of the french protestants they only comprehended her so far in the treaty as to obtain a promise that on her relinquishing havre her charges and the money which she had advanced them should be repaid her by the king of france and that calais on the expiration of the term should be restored to her but she disdained to accept of these terms and thinking the possession of havre a much better pledge for the obtaining her purpose she sent warwic orders to prepare himself against an attack from the now united power of the french monarchy  the earl of warwic who commanded a garrison of six thousand men beside seven hundred pioniers had no sooner got possession of havre than he employed every means for putting it in a posture of defense ibid p      and after expelling the french from the town he encouraged his soldiers to make the most desperate defense against the enemy the constable commanded the french army the queenregent herself and the king were present in the camp even the prince of conde joined the kings forces and gave countenance to this enterprise the admiral and andelot alone who still desired to preserve elizabeths friendship kept at a distance and prudently refused to join their ancient enemies in an attack upon their allies  by the force and dispositions and situation of both sides it was expected that the siege would be attended with some very memorable event yet did france make a much easier acquisition of this important place than was at first apprehended the plague crept in among the english soldiers and being increased by their fatigue and bad diet for they were but ill supplied with provisions ibid p          it committed such ravages that sometimes an hundred men a day died of it and there remained not at last fifteen hundred in a condition to do duty ibid p   0      the french meeting with such feeble resistance carried on their attacks successfully and having made two breaches each of them sixty feet wide they prepared for a general assault which must have terminated in the slaughter of the whole garrison forbes vol ii p      havre lost   th july warwic who had frequently warned the council of the danger and who had loudly demanded a supply of men and provisions found himself obliged to capitulate and to content himself with the liberty of withdrawing his garrison the articles were no sooner signed than lord clinton the admiral who had been detained by contrary winds appeared off the harbor with a reinforcement of three thousand men and found the place surrendered to the enemy to increase the misfortune the infected army brought the plague with them into england where it swept off great multitudes particularly in the city of london above twenty thousand persons there died of it in one year thi year the council of trent was dissolved which had sat from      the publication of it decrees excited anew the general serment in europe while the catholics endeavored to enforce the acceptance of them and the protestants rejected them the religious controversies were too far advanced to expect that any conviction would result from the decrees of this council it is the only general council which has been held in an age truly learned and inquisitive and  the history of it has been wrote with great penetration and judgment it has tended very much to expose clerical usurpation and in trigues and may serve us as a specimen of more ancient councils no one expects to see another general council till the decay of learning and the progress of ignorance shall again fit mankind for these great impostures   davila lib     d april it was agreed that the hostages which the french had given for the restitution of calais should be restored for   0000 crowns and that both sides should reserve all their claims and pretensions  scotch affairs the peace still continued with scotland and even a cordial friendship seemed to have been cemented between elizabeth and mary these princesses made profession of the most entire affection wrote amicable letters every week to each other and had adopted in all appearance the sentiments as well as style of sisters elizabeth punished one hales who had composed a book against marys title keith p      and as the lord keeper bacon was thought to have encouraged hales in this undertaking he fell under her displeasure and it was with some difficulty that he wa able to give her satisfaction and recover her good opinion ibid p      the two queens had agreed in the foregoing summer to an interview at york hayres p     in order to remove all difficulties with regard to marys ratification of the treaty of edinburgh and to consider of the proper method for settling the succession of england but as elizabeth carefully avoided touching on this delicate subject she employed a pretext of the wars in france which she said would detain her in london and she delayed till next year the intended interview it is also probable that being well acquainted with the beauty and address and accomplishments of mary she did not choose to stand the comparison with regard to those exterior qualities in which she was eclipsed by her rival and was unwilling that that princess who had already made great progress in the esteem and affections of the english should have a farther opportunity of increasing the number of her partisans  marys close connexions with the house of guise and her devoted attachment to her uncles by whom she had been educated and protected was the ground of just and unsurmountable jealousy to elizabeth who regarded them as her mortal and declared enemies and was well acquainted with their dangerous character and ambitious projects they had made offer of their niece to don carlos philips son to the king of sweden the king of navarre the archduke charles the duke of ferrara the cardinal of bourbon who had only taken deacons orders from which he might easily be absolved and they were ready to marry her to any one who could strengthen their interest or give inquietude and disturbance to elizabeth forbes vol ii p     strype vol i p  00  elizabeth on her part was equally vigilant to obviate the execution of their schemes and was particularly anxious lest mary should form any powerful foreign alliance which might tempt her to revive her pretensions to the crown and to invade the kingdom from the side where it was weakest and lay most exposed keith p        as she believed that the marriage with the archduke charles was the most likely to have place she used every expedient to prevent it and besides remonstrating against it to mary herself she endeavored to draw off the archduke from that pursuit by giving him some reason to hope for success in his pretensions to herself and by inviting him to a renewal of the former treaty of marriage meil p     she always told the queen of scotts that nothing would satisfy her but her espousing some english nobleman who would remove all grounds of jealousy and cement the union between the two kingdoms and she offered on this condition to have her title examined and to declare her the successor to the crown keith p      0         after keeping the matter in these general terms during a twelvemonth she at last named the lord robert dudley now created earl of leicester as the person on whom she desired that marys choice should fall  the earl of leicester the great and powerful favorite of elizabeth possessed all those exterior qualities which are naturally alluring to the fair sex a handsome person a polite address an insinuating behavior and by means of these accomplishments he had been able to blind even the penetration of elizabeth and conceal from her the great defects or rather odious vices which attended his character he was proud insolent interested ambitious without honor without generosity without humanity and attoned not for these bad qualities by any such abilities or courage as could fit him for that high trust and confidence with which she always honored him her constant and declared attachment to him had very naturally emboldened him to aspire to her bed and in order to make way for these nuptials he was universally believed to have murdered in a barbarous manner his wife the heiress of one robesart the proposal of espousing mary was by no means agreeable to him and he always ascribed it to the contrivance of cecil his enemy who intended by that artifice to make him lose the friendship of mary from the temerity of his pretensions and that of elizabeth from jealousy of his attachments to another woman camden p      the queen herself had not any serious intention of effecting this marriage but as she was desirous that the queen of scots should never take any husband she named a man who she believed was not likely to be accepted of and she hoped by that means to gain time and elude the project of any other alliance the earl of leicester was too great a favorite to be parted with and when mary allured by the prospect of being declared successor to the crown seemed at last to hearken to elizabeths proposal this princess receded from her former offers and withdrew the bait which she had formerly thrown out to her rival keith p       0 appendix p    strype vol i p   this duplicity of conduct joined to some appearance of an imperious superiority assumed by her had drawn a peevish letter from mary and the seemingly amicable correspondence of the two queens was during some time interrupted in order to make up this breach the queen of scots dispatched sir james melvil to london who has given us a very particular account of this negotiation  melvil was an agreeable courtier a man of address and conversation and it was recommended to him by his mistress that besides grave reasonings concerning politics and state affairs he should introduce more entertaining topics of conversation suitable to the sprightly character of elizabeth and should endeavor by that means to insinuate himself into her confidence he succeeded so well that he threw that artful princess entirely off her guard haynes p      and brought her to discover the bottom of her heart full of all those levities and follies and ideas of rivalship which possess the youngest and most frivolous of her sex he talked to her of his travels and forgot not to mention the different dresses of the ladies in different countries and the particular advantages of each in setting off the beauties of the shape and person the queen said that she had dresses of all countries and she took care thenceforth to meet the ambassador every day apparelled in a different habit sometimes she was dressed in the english garb sometimes in the french sometimes in the italian and she asked him which of them became her most he answered the italian a reply that he knew would be agreeable to her because that mode showed her flowing locks which he remarked though they were more red than yellow she fancied to be the finest in the world she desired to know of him what was reputed the best color of hair she asked whether his queens hair or hers was best she even enquired which of them he esteemed the fairest person a very delicate question and which he prudently eluded by saying that her majesty was the fairest person in england and his mistress in scotland she next demanded which of them was tallest he replied his queen then said elizabeth she is too tall for i myself am of a just stature having learned from him that his mistress sometimes recreated herself by playing on the harpsicord an instrument at which she herself excelled she gave orders to lord hunsdon that he should lead him as it were casually into an apartment where he might hear her performance and when melvil as if ravished with the harmony broke into the queens apartment she pretended to be displeased at his intrusion but still took care to ask whether he thought mary or her the best performer on that instrument melvil p     from the whole of her behavior melvil thought he might on his return assure his mistress that she had no reason ever to expect any cordial friendship from elizabeth and that all her professions of amity were full of falsehood and dissimulation  after two years had been spent in evasions and artifices keith p   marys subjects and counselors and probably herself began to think it full time that some alliance were concluded and the lord darnley son to the earl of lenox was the person in whom most mens opinions and wishes centered he was marys cousingerman by the lady margaret douglas niece to harry the eighth and daughter to the earl of angus by margaret queen of scotland he had been born and educated in england where the earl of lenox had constantly resided ever since he had been banished by the prevalence of the house of hamilton and as darnley was now in his twentieth year and was a very comely person tall and delicately shaped it was hoped that he might soon render himself agreeable to the queen of scots he was also by his father a branch of the same family with herself and would in espousing her preserve the royal dignity in the house of stuart he was after her next heir to the crown of england and those who pretended to exclude her on account of her being a foreigner had endeavored to recommend his title and give it the preference it seemed no inconsiderable advantage that she could by marrying him unite both their claims and as he was by birth an englishman and could not by his power or alliances give any ground of suspicion to elizabeth it was hoped that the proposal of this marriage would not be unacceptable to that jealous princess  elizabeth was well informed of these intentions of the court of edinburgh keith p      and was secretly not displeased with the projected marriage between darnley and the queen of scots keith p   0     jebb vol ii p     she would rather have wished that mary had continued for ever in a single life but finding little probability of rendering this scheme effectual she was satisfied with a choice which freed her at once from the dread of a foreign alliance and from the necessity of parting with leicester her favorite in order to pave the way to darnleys marriage she secretly desired mary to invite lenox into scotland to reverse his attainder and to restore him to his honors and fortune keith p            and when her request was complied with she took care in order to preserve the friendship of the hamiltons and her other partisans in scotland to blame openly this conduct of mary melvil p       th july and though it was impossible for her to assign one single reason of her displeasure keith p          she menaced and protested and complained as if she had suffered the most grievous injury in the world  the politics of elizabeth though judicious were usually full of duplicity and artifice but never more so than in her transactions with the queen of scots where there entered so many little passions and narrow jealousies that she dust not avow to the world the reasons of her conduct scarcely to her ministers and scarcely even to herself but besides a womanish rivalship and envy against the marriage of this princess she had some motives of interest for feigning a displeasure on the present occasion it served her as a pretense for refusing to acknowledge marys title to the succession of england a point to which she was determined never to consent and it was useful to her for a purpose still more unfriendly and dangerous for encouraging the discontents and rebellion of the scotch nobility and ecclesiastics keith p   0   nothing can be more unhappy for a people than to be governed by a sovereign who is attached to a religion different from that which is established and it is scarce possible that a mutual confidence can ever in such a situation have place between the prince and his subjects marys conduct had been hitherto in every respect unexceptionable and even laudable yet had she not made such progress in acquiring popularity as might have been expected from her gracious deportment and agreeable accomplishments suspicions every moment prevailed on account of her attachment to the catholic faith and especially to her uncles the open and avowed promoters of the scheme for exterminating the professors of the reformed religion throughout all europe she still refused to ratify the acts of parliament which had established the reformation she made attempts for restoring to the catholic bishops some part of their civil jurisdiction spotswood p      and she wrote a letter to the council of trent in which besides professing her attachment to the catholic faith she took notice of her title to succeed to the crown of england and expressed her hopes of being able in some period to bring back all her dominions to the bosom

enacted making it capital even on the first offense to say mass any where except in the queens chapel keith p      and it was with great difficulty that this small indulgence was granted her the general assembly importuned her anew to change her religion to renounce the blasphemous idolatry of the mass with the tyranny of the roman antichrist and to embrace the true religion of christ jesus keith p     knox p     as she answered with temper that she was not yet convinced of the falsehood of her religion or the impiety of the mass and that her apostasy would lose her the friendship of her allies on the continent they replied by assuring her that their religion was undoubtedly the same which had been revealed by jesus christ which had been preached by the apostles and which had been embraced by the faithful in the primitive ages that neither the religion of turks jews nor papists was built on so solid a foundation as theirs that they alone of all the various species of religionists spread over the face of the earth were so happy as to be possessed of the truth that those who hear or rather who gaze on the mass allow sacrilege pronounce blasphemy and commit most abominable idolatry and that the friendship of the king of kings was preferable to all the confederacies and alliances in the world keith   0       the queen of scots marries the earl of darnley the marriage of the queen of scots had kindled afresh the zeal of the reformers because the family of lenox was believed to adhere to the catholic faith and though darnley who now bore the name of king henry went often to the established church he could not by this exterior compliance gain the confidence and regard of the ecclesiastics they rather laid hold of this opportunity to insult him to his face and knox scrupled not to tell him from the pulpit that god for punishment of the offenses and ingratitude of the people was wont to commit the rule over them to boys and women ibid p     knox p      the populace of edinburgh instigated by such doctrine began to meet and to associate themselves against the government knox p      but what threatened with more immediate danger marys authority were the discontents which prevailed among some of the principal nobility  the duke of chatelrault was displeased with the restoration and still more with the aggrandizement of the family of lenox his hereditary enemies and entertained fears lest his eventual succession to the crown of scotland should be excluded by his rival who had formerly advanced some pretensions to it the earl of murray found his credit at court much diminished by the interest of lenox and his son and began to apprehend the revocation of some considerable grants which he had obtained from marys liberality the earls of argyle rothes and glencairne the lords boyde and ochiltry kirkaldy of grange pittarow were instigated by like motives and as these were the persons who had most zealously promoted the reformation they were disgusted to find that the queens favor was entirely engrossed by a new cabal the earls of bothwel athole sutherland and huntley men who were esteemed either lukewarm in religious controversy or inclined to the catholic party the same ground of discontent which in other courts is the source of intrigue faction and opposition commonly produced in scotland either projects of assassination or of rebellion and besides mutual accusations of the former kind which it is difficult to clear up it appears however from randolfs etter keith p   0 that some others had been made to that minister of seizing lenox and darnley and delivering them into queen elizabeths hd mol vil confirms the same story and says that the design wa acknowledged by the  this serves to justify the account given by the

religion framed engagements for mutual defense and made applications to elizabeth for assistance and protection keith p         00 0   that princess after publishing the expressions of her displeasure against the marriage had secretly ordered her ambassadors randolf and throcmorton to give in her name some promises of support to the malcontents and had even sent them a supply of ten thousand pounds

them to appear at court in order to answer for their conduct and having levied some forces to execute the laws she obliged the malcontents to leave the low country and take shelter in argyleshire that she might more effectually cut off all their resources she proceeded with the king to glasgow and forced them from their retreat they appeared at paisly in the neighborhood with about a thousand horse and passing the queens army proceeded to hamilton and thence to edinburgh which they entered without resistance they expected great reinforcements in this place from the efforts of knox and the seditious preachers and they beat their drums desiring all men to enlist and receive wages for the defense of gods glory knox p     but the nation was in no disposition for rebellion mary was esteemed and beloved her marriage was not generally disagreeable to the people and the interested views of the malecontent lords were so well known that their pretense of zeal for religion had little influence

amounted to eighteen thousand men ibid   they found themselves under a necessity of abandoning their country and of taking shelter in england  elizabeth when she found the event so much to disappoint her expectations thought proper to disown all connections with the scotch malcontents and to declare every where that she had never given them any encouragement or any promise of countenance or assistance she even carried farther her dissimulation and hypocrisy murray had come to london with the abbot of kilwinning agent for chatelrault and she seduced them by secret assurances of protection to declare before the ambassadors of france and spain that she had nowise contributed to their insurrection no sooner had she extorted this confession from them than she chased them from her presence

council to authorize the engagements which he had been obliged to take with them melvil p  0   the banished lords finding themselves so ill used by elizabeth had recourse to the clemency of their sovereign and after some solicitation and some professions of sincere repentance the duke of chatelrault obtained his pardon on condition that he should retire into france mary was more implacable against the ungrateful earl of murray and the other confederates on whom she threw the chief blame of the enterprise but as she was continually plied with applications from their friends and as some of her most judicious partisans in england thought that nothing would more promote her interests in that kingdom than the gentle treatment of men so celebrated for their zeal against the catholic religion she agreed to give way to her natural temper which inclined not to severity and she seemed determined to restore them to her favor ibid p     0          keith p      in this interval rambouillet arrived as ambassador from france and brought her advice from her uncle the cardinal of lorraine to whose opinion she always paid an extreme deference by no means to pardon these protestant leaders who had been engaged in a rebellion against her keith p     melvil p      the two religions in france as well as in other parts of europe were rather irritated than satiated with their mutual violences and the peace granted to the ugonots as had been foreseen by the admiral was intended only to lull them asleep and prepare the way for their final and absolute destruction the queenregent made a pretense of traveling through the kingdom in order to visit the provinces and correct all the abuses arising from the late war and after having held some conferences on the frontiers with the duke of lorraine and the duke of savoy she came to bayonne where she was met by her daughter the queen of spain and the duke of alva nothing appeared in the congress of these two splendid courts but gaity festivity love and joy but amidst these smiling appearances were secretly fabricated schemes the most bloody and the most destructive to the repose of mankind which had ever been thought of in any age or nation no less than a total and universal extermination of the protestants by fire and sword was concerted by philip and catherine of medicis and alva agreeable to his fierce and sanguinary disposition advised the queenregent to commence the execution of this project by the immediate massacre of all the leaders of the hugonots vila lib iii  but that princess though equally hardened against every humane sentiment would not forego this opportunity of displaying her wit and refined politics and she proposed rather by treachery and dissimulation which she called address to lead the protestants into the snare and never to draw the sword till they were totally disabled from resistance confederacy against the protestants the cardinal of lorraine whose character bore a greater affinity to that of alva was a chief author of this barbarous association against the reformers and having connected his prospect of success with the aggrandizement of his niece the queen of scots he took care that her measures should agree with those violent councils which were embraced by the other catholic princes it is not probable it is however positively affirmed by randolf the  appen p    that he entrusted the depth of this dangerous secret with that young princess but he had acquired such authority over her that he turned her from the road of clemency which she intended to have followed and made her resolve on the total ruin of the banished lords melvil p      the marriage of the queen of scots with lord darnley was so natural and so inviting in all its circumstances that it had been precipitantly agreed to by that princess and her council and while she was allured by his youth and beauty and exterior accomplishments she had at first overlooked the qualities of his ind which no wise corresponded with the excellence of his outward figure violent yet variable in his enterprises insolent yet credulous and easily governed by flatterers he was devoid of all gratitude because he thought no favors equal to his merit and being addicted to low pleasures he was equally incapable of all true sentiments of love and tenderness keith p         appen p      the queen of scots in the first effusions of her fondness had taken a pleasure in exalting him beyond measure she had granted him the title of king she had joined his name with her own in all public acts she intended to have procured him from the states a matrimonial crown but having leisure afterward to remark his weakness and vices she began to see the danger of her profuse liberality and was resolved thenceforth to proceed with more reserve in the trust which she conferred upon him his resentment against this prudent conduct served but the more to increase her disgust and the young prince enraged at her imagined neglects pointed his vengeance against every one whom he esteemed the cause of this change in her measures and behavior  murder of rizzio there was one david rizzio in the court who had of late obtained a very extraordinary degree of confidence and favor with the queen of scots he was a piedmontese of mean birth son to a teacher of music himself a musician and finding it difficult to subsist by his art in his own country he had followed into scotland an ambassador whom the duke of savoy sent thither to pay his compliments to mary some time after her first arrival he possessed a good ear and a tolerable voice and as that princess found him useful to complete her band of music she retained him in her service after the departure of his master her secretary for french dispatches having some time after fallen under her displeasure she promoted rizzio to that office which gave him frequent opportunities of approaching her person and insinuating himself into her favor he was shrewd and sensible as well as aspiring much beyond his rank and education and made so good use of the access which fortune had procured him that he was soon regarded as the chief confident and counselor of the queen he was consulted on all occasions no favors could be obtained but by his intercession all suitors were obliged to gain him by presents and flattery and the man insolent from his new exaltation as well as rapacious in his acquisitions soon drew on himself the hatred of the nobility and of the whole kingdom keith p      0  crawfords memoirs p  spotswood p      he had at first employed his credit to promote darnleys marriage and a firm friendship seemed to be established between them but on the subsequent change of the queens sentiments it was easy for henrys friends to persuade him that rizzio was the real author of her indifference and even to rouse in his mind jealousies of a more dangerous nature the favorite was of a disagreeable figure but was not past his youth  he was ugly but it may be ined from the  of that author  he  that o the return o the  savoy to  in the  of youth now that   and though the opinion of his criminal correspondence with mary might seem of itself unreasonable if not absurd a suspicious husband could find no other means of accounting for that lavish and imprudent kindness with which she honored him the rigid austerity of the ecclesiastics who could admit of no freedoms contributed to spread this opinion among the people and as rizzio was universally believed to be a pensionary of the pope and to be deeply engaged in all schemes against the protestants any story to his and marys disadvantage received an easy credit among the zealots of that communion  rizzio who had connected his interest with the roman catholics was the declared enemy of the banished lords and by promoting the violent prosecution against them had exposed himself to the animosity of their numerous friends and retainers a scheme was also thought to be formed for revoking some exorbitant grants made during the queens minority and even the nobility who had seized the ecclesiastical benefices began to think themselves less secure in the possession of them keith p    melvil p     the earl of morton chancellor was affected by all these considerations and still more by a rumor spread abroad that mary intended to appoint rizzio chancellor in his place and to bestow that dignity on a mean and upstart foreigner who was ignorant of the laws and language of the country  xvii  crawford p    p    knox p     jebb vol  p   so indiscreet had this princess been in her kindness to rizzio that even that strange report met with credit and proved a great means of accelerating the ruin of the favorite morton insinuating himself into henrys confidence employed all his art to inflame the discontent and jealousy of that prince and he persuaded him that the only means of freeing himself from the indignities under which he labored was to bring the base stranger to that fate which he had so well merited and which was so passionately desired by the whole nation george douglas natural brother to the countess of lenox concurred in the same advice and the lords ruthven and lindesey being consulted offered their concurrence in the enterprise nor was even the earl of lenox the kings father averse to the design crawford p    but as these conspirators were well acquainted with henrys levity they engaged him to sign a paper in which he avowed the undertaking and promised to protect them against every consequence which might ensue upon the assassination of rizzio goo vol i p    crawford p    all these measures being fully concerted a messenger was dispatched to the banished lords who were hovering near the borders and they were invited by the king to return to their native country   th march this design so atrocious in itself was rendered still more so by the circumstances which attended its execution mary who was in the seventh month of her pregnancy was supping in private and had at table the countess of argyle her natural sister with rizzio and others of her servants the king entered the room by a private passage and stood at the back of marys chair the lord ruthven george douglas and other conspirators being all armed rushed in after him and the queen of scots terrified with the appearance demanded of them the reason of this rude intrusion they told her that they intended no violence against her person but meant only to bring that villain pointing at rizzio to his deserved punishment rizzio aware of the danger ran behind his mistress and seizing her by the waist called aloud to her for protection while she interposed in his behalf with cries and menaces and entreaties the impatient assassins regardless of her efforts rushed upon their prey and by overturning every thing which stood in their way increased the horror and confusion of the scene douglas seizing henrys dagger stuck it in the body of rizzio who screaming with fear and agony was torn from mary by the other conspirators and pushed into the antichamber where he was dispatched with fiftysix wounds melvil p    keith p   0     crawford p    the unhappy princess informed of his fate immediately dried her tears and said she would weep no more she would now think of revenge the insult indeed upon her person the stain attempted to be fixed on her honor the danger to which her life was exposed on account of her pregnancy were injuries so atrocious and so complicated that they scarce left room for pardon even from the greatest lenity and mercy  the assassins apprehensive of marys resentment detained her a prisoner in the palace and the king dismissed all those who seemed willing to attempt her rescue by telling them that nothing was done without his orders and that he would be careful of the queens safety murray and the banished lords appeared two days after and mary whose anger was now engrossed by injuries more recent and violent was willingly reconciled to them and she even received her brother with tenderness and affection they obtained an acquital from the parliament and were reinstated in their honors and fortunes the accomplices also in rizzios murder applied to her for a pardon but she artfully delayed compliance and persuaded them that so long as she was detained in custody and was surrounded by guards any deed which she should sign would have no force nor validity mean while she had gained the confidence of her husband by her persuasion and caresses and no sooner were the guards withdrawn than she engaged him to escape with her in the night time and take shelter in dunbar many of her subjects here offered her their assistance and mary having collected an army which the conspirators had no power to resist advanced to edinburgh and obliged them of fly into england where they lived in great poverty and distress they made applications however to the earl of bothwel a new favorite of marys and that nobleman desirous to strengthen his party by the accession of their interest was able to pacify her resentment and he soon after procured them liberty to return into their own country melvil p       keith p    knox p       the vengeance of the queen of scots was implacable against her husband alone whose person was before disagreeable to her and who by his violation of every tie of gratitude and duty had drawn on him her highest resentment she engaged him to disown all connections with the assassins to deny any concurrence in their crime even to publish a proclamation containing a falsehood so notorious to the whole world goodall vol i p   0 keith appen p      and having thus made him expose himself to universal contempt and rendered it impracticable for him ever aster to acquire the confidence of any party she threw him off with disdain and indignation melvil p        as if she had been making an escape from him she suddenly withdrew to alloa a seat of the earl of mar and when henry followed her thither she returned suddenly to edinburgh and gave him every where the strongest proofs of displeasure and even of antipathy she encouraged her courtiers in their neglect of him and she was pleased that his mean equipage and small train of attendants should draw on him the contempt of the very populace he was permitted however to have apartments in the castle of edinburgh which mary had chosen for the place of her delivery   th june she was there delivered of a son and as this was very important news to england as well as to scotland she immediately dispatched sir james melvil to carry intelligence of the happy event to elizabeth melvil tells us that that princess the evening of his arrival in london had given a ball to her court at greenwich and was displaying all that spirit and alacity which usually attended her on these occasions but when the prince of scotlands birth was notified to her all her joy was damped she sunk into melancholy she reclined her head upon her arm and complained tosome of her attendants that the queen of scots was mother of a fair son while she was but a barren stock next day however on the reception of the scotch ambassador she assumed her former dissimulation put on a joyful countenance gave melvil thanks for the haste he had made in conveying to her the agreeable intelligence and expressed the utmost cordiality and friendship to her sister melvil p     0  some time after she dispatched the earl of bedford with her relation george carry son to the lord hunsdon in order to officiate at the baptism of the young prince and she sent by them some magnificent presents to the queen of scots  the birth of a son gave additional zeal to marys partisans in england camden p   and even men of all parties began to cry aloud for some settlement of the succession  th september a parliament these humors broke out with great vehemence in a new session of parliament which was held after six prorogations the house of peers which had hitherto forborne to touch on the delicate point of the succession here took the lead and the house of commons soon after imitated the zeal of the lords molineux opened the matter in the lower house and proposed that the question of the succession and that of supply should go hand in hand as if it were intended to constrain the queen to a compliance with the request of her parliament dewes p      the courtiers endeavored to elude the debate sir ralph sadler told the house that he had heard the queen positively affirm that for the good of her people she was determined to marry secretary cecil and sir francis knollys gave their testimony to the same purpose as did also sir ambrose cave chancellor of the duchy and sir edward rogers comptroler of the household ibid p     elizabeths ambitious and masculine character was so well known that few members gave any credit to this intelligence and it was considered merely as an artifice by which she endeavored to retract that positive affirmation which she had made in the beginning of her reign that she meant to live and die a virgin the ministers therefore gained nothing farther by this piece of policy but only to engage the house for the sake of decency to join the question of the queens marriage with that of a settlement of the crown and they were proceeding with great earnestness in the debate and had even appointed a committee to confer with the lords when express orders were brought them from elizabeth not to proceed farther in that matter cecil told them that she pledged to the house the word of a queen for her sincerity in her intentions to marry that the appointment of a successor would be attended with great danger to her person that she herself had bad experience during the reign of her sister how much court was paid to the next heir and what dangerous sacrifices men were commonly disposed to make of their present duty to their future prospects and that she was therefore determined to delay till a more proper opportunity the decision of that important question dewes p          the house were not satisfied with these reasons and still less with the command prohibiting them all debate on that subject paul wentworth a spirited member went so far as to question whether such a prohibition were not an infringement of the liberties and privileges of the house ibid p      some even ventured to violate that profound respect which they had hitherto preserved to the queen and affirmed that she was bound in duty not only to provide for the happiness of her subjects during her own life but also to pay regard to their future security by fixing a successor that by fixing a successor that by a contrary conduct she showed herself the stepmother not the natural parent of her people and would seem desirous that england should no longer subsist than she should enjoy the glory and satisfaction of governing it that none but timorous princes or tyrants or faint hearted women ever stood in fear of their successors and that the affections of the people were a firm and impregnable rampart to every sovereign who laying aside all artifice or by ends had courage and magnanimity to put his sole trust in that honorable and sure defense camden p  00  the queen hearing of these debates sent for the speaker and after reiterating her former prohibition she bid him inform the house that if any member remained still unsatisfied he might appear before the privy council and there give his reasons dewes p      as the members showed a disposition notwithstanding these peremptory orders still to proceed upon the question elizabeth thought proper by a message to revoke them and to allow the house liberty of debate ibid p   0  they were so mollified by this gracious condescension that they thenceforth conducted the matter with more calmness and temper and they even voted her a supply to be levied at three payments of a subsidy and a fifteenth without annexing any condition to it   january the queen soon after dissolved the parliament and told them with some sharpness in the conclusion that their proceedings had contained much dissimulation and artifice that under the plausible pretenses of marriage and succession many of them covered very malevolent intentions to wards her but that however she reaped this advantage from their attempts that she could now distinguish her friends from her enemies but do you think added she that i am unmindful of your future security or will be negligent in settling the succession that is the chief object of my concern as i know myself to be liable to mortality or do you apprehend that i meant to incroach on your liberties no it was never my meaning i only intended to stop you before you approached the precipice all things have their time and though you may be blessed with a sovereign more wise or more learned than i yet i assure you that no one will ever rule over you who shall be more careful of your safety and therefore henceforward whether i live to see the like assembly or no or whoever holds the reins of government let me warn you to beware of provoking your sovereigns patience so far as you have done mine but i shall now conclude notwithstanding the disgusts i have received for i mean not to part with you in anger that the greatest part of you may assure themselves that they go home in their princes good graces dewes p           elizabeth carried farther her dignity on this occasion she had received the subsidy without any condition but as it was believed that the commons had given her that gratuity with a view of engaging her to yield to their requests she thought proper on her refusal to remit voluntarily the third payment and she said that money in her subjects purses was as good as in her own exchequer camden p  00   but though the queen was able to elude for the present the applications of parliament the friends of the queen of scots multiplied every day in england and besides the catholics many of whom kept treasonable correspondence with her and were ready to rise at her command haynes p          the court itself of elizabeth was full of her avowed partisans the duke of norfolk the earls of leicester pembroke bedford northumberland sir nicholas throcmorton and most of the considerable men in england except cecil seemed convinced of the necessity of declaring her the successor none but the more zealous protestants adhered either to the countess of hartford or to her younger sister eleanor who had espoused the earl of cumberland and as the marriage of the former seemed liable to some objections and had been declared invalid men were alarmed even on that side with the prospect of new disputes concerning the succession marys behavior also so moderate toward the protestants and so gracious toward all men had procured her universal respect melvin p           and the public was willing to ascribe any imprudences into which she had fallen to her youth and inexperience but all these slattering prospects were blasted by the subsequent incidents where her egregious indiscretions shall i say or atrocious crimes threw her from the height of her prosperity and involved her in infamy and ruin  the earl of bothwel was of a considerable family and power in scotland and though not distinguished by any talents either of a civil or military nature he had made a figure in that party which opposed the greatness of the earl of murray and the more rigid reformers murder of darnley he was a man of profligate manners had involved his opulent fortune in great debts and even reduced himself to beggary by his profuse expenses keith p   0  and seemed to have no resource but in desperate councils and enterprises he had been accused more than once of an attempt to assassinate murray and notwithstanding that the frequency of these accusations on all sides diminish somewhat the credit due to any particular imputation they prove sufficiently the prevalence of that detestable practice in scotland and may in that view serve to render such rumors the more likely and credible this man had of late acquired the favor and entire confidence of mary and all her measures were directed by his advice and authority reports were spread of more particular intimacies and familiarities between them and these reports gained ground from the continuance or rather increase of her hatred toward her husband melvil p        that young prince was reduced to such a state of desperation by the neglects which he underwent from his queen and the courtiers that he had once resolved to fly secretly into france or spain and had even provided himself of a vessel for that purpose keith p         some of the most considerable nobility on the other hand observing her fixed aversion to him had proposed some expedients for a divorce and though mary is said to have spoke honorably on that occasion and to have embraced the proposal no farther than it should be found consistent with her own honor and her sons legitimacy camden p  0  goodals queen mary vol ii p      men were inclined to believe that the difficulty of finding proper means for effectuating that purpose was the real cause of laying aside all farther thoughts of it so far were the suspicions against her carried that when henry discouraged with the continual proofs of her hatred left the court and retired to glasgow an illness of an extraordinary nature with which he was seized immediately on his arrival in that place was universally ascribed by her enemies to a dose of poison which it was pretended she had administered to him  while affairs were on this footing all those who wished well to her character or the repose of their country were extremely pleased and somewhat surprised to hear that a friendship was again conciliated between them that she had taken a journey to glasgow on purpose to visit him during his sickness that she behaved toward him with great tenderness that she had brought him along with her and that she appeared thenceforth determined to live with him on a sooting more suitable to the connexions between them henry naturally uxorious and not mistrusting this sudden reconcilement put himself implicitly into her hands and attended her to edinburgh she lived in the palace of holyroodhouse but as the situation of that place was low and the concourse of persons about the court was necessarily attended with noise which might disturb him in his present infirm state of health these reasons were assigned for fitting up an apartment for him in a solitary house at some distance called the kirk of field mary here gave him marks of kindness and attachment she conversed cordially with him and she lay some nights in a room below his but on the ninth of february she told him that she would pass that night in the palace because the marriage of one of her servants was there to be celebrated in her presence  0th february about two oclock in the morning the whole town was much alarmed at hearing a great noise and were still more astonished when it was discovered that the noise came from the kings house which was blown up by gunpowder that his dead body was found at some distance in a neighboring field and that no marks either of fire contusion or violence appeared upon it it was imagined that henry had been strangled before the house was blown up but this supposition is contradicted by the confession of the criminals and there is no necessity to admit it in order to account for the condition of his body there are many instances that mens lives have been saved who have been blown up in ships had henry fallen on water he had not probably been killed   no doubt could be entertained but henry was murdered and the general conjecture soon pointed toward the earl of bothwel as the author of that crime melvil p   cabbala p      but as his favor with mary was open and visible and his power great no one ventured to declare openly his sentiments and all men remained in silence and mute astonishment voices however were heard in the streets during the darkness of the night proclaiming bothwel and even mary herself to be the murderers of the king placards were secretly affixed to the same purpose offers were made that upon giving proper securities his guilt should be openly proved but after one proclamation from the court offering a reward and indemnity to any one that would discover the author of that villainy greater vigilance was employed in

secret council by whom mary was governed not trusting entirely to precipitation violence and authority had provided this plea by which they ensured at all adventures a plausible pretense for acquitting bothwel  two days after this extraordinary transaction a parliament was held and though the sentence in favor of bothwel was attended with such circumstances as strongly confirmed rather than diminished the general opinion of his guilt he was the person chosen to carry the royal scepter on the first meeting of that national assembly keith p    crawford p     in this parliament a rigorous act was made against those who set up defamatory placards but no notice was taken of the kings murder keith p   0 the queen in order to gain the people agreed to an act of parliament which established the protestant religion a concession which she could never before be brought to make  the favor which mary openly bore to bothwel kept every one in awe and the effects of this terror appeared more plainly in another transaction which ensued immediately upon the dissolution of the parliament a bond or association was framed in which the subscribers after relating the acquital of bothwel by a legal trial and a farther offer which he had made to prove his innocence by single combat oblige themselves in case any person should afterward impute to him the kings murder to support him with their whole power against such calumniators after this promise which implied no great assurance in bothwel of his own innocence the subcribers mentioned the necessity of their queens marriage in order to support the government and they recommended bothwel to her as a husband keith p        th april this paper was subscribed by all the considerable nobility there present in a country divided by violent factions such a concurrence in favor of one nobleman no wise distinguished above the rest except by his flagitious conduct could never have been obtained had not every one been certain at least firmly persuaded that mary was fully determined on this measure mary herself confessed in her instructions to the ambassadors which she sent to france tha bothwel persuaded all the noblemen that their application in favor of his marriage was agreable to her keith p     andson vol i p    murray afterward produced to queen lizabeths commissioners a paper signed by mary by which she permitted them to make this application to her this permission was a sufficient declaration of her intentions and was eseemed equivalent to a command anderson vol iv p    they even asserted that the house in which they met w surrounded with amed men oodal vol ii p      nor would such a motive have sufficed to influence men commonly so stubborn and intractable had they not been taken by surprise been ignorant of each others sentiments and overawed by the present power of the court and by the apprehensions of farther violence from persons so little governed by any rules of honor and humanity even with all these circumstances the subscription to this paper may justly be regarded as a reproach to the nation  the subsequent measures of bothwel were equally precipitant and audacious mary having gone to stirling to pay a visit to her son he assembled a body of eight hundred horse under pretense of pursuing some robbers on the borders and having waylaid her on her return he seized her person near edinburgh and carried her to dunbar with an avowed design of forcing her to yield to his purpose   th april sir james melvil who was in her retinue was carried along with her and says not that he saw any signs of reluctance or constraint he was even informed as he tells us by one of bothwels officers that the whole transaction was managed in concert with her melvil p  0  a woman indeed of that spirit and resolution which is acknowledged to belong to mary does not usually on these occasions give such marks of opposition to real violence as can appear any wise doubtful or ambiguous some of the nobility however in order to put matters to farther trial sent her a private message in which they told her that if in reality she lay under force they would use all their efforts to relieve her her answer was that she had indeed been carried to dunbar by violence but since her arrival had been so well treated there that she willingly remained with bothwel spotswood p  0   no one gave themselves thenceforth any solicitude to relieve her from a captivity which they believed to have proceeded entirely from her own approbation and connivance  this unusual conduct was at first ascribed to marys sense of the infamy attending her purposed marriage and her desire of finding some color to gloss over the irregularity of her conduct but a pardon given to bothwel a few days afterward made the public carry somewhat farther their conjectures in this deed bothwel received a remission for the violence committed on the queens person and for all other crimes a clause by which the murder of the king was indirectly pardoned the rape was then conjectured to be only a contrivance of these politicians in order to afford a pretense for indirectly remitting a crime of which they durst not openly make any mention anderson vol iv part   p      these events passed with such rapidity that men had no leisure to admire sufficiently one incident when they were surprised with a new one equally rare and uncommon there still however remained one difficulty which it was not easy to foresee how the queen and bothwel determined as they were to execute their shameful purpose could find expedients to overcome the man who had procured the subscription of the nobility recommending him as a husband to the queen and who had acted this seeming violence on her person in order to force her consent had been married six months before to another woman to a woman of merit of a very noble family sister to the earl of huntley but persons blinded with passion and infatuated with crimes soon shake off all appearance of decency a suit was commenced for a divorce between bothwel and his wife and this suit was opened at the same instant in two different or rather opposite courts in the court of the archbishop of st andrews which was popish and governed itself by the canon law and in the new consistorial or commissariot court which was protestant and was regulated by the principles of the reformed teachers the plea advanced in each court was so calculated as to suit the principles which there prevailed in the archbishops court the pretense of consanguinity was employed because bothwel was related to his wife in the fourth degree in the commisariot court the accusation of adultery was made use of against him the parties too who applied for the divorce were different in the different courts bothwel was the person who sued in the former his wife in the latter and the suit in both courts was opened pleaded examined and decided with the utmost precipitation and a sentence of divorce was pronounced in four days anderson vol ii p   0   the divorce being thus obtained it was thought proper that mary should be conducted to edinburgh and should there appear before the courts of judicature and should acknowledge herself to be restored to entire freedom this was understood to be contrived with a view of obviating all doubts with regard to the validity of her marriage orders were then given to publish the banns in the church between the queen and the duke of orkney for that was the title which he now bore and craig a minister of edinburgh was applied to for that purpose this clergyman not content with having for some time refused compliance publicly in his sermons condemned the marriage and exhorted all those who had access to the queen to give her their advice against so scandalous an alliance being called before the council to answer for this liberty he showed a courage which might cover the whole nobles with shame on account of their tameness and servility he said that by the rules of the church the earl of bothwel being convicted of adultery could not be permitted to marry that the divorce between him and his former wife was plainly procured by collusion as appeared by the precipitation of that sentence and the sudden conclusion of his marriage with the queen and that all the suspicions which prevailed with regard to the kings murder and the queens concurrence in the former rape would thence receive undoubted confirmation he therefore exhorted bothwel who was present no longer to persevere in his present criminal enterprises and turning his discourse to the other counselors he charged them to employ all their influence with the queen in diverting her from a measure which would cover her with infamy and dishonor not satisfied even with this admonition he took the first opportunity of informing the public from the pulpit of this whole transaction and expressed to them his fears that notwithstanding all remonstrances their sovereign was still obstinately bent on her fatal purpose for himself he said he had already discharged his conscience and yet again would take heaven and earth to witness that he abhorred and detested that marriage as scandalous and hateful in the sight of mankind but since the great as he perceived either by their flattery or silence gave countenance to the measure he besought the faithful to pray fervently to the almighty that a resolution which was taken contrary to all law reason and good conscience might by the divine blessing be turned to the comfort and benefit of the church and kingdom these speeches offended the court extremely and craig was anew summoned before the council to answer for his temerity in thus passing the bounds of his commission but he told them that the bounds of his commission were the word of god good laws and natural reason and were the queens marriage tried by any of these three standards it would appear infamous and dishonorable and would be so esteemed by the whole world the council were so overawed by this heroic behavior in a private clergyman that they dismissed him without farther censure or punishment spotswood p  0  anderson vol ii p   0   but though this transaction might have recalled bothwel and the queen of scots from their infatuation and might have instructed them in the dispositions of the people as well as their own inability to oppose them they were still resolute to rush forward to their own manifest destruction    may queen of scots marties bothwl the marriage was celebrated by the bishop of orkney a protestant who was afterward deposed by the church for this scandalous compliance few of the nobility appeared at the ceremony for they had most of them either from shame or fear retired to their own houses the french ambassador le croc an aged gentleman of honor and character could not be prevailed on though a dependent of the house of guise to countenance the marriage by his presence spotswood p  melvil p     elizabeth remonstrated by very friendly letters and messages against the marriage  p     digges p     the court of france made like oppotition but mary though on all other occasions she was extremely obsequious to the advice of her relations in that country was here determined to pay no regard to their opinion  the news of these transactions being carried to foreign countries filled all europe with amazement and threw infamy not only on the principal actors in them but also on the whole nation who seemed by their submission and silence and even by their declared approbation to give their sanction to these scandalous practices melvil p    keith p  0  anderson vol i p          the scotch who resided abroad met with such reproaches that they durst no where appear in public and they earnestly exhorted their countrymen at home to free them from the public odium by bringing to condign punishment the authors of such atrocious crimes this intelligence with a little more leisure for reflection roused men at last from their lethargy and the rumors which from the very beginning crawford p    keith pref p    had been spread against mary as if she had concurred in the kings murder seemed now by the subsequent transactions to have received a strong confirmation and authority it was every where said that even though no particular and direct proofs had as yet been produced of the queens guilt the whole tenor of her late conduct was sufficient not only to beget suspicion but to produce entire conviction against her that her sudden resolution of being reconciled to her husband whom before she had long and justly hated her bringing him to court from which she had banished him by neglects and rigours her fitting up separate apartments for him were all of them circumstances which though trivial in themselves yet being compared with the following events bore a very unfavourable aspect for her that the least which after the kings murder might have been expected in her situation was a more than usual caution in her measures and an extreme anxiety to punish the real assassins in order to free herself from all reproach and suspicion that no woman who had any regard to her character would allow a man publicly accused of her husbands murder so much as to approach her presence far less give him a share in her councils and endow him with favor and authority that an acquital merely in the absence of accusers was very ill fitted to satisfy the public especially if that absence proceeded from a designed precipitation of the sentence and from the terror which her known friendship for the criminal had infused into every one that the very mention of her marriage to such a person in such circumstances was horrible and the contrivance of extorting a consent of the nobility and of concerting a rape were gross artifices more proper to betray her guilt than prove her innocence that where a woman thus shows a consciousness of merited reproach and instead of correcting provides only thin glosses to cover her exceptionable conduct she betrays a neglect of fame which must either be the effect or the cause of the most shameful enormities that to espouse a man who had a few days before been so scandalously divorced from his wife who to say the least was believed to have a few months before assassinated her husband was so contrary to the plainest rules of behavior that no pretense of indiscretion or imprudence could account for such a conduct that a woman who so soon after her husbands death though not attended with any extraordinary circumstances contracts a marriage which might in itself be the most blameless cannot escape severe censure but one who overlooks for her pleasure so many other weighty considerations was equally capable in gratifying her appetites to neglect every regard to honor and to humanity that mary was not ignorant of the prevailing opinion of the public with regard to her own guilt and of the inferences which would every where be drawn from her conduct and therefore if she still continued to pursue measures which gave such just offense she ratified by her actions as much as by the most formal confession all the surmizes and imputations of her enemies that the only circumstance which opposed all these presumptions was the benignity and goodness of her preceding behavior which seemed to remove her from all suspicion of such atrocious inhumanity but that the characters of men were extremely variable and the persons who were guilty of the worst actions were not always naturally of the worst and most criminal dispositions that a woman who in a critical and dangerous moment had sacrificed her honor to a man of abandoned principles might thenceforth be led blindfold by him to the commission of the most enormous crimes and was in reality no longer at her own disposal and that though one supposition was still left to alleviate her blame viz that bothwel presuming on her affection toward him had of himself committed the crime and had never communicated it to her yet such a sudden and passionate love to a man whom she had long known could not easily be accounted for without supposing some degree of preceding guilt and as it appeared that she was not afterward restrained either by shame or prudence from incurring the highest reproach and danger it was not likely that a sense of duty or humanity would have a more powerful influence over her  these were the general sentiments which prevailed throughout scotland and as the protestant teachers who had great authority had long borne a great animosity toward mary the opinion of her guilt was by that means the more widely diffused and made the deeper impression on every one some attempts made by bothwel and as it is pretended with her consent to get the young prince into his power excited the most serious attention and the principal nobility even many of those who had formerly been constrained to sign the application in favor of bothwels marriage met at stirling and formed an association for protecting the prince and punishing the kings murderers keith p      the earl of athole himself a known catholic was the first author of this confederacy the earls of argyle morton mar glencarne the lords boyd lindesey hume semple kirkaldy of grange tullibardine and secretary lidington entered zealously into it the earl of murray foreseeing such turbulent times and being desirous to keep free of these dangerous factions had some time before desired and obtained marys permission to retire into france  insurrections in scotland lord hume was first in arms and leading a body of eight hundred horse suddenly environed the queen of scots and bothwel in the castle of borthwic they found means to make their escape to dunbar while the confederate lords were assembling their troops at edinburgh and taking measures to effectuate their purpose had bothwel been so prudent as to keep within the fortress of dunbar his enemies must have been dissipated for want of pay and subsistence but hearing that the lords were fallen into distress he was so rash as to take the field and advance toward them   th june the armies met at carberry hill about six miles from edinburgh and mary became soon sensible that her own troops disapproved of her cause and were averse to spend their blood in the quarrel keith p  0  spotswood p  0   after some bravadoes of bothwel where he discovered very little courage she saw no resource but that of holding a conference with kirkaldy of grange and of putting herself upon some general promises into the hands of the confederates she was conducted to edinburgh amidst the insults of the populace who reproached her with her crimes and even held before her eyes which ever way she turned a banner on which was painted the murder of her husband and the distress of her infant son melvil p        mary overwhelmed with her calamities had recourse to tears and lamentations meanwhile bothwel during her conference with grange fled unattended to dunbar and fitting out some ships set sail for the orkneys where he subsisted during some time by pyracy he was pursued thither by grange and his ship was taken with several of his servants who afterward discovered all the circumstances of the kings murder and were punished for the crime andon vol ii p         etc  bothwel himself escaped in a boat and found means to get a passage to denmark where he was thrown into prison lost his senses and died miserably about ten years afterward an end worthy of his flagitious conduct and behavior  imprisonment of mary the queen of scots now in the hands of an enraged faction met with such treatment as a sovereign may naturally expect from subjects who have their future ears to provide against as well as their present animosity to gratify it is pretended that she behaved with a spirit very little suitable to her condition avowed her inviolable attachment to bothwel keith p      and even wrote him a letter which the lords intercepted where she declared that she would endure any extremity nay resign her dignity and power rather than relinquish his affections melvil p    the reality of this letter appears somewhat disputable chiely because murray and his associates never mentioned it in their accusation of her before queen elizabeths commissioners  the insurgents finding the danger to which they were exposed in case mary should finally prevail thought themselves obliged to proceed with rigor against her and they sent her next day under a guard to the castle of lochlevin situated in a lake of that name the mistress of the house was mother to the earl of murray and as she pretended to have been lawfully married to the late king of scots she naturally bore an animosity to mary and treated her with the utmost harshness and severity  elizabeth who was exactly informed of all those events seemed touched with compassion toward the unfortunate queen and as all her fears and jealousies were now laid asleep by the consideration of that ruin and infamy in which marys conduct had involved her she began to reflect on the instability of human affairs the precarious state of royal grandeur the danger of encouraging rebellious subjects and she resolved to employ her authority for alleviating the calamities of her unhappy sister she sent sir nicholas throcmorton ambassador to scotland in order to remonstrate both with mary and the associated lords and she gave him instructions which though mixed with some lofty pretensions were full of that good sense which was so natural to her and of that generosity which the present interesting situation had called forth she empowered him to declare in her name to mary that the late conduct of that princess so enormous and in every respect so unjustifiable had given her the highest offense and though she felt the movements of pity toward her she had once determined never to interpose in her affairs either by advice or assistance but to abandon her entirely as a person whose condition was totally desperate and honor irretrieveable that she was well assured that other foreign princes marys near relations had embraced the same resolution but for her part the late events had touched her heart with more tender sympathy and had made her adopt measures more favorable to the liberty and interests of the unhappy queen that she was determined not to see her oppressed by her rebellious subjects but would employ all her good offices and even her power to redeem her from captivity and place her in such a condition as would at once be compatible with her dignity and the safety of her subjects that she entreated her to lay aside all thoughts of revenge except against the murderers of her husband and as she herself was his near relation she was better entitled than the subjects of mary to interpose her authority on that head and she therefore besought that princess if she had any regard to her own honor and safety not to oppose so just and reasonable a demand that after those two points were provided for her own liberty and the punishment of her husbands assassins the safety of her infant son was next to be considered and there seemed no expedient more proper for that purpose than the sending him to be educated in england and that besides the security which would attend his removal from all factions and convulsions there were many other beneficial consequences which it was easy to foresee as the result of his education in that country keith p         etc   the remonstrances which throcmorton was instructed to make to the associated lords were entirely conformable to these sentiments which elizabeth entertained in marys favor she empowered him to tell them that whatever blame she might throw on marys conduct any opposition to their sovereign was totally unjustifiable and incompatible with all order and good government that it belonged not to them to reform much less to punish the maladministration of their prince and the only arms which subjects could in any case lawfully employ against the supreme authority were entreaties councils and representations that if these expedients failed they were next to appeal by their prayers to heaven and to wait with patience till the almighty in whose hands are the hearts of princes should be pleased to turn them to justice and to mercy that she inculcated not this doctrine because she herself was interested in its observance but because it was universally received in all well governed states and was essential to the preservation of civil society that she required them to restore their queen to liberty and promised in that case to concur with them in all proper expedients for regulating the government for punishing the kings murderers and for guarding the life and liberty of the infant prince and that if the services which she had lately conferred on the scottish nation in protecting them from foreign usurpation were duly considered by them they would repose confidence in her good offices and would esteem themselves blameworthy in never having as yet made any application to her ibid              elizabeth besides these remonstrances sent by throcmorton some articles of accommodation which he was to propose to both parties as expedients for the settlement of public affairs and though these articles included some considerable restraints on the sovereign power they were in the main calculated for marys advantage and were sufficiently indulgent to her keith p      the associated lords who were determined to proceed with greater severity were apprehensive of elizabeths partiality and being sensible that mary would take courage from the protection of that powerful princess ibid p      they thought proper after several affected delays to refuse the english ambassador all access to her person there were four different schemes proposed in scotland for the treatment of the captive queen one that she should be restored to her authority under very strict limitations the second that she should be obliged to resign her crown to the prince be banished the kingdom and be confined either to france or england with assurance from the sovereign in whose dominions she should reside that she should make no attempts to the disturbance of the established government the third that she should be publicly tried for her crimes of which her enemies pretended to have undoubted proof and be condemned to perpetual imprisonment the fourth was still more severe and required that after her condemnation capital punishment should be inflicted upon her ibid p   0  throcmorton supported the mildest proposal but though he promised his mistresss guarantee for the performance of articles threatened them with immediate vengeance in case of refusal ibid p     and warned them not to draw on themselves by their violence the public reproach which now lay upon the queen he found that excepting secretary lidington he had not the good fortune to convince any of the leaders all councils seemed to tend toward the more severe expedients and the preachers in particular drawing their examples from the rigorous maxims of the old testament which can only be warranted by particular revelations inflamed the minds of the people against their unhappy sovereign ibid p           there were several pretenders to the regency of the young prince after the intended deposition of mary the earl of lenox claimed that authority as grandfather to the prince the duke of chatelrault who was absent in france had pretensions as next heir to the crown but the greatest number of the associated lords inclined to the earl of murray in whose capacity they had the greatest trust and who possessed the entire confidence of the preachers and more zealous reformers all measures being therefore concerted three instruments were sent to mary by the hands of lord lindesey and sir robert melvil by one of which she was to resign the crown in savor of her son by another to appoint murray regent by the third to name a council which should administer the government till his arrival in scotland the queen of scots seeing no prospect of relief lying justly under apprehensions of her life and believing that no deed which she executed during her captivity could be valid was prevailed on after a plentiful effusion of tears to sign these three instruments and she took not the trouble of inspecting any one of them melvil p    spotswood p     anderson vol iii p     in consequence of this forced resignation the young prince was proclaimed king under the name of james the sixth   th july he was soon after crowned at stirling and the earl of morton took in his name the oath of coronation in which a promise to extirpate heresy was not forgot some republican pretensions in favor of the peoples power were countenanced in this ceremony keith p         and a coin was soon after struck on which the famous saying of trajan was inscribed pro me si merear in me for me if i deserve it against me ibid p   0 appen p   0  throcmorton had orders from his mistress not to assist at the coronation of the king of scots keith p   0   the council of regency had not long occasion to exercise their authority the earl of murray arrived from france and took possession of his high office he paid a visit to the captive queen and spoke to her in a manner which better suited her past conduct than her present condition this harsh treatment quite extinquished in her breast any remains of affection toward him melvil p    keith p      murray proceeded afterward to break in a more public manner all terms of decency with her   th of december he summoned a parliament and that assembly after voting that she was undoubtedly an accomplice in her husbands murder condemned her to imprisonment ratified her dimission of the crown and acknowleged her son for king and murray for regent anderson vol ii p  0  and seq  the regent who was a man of vigor and abilities employed himself successfully in reducing the kingdom he bribed sir james balfour to surrender the castle of edinburgh he constrained the garrison of dunbar to open their gates and he demolished that fortress  but though every thing thus bore a favorable aspect to the new government and all men seemed to submit to murrays authority a violent revolution however necessary can never be effected without great discontents and it was not likely that in a country where the government in its most settled state possessed a very disjointed authority a new establishment should meet with no interruption or disturbance few considerable men of the nation seemed willing to support mary so long as bothwel was present but the removal of that obnoxious nobleman had altered the sentiments of many the duke of chatelrault being disappointed of the regency bore no good will to murray and his counselors and the same sentiments were embraced by all his numerous retainers several of the nobility finding that others had taken the lead among the associators formed a faction apart and opposed the prevailing power and besides some remains of duty and affection toward mary the malecontent lords finding every thing carried to extremity against her were naturally led to embrace her cause and shelter themselves under her authority all those who retained any propensity to the catholic religion were inclined to join this party and even the people in general though they had formerly either detested marys crimes or blamed her imprudence were now moved by her misfortunes to compassionate her present situation and lamented that a person possessed of so many amiable accomplishments joined to such high dignity should be treated with such extreme rigor and severity buchan lib xviii c     animated by all these motives many of the principal nobility now adherents to the queen of scots met at hamilton and concerted measures for supporting the cause of that princess   d may he conveyed her in disguise into a small boat and himself rowed her ashore she hastened to hamilton and the news of her arrival in that place being immediately spread abroad many of the nobility flocked to her with their forces a bond of association for her defense was signed by the earls of argyle huntley eglington crawford cassiles rothes montrose southerland errol nine bishops and nine barons besides many of the most considerable gentry keith p      and in a few days an army to the number of six thousand men was assembled under her standard  elizabeth was no sooner informed of marys escape than she discovered her resolution of persevering in the same generous and friendly measures which she had hitherto pursued if she had not employed force against the regent during the imprisonment of that princess she had been chiefly withheld by the fear of pushing him to greater extremities against her keith p     cabbala p     but she had proposed to the court of france an expedient which though less violent would have been no less effectual for her service she desired that france and england should by concert cut off all commerce with the scotch till they should do justice to their injured sovereign keith p      she now dispatched leighton into scotland to offer both her good offices and the assistance of her force to mary but as she was apprehensive of the entrance of french troops into the kingdom she desired that the controversy between the queen of scots and her subjects might by that princess be referred entirely to her arbitration and that no foreign succors should be introduced into scotland keith p     in the notes anderson vol iv p      but elizabeth had not leizure to exert fully her efforts in favor of mary the regent made haste to assemble forces and notwithstanding that his army was inferior in number to that of the queen of scots he took the field against her   th may a battle was fought at langside near glasgow which was entirely decisive in favor of the associated lords and though the regent after his victory stopped the bloodshed yet was the action followed by a total dispersion of the queens party that unhappy princess fled southwards from the field of battle with great precipitation and came with a few attendants to the borders of england mary flies into england she here deliberated concerning her next measures which would probably prove so important to her future happiness or misery she found it impossible to remain in her own kingdom she had an aversion in her present wretched condition to return into france where she had formerly appeared with so much splendor and was not besides provided of a vessel which could safely convey her thither the late generous behavior of elizabeth made her hope for defense and even assistance from that quarter jebbs collection vol i p   0  and as the present fears of her domestic enemies were the most urgent she overlooked all other considerations and embraced the resolution of taking shelter in england   th may she embarked on board a fishingboat in galloway and landed the same day at wirkington in cumberland about thirty miles distant from carlisle whence she immediately dispatched a messenger to london notifying her arrival desiring liberty to visit elizabeth and craving her protection in consequence of former professions of friendship made her by that princess  elizabeth now found herself in a situation when it was become necessary to take some decisive resolution with regard to her treatment of the queen of scots and as she had hitherto contrary to the opinion of cecil attended more to the motives of generosity than of policy cabala p   0  she was engaged by that prudent minister to weigh anew all the considerations which occurred in this critical conjuncture he represented that the party which had dethroned mary and had at present assumed the government of scotland were always the partisans of the english alliance and were engaged by all the motives of religion and of interest to persevere in their connexions with elizabeth that though murray and his friends might complain of some unkind usage during their banishment in england they would easily forget these grounds of quarrel when they considered that elizabeth was the only ally on whom they could safely depend and that their own queen by her attachment to the catholic faith and by her other connexions excluded them entirely from the friendship of france and even from that of spain that mary on the other hand even before her violent breach with her protestant subjects was in secret entirely governed by the counsels of the house of guise much more would she implicitly comply with their views when by her own misconduct the power of that family and of the zealous catholics was become her sole resource and security that her pretensions to the english crown would render her a very dangerous instrument in their hands and were she once able to suppress the protestants in her own kingdom she would unite the scotch and english catholics with those of all foreign states in one confederacy against the religion and government of england that it behoved elizabeth therefore to proceed with caution in the design of restoring her rival to the throne and to take care both that that enterprise if undertaken should be effected by english forces alone and that full securities should beforehand be provided for the reformers and the reformation in scotland that above all it was requisite to guard carefully the person of that princess lest finding this unexpected reserve in the english friendship she should suddenly take the resolution of flying into france and should attempt by foreign force to recover possession of her authority that her desperate fortunes and broken reputation fitted her for any attempt and her resentment when she should find herself thus deserted by the queen would concur with her ambition and her bigotry and render her an unrelenting as well as powerful enemy to the english government that if she was once abroad in the hands of enterprizing catholics the attack of england would appear to her as easy as that of scotland and the only method she must imagine of recovering her native kingdom would be to acquire that crown to which she would esteem herself equally entitled that a neutrality in such interesting situations though it might be pretended could never without the most extreme danger be upheld by the queen and the detention of mary was equally requisite whether the power of england were to be employed in her favor or against her that nothing indeed was more becoming a great prince than generosity yet the suggestions of this noble principle could never without the utmost imprudence be consulted in such delicate circumstances as those in which the queen was at present placed where her own safety and the interests of her people were intimately concerned in every resolution which she embraced that though the example of successful rebellion especially in a neighboring country could be no wise agreeable to any sovereign yet marys imprudence had been so great perhaps her crimes so enormous that the insurrection of subjects after such provocation could no longer be regarded as a precedent against other princes that it was first necessary for elizabeth to ascertain in a regular and satisfactory manner the extent of marys guilt and thence to determine the degree of protection which she ought to afford her against her discontented subjects that as no glory could surpass that of defending oppressed innocence it was equally infamous to patronize vice and murder on the throne and the contagion of such dishonor would extend itself to all who countenanced or supported it and that if the crimes of the scotch princess should on enquiry appear as great and certain as was affirmed and believed every measure against her which policy should dictate would thence be justified or if she should be found innocent every enterprise which friendship should inspire would be acknowledged laudable and glorious  agreeable to these views elizabeth resolved to proceed in a seemingly friendly but really cautious manner with the queen of scots and she immediately sent orders to lady scrope sister to the duke of norfolk a lady who lived in the neighborhood to attend on that princess soon after she dispatched to her the lord scrope himself warden of the marches and sir francis knolles vice chamberlain they found mary already lodged in the castle of carlisle and after expressing the queens sympathy with her in her late misfortunes they told her that her request of being allowed to visit their sovereign and of being admitted to her presence could not at present be complied with till she had cleared herself of her husbands murder of which she was so strongly accused elizabeth could not without dishonor show her any countenance or appear indifferent to the assassination of so near a kinsman anderson vol iv p                 so unexpected a check threw mary into tears and the necessity of her situation extorted from her a declaration that she would willingly justify herself to her sister from all imputations and would submit her cause to the arbitration of so good a friend ibid p  0        two days after she sent lord herreis to london with a letter to the same purpose  this concession which mary could scarce avoid without an acknowlegement of guilt was the point expected and desired by elizabeth she immediately dispatched midlemore to the regent of scotland requiring him both to desist from the farther prosecution of his queens party and to send some persons to london to justify his conduct with regard to her murray might justly be startled at receiving a message which must have appeared somewhat imperious but as his domestic enemies were numerous and powerful and england was the sole ally which he could expect among foreign nations he was resolved rather to digest the affront than provoke elizabeth by a refusal he also considered that though that queen had hitherto appeared partial to mary her interest evidently engaged her to support the kings cause in scotland and it was not to be doubted but that penetrating princess would in the end discover this advantage and would at least afford him a patient and equitable hearing he therefore replied that he would himself take a journey into england attended with other commissioners and would willingly submit the determination of his cause to elizabeth anderson vol iv p         lord herreis now perceived that his mistress had advanced too far in her concessions he endeavored to maintain that mary could not without diminution of her royal dignity submit to a contest with her rebellious subjects before a foreign prince and he required either present aid from england or liberty for his queen to pass over into france being pressed however with the former agreement before the english council he again renewed his consent but in a few days he began anew to recoil and it was with some difficulty that he was brought to acquiesce in the first determination ibid p    0  these fluctuations which were incessantly renewed showed his visible reluctance to the measures pursued by the court of england  the queen of scots discovered no less aversion to the trial proposed and it required all the artifice and prudence of elizabeth to make her persevere in the agreement to which she had at first consented this latter princess still said to her that she desired not without marys consent and approbation to enter into this question and pretended only as a friend to hear her justification that she was confident there would be found no difficulty in refuting all the calumnies of her enemies and even if her apology should fall short of full conviction elizabeth was determined to support her cause and procure her some reasonable terms of accommodation and that it was never meant that she should be cited to a trial with her rebellious subjects but on the contrary that they should be summoned to appear and justify themselves for their conduct toward her ibid p      allured by these plausible professions the queen of scots agreed to justify herself by her own commissioners before commissioners which should be appointed by elizabeth  during these transactions the lord scrope and sir francis knolles who resided with mary at carlisle had leizure to study her character and to make report of it to elizabeth unbroken by her misfortunes resolute in her purpose active in her enterprises she aspired to nothing but victory and was determined to endure any extremity to undergo any difficulty and to try every fortune rather than abandon her cause or yield the superiority to her enemies eloquent insinuating affable she had already convinced all those who approached her of the innocence of her past conduct and as she declared her fixed purpose to require aid of her friends all over europe and even to have recourse to infidels and barbarians rather than fail of vengeance against her persecutors it was easy to foresee the danger to which her charms her spirit her address if allowed to operate with their full force would expose them anderson vol iv p                   the court of england therefore who under pretense of guarding her had already in effect detained her close prisoner were determined to watch her with still greater vigilance as carlisle by its situation on the borders afforded her great opportunities for contriving her escape they removed her to bolton a seat of lord scropes in yorkshire and the issue of the controversy between her and the scotch nation was regarded as a subject more momentous to elizabeths security and interests than it had ever hitherto been apprehended  conferences at york and hamptoncourt the persons appointed by the english court for the examination of this great cause were the duke of norfolk the earl of sussex and sir ralph sadler and york was named as the place of conference  th october lesley bishop of ross the lords herreis levingstone and boyde with five persons more appeared as commissioners from the queen of scots the earl of murray regent the earl of morton the bishop of orkney lord lindesey and the abbot of dunfermling were appointed commissioners from the king and kingdom of scotland secretary ledington george buchanan the famous poet and historian with some others were named as their assistants  it was a great circumstance of elizabeths glory that she was thus chosen umpire between the factions of a neighboring kingdom which had during many centuries entertained the most violent jealousy and animosity against england and her felicity was equally rare in having the fortune and fame of so dangerous a rival who had long given her the greatest inquietude now entirely at her disposal some circumstances of her late conduct had discovered a bias toward the side of mary her prevailing interests led her to favor the enemies of that princess the professions of impartiality which she had made were open and frequent and she had so far succeeded that each side accused her commissioners of partiality toward their adversaries anderson vol iv part   p  0  she herself appears by the instructions given them to have fixed no plan for the decision but she knew that the advantages which she should reap must be great whatever issue the cause should take if marys crimes could be ascertained by undoubted proof she could for ever blast the reputation of that princess and might justifiably detain her for ever a close prisoner in england if the evidence fell short of conviction it was proposed to restore her to her throne but with such strict limitations as would leave elizabeth perpetual arbiter of all differences between the parties in scotland and render her in effect absolute mistress of that kingdom ibid p       etc goodall vol ii p      marys commissioners before they gave in their complaints against her enemies in scotland entered a protest that their appearance in the cause should no wise affect the independance of her crown or be construed as a mark of subordination to england the english commissioners received this protest but with a reserve to the claim of england the complaint of that princess was next read and contained a detail of all the injuries which she had suffered since her marriage with bothwel that her subjects had taken arms against her under pretense of freeing her from captivity that when she put herself into their hands they had committed her to close custody in lochlevin had crowned her son an infant in her place had again taken arms against her after her delivery from prison had rejected all her proposals for accommodation had given battle to her troops and had obliged her for the safety of her person to take shelter in england anderson vol iv part   p    goodall vol ii p     haynes p   the earl of murray in answer to this complaint gave a summary and imperfect account of the late transactions that the earl of bothwel the known murderer of the late king had a little time after the commission of that crime seized the person of the queen and led her to dunbar that he acquired such influence over her as to gain her consent to marry him and he had accordingly procured a divorce from his former wife and had pretended to celebrate his marriage with the queen that the scandal of this transaction the dishonor which it brought on the whole nation the danger to which the infant prince was exposed from the attempts of that audacious man had obliged the nobility to take arms and oppose his criminal designs and enterprises that after the queen in order to save him had thrown herself into their hands she still discovered such a violent attachment to him that they found it necessary for their own and the public safety to confine her person during a season till bothwel and the other murderers of her husband could be tried and punished for their crimes and that during this confinement she had voluntarily without compulsion or violence merely from disgust at the inquietudes and vexations attending power resigned her crown to her only son and had appointed the earl of murray regent during the minority anderson vol iv part   p    and seq goodall vol ii p      the queens answer to this apology was obvious that she did not know and never could suspect that bothwel who had been acquitted by a jury and recommended to her by all the nobility for her husband was the murderer of the king that she ever was and still continues desirous that if he be guilty he may be brought to condign punishment that her resignation of the crown was extorted from her by the wellgrounded fears of her life and even by the direct menaces of violence and that throcmorton the english ambassador as well as others of her friends had advised her to sign that paper as the only means of saving herself from the last extremity and had assured her that a consent given under these circumstances could never have any force or validity anderson vol iv part   p  0 and seq goodall vol ii p       so far the queen of scots seemed plainly to have the advantage in the contest and the english commissioners might have been surprised that murray had made so weak a defense and had suppressed all the material imputations against that princess on which his party had ever so strenuously insisted had not some private conferences previously informed them of the secret marys commissioners had boasted that elizabeth from regard to her kinswoman and from her desire of maintaining the rights of sovereigns was determined however criminal the conduct of that princess might appear to restore her to the throne anderson vol iv part   p    goodall vol ii p      and murray reflecting on some past measures of the english court began to apprehend that there was but too just grounds for their expectations he believed that mary if he would agree to conceal the most violent part of the accusation against her would submit to any reasonable terms of accommodation but if he once proceeded so far as to charge her with the whole of her supposed guilt no composition could afterward take place and should she ever be restored either by the power of elizabeth or the assistance of her other friends he and his party must be exposed to her most severe and implacable vengeance anderson vol iv part   p       goodall vol ii p      he resolved therefore not to venture rashly on a measure which it would be impossible for him ever to recall and he paid privately a visit to norfolk and the other english commissioners confessed his scruples laid before them the evidences of the queens guilt and desired to have some security for elizabeths protection in case these evidences should upon examination appear entirely satisfactory norfolk was not secretly displeased with these scruples of the regent crawford p    melvil p       haynes p      he had ever been a partizan of the queen of scots secretary ledington who began also to incline to that party and was a man of singular address and capacity had engaged him to embrace farther views in her favor and even to think of espousing her and though that duke confessed anderson vol iv part   p     that the proofs against mary seemed to him unquestionable he encouraged murray in his present resolution not to produce them publicly in the conferences before the english commissioners ibid p       state trials vol i p      norfolk however was obliged to transmit to court the queries proposed by the regent these queries consisted of four particulars whether the english commissioners had authority from their sovereign to pronounce any sentence against mary in case her guilt should be fully proved before them whether they would promise to exercise that authority and proceed to an actual sentence whether the queen of scots if she was found guilty should be delivered into the hands of the regent or at least so secured in england that she never should be able to disturb the tranquillity of scotland and whether elizabeth would also in that case promise to acknowledge the young king and protect the regent in his authority anderson vol iv part   p    goodall vol ii p   0   elizabeth when these queries with the other transactions were laid before her began to think that they pointed toward a conclusion more decisive and more advantageous than she had hitherto expected she was determined therefore to bring the matter into full light and under pretext that the distance from her person retarded the proceedings of her commissioners she ordered them to come to london and there continue the conferences on their appearance she immediately joined in commission with them some of the most considerable of her council sir nicholas bacon lord keeper the earls of arundel and leicester lord clinton admiral and sir william cecil secretary anderson vol iv part   p     the queen of scots who knew nothing of these secret motives and who expected that fear or decency would still restrain murray from proceeding to any violent accusation against her expressed an entire satisfaction in this adjournment and declared that the affair being under the immediate inspection of elizabeth was now in the hands where she most desired it ibid p    goodall vol ii p          the conferences were accordingly continued at hampton court and marys commissioners as before made no scruple to be present at them  the queen meanwhile gave a satisfactory answer to all murrays demands and having declared that though she wished and hoped from the present enquiry to be entirely convinced of marys innocence yet if the event should prove contrary and if that princess should appear guilty of her husbands murder she should for her part esteem her ever after unworthy of a throne goodall vol ii p      the regent encouraged by this declaration opened more fully his charge against the queen of scots and after expressing his reluctance to proceed to that extremity and protesting that nothing but the necessity of selfdefence which must not be abandoned for any delicacy could have engaged him in such a measure he proceeded to accuse her in plain terms of participation and consent in the assassination of the king anderson vol iv part   p     and seq goodall vol ii p  0   the earl of lenox too appeared before the english commissioners and imploring vengeance for the murder of his son accused mary as an accomplice with bothwel in that enormity anderson vol iv part   p     goodall vol ii p  0    when this charge was so unexpectedly given in and copies of it transmitted to the bishop of ross lord herreis and the rest of marys commissioners they absolutely refused to return any answer and they grounded their silence on very extraordinary reasons they had orders they said from their mistress if any thing was advanced that might touch her honor not to make any defense as she was a sovereign princess and could not be subject to any tribunal and they required that she should previously be admitted to elizabeths presence to whom and to whom alone she was determined to justify her innocence anderson vol iv part   p     and seq goodall vol ii              they forgot that the conferences were at first begun and were still continued with no other view than to clear her from the accusations of her enemies that elizabeth had ever pretended to enter into them only as her friend by her own consent and approbation not as assuming any superior jurisdiction over her that that princess had from the beginning refused to admit her to her presence till she should clear herself of the crimes imputed to her that she had therefore discovered no new signs of partiality by her perseverance in that resolution and that though she had granted an audience to the earl of murray and his colleagues she had previously conferred the same honor on marys commissioners lesleys negociations in anderson vol iii p    haynes p      and her conduct was so far entirely equal to both parties  as the queen of scots refused to give in any answer to murrays charge the necessary consequence seemed to be that there could be no farther proceedings in the trial but though this silence might be interpreted as a presumption against her it did not fully answer the purpose of those english ministers who were the enemies of that princess they still desired to have in their hands the proofs of her guilt and in order to draw them with decency from the regent a judicious artifice was employed by elizabeth murray was called before the english commissioners and reproved by them in the queens name for the atrocious imputations which he had had the temerity to throw upon his sovereign but though the earl of murray they added and the other commissioners had so far forgot the duty of allegiance to their prince the queen never would overlook what she owed to her friend her neighbor and her kinswoman and she therefore desired to know what they could say in their own justification anderson vol iv part   p     goodall vol ii p      murray thus urged made no difficulty of producing the proofs of his charge against the queen of scots and among the rest some love letters and sonnets of here is to bothwel wrote all in her own hand and two other papers one wrote in her own hand another signed by her and wrote by the earl of huntley each of which contained a promise of marriage with bothwel  all these important papers had been kept by bothwel in a silver box or casket which had been given him by mary and which had belonged to her first husband francis and though the princess had enjoined him to burn the letters as soon as he had read them he had thought proper to preserve them carefully as pledges of her fidelity and had committed them to the custody of sir james balfour governor of the castle of edinburgh when that fortress was besieged by the associated lords bothwel sent a servant to receive the casket from the hands of the governor balfour delivered it to the messenger but as he had at that time received some disgust from bothwel and was secretly negociating an agreement with the ruling party he took care by conveying private intelligence to the earl of morton to make the papers be intercepted by him they contained incontestible proofs of marys criminal correspondence with bothwel of her consent to the kings murder and of her concurrence in that rape which bothwel pretended to commit upon her anderson vol ii p     goodall vol ii p    murray fortified this evidence by some testimonies of correspondent facts anderson vol ii part   p     etc goodall vol ii p      and he added sometime after the dying confession of one hubert or french paris as he was called a servant of bothwels who had been executed for the kings murder and who directly charged the queen with her being accessory to that criminal enterprise anderson vol ii p     goodall vol ii p      marys commissioners had used every expedient to ward this blow which they saw coming upon them and against which it appears they were not provided in any proper defense as soon as murray opened his charge they endeavored to turn the conferences from an enquiry into a negotiation and though informed by the english commissioners that nothing could be more dishonorable for their mistress than to enter into a treaty with such undutiful subjects before she had justified herself from those enormous imputations which had been thrown upon her they still insisted that elizabeth should settle terms of accommodation between mary and her enemies in scotland anderson vol ii part   p         goodall vol ii p      they maintained that till their mistress had given in her answer to murrays charge his proofs could neither be called for nor produced anderson vol iv part   p         goodall vol ii p      and finding that the english commissioners were still determined to proceed in the method which had been projected they finally broke off the conferences and never would make any reply these papers have all of them been since published the objections made to their validity are in general of small force but were they ever so specious they cannot now be hearkened to since mary at the time when the truth could have been fully cleared did in effect ratify the evidence against her by recoiling from the enquiry at the very critical moment and refusing to give any answer to the accusation of her enemies we shall not enter into a long discussion of the authenticity of these letters we shall only remark in general that the chief objections against them are that they are supposed to have passed through the earl of mortons hands the least scrupulous of all marys enemies and that they are to the last degree indecent and even somewhat inelegant such as it is not likely she would write but to these presumptions we may oppose the following considerations   the it be not difficult to counterfeit a subscription it is very difficult and almost impossible to counterfeit several pages so as to resemble exactly the hand writing of any person   the letters are very long much longer than they needed to have been in order to serve the purposes of marys enemies a circumstance which increased the difficulty and exposed any forgery the more to the risk of a detection   they are not so gross and palpable as forgeries commonly are for they left still a pretext for marys friends to assert that their meaning was strained to make them appear criminal see goodall vol ii p       there is a long contract of marriage said to be wrote by the earl of huntley and signed by the queen before bothwels acquital would morton without any necessity have thus doubled the difficulties of the forgery and the danger of detection   the letters are indiscreet but such was apparently marys conduct at that time they are inelegant but they have a careless natural air like letters hastily wrote between familiar friends   they contain such a variety of particular circumstances as no body could have thought of inventing especially as they must necessarily have asforded her many means of detection   we see that in writing the first and longest letter which she penned late at night her paper failed her and she takes down a memorandum of what she intended to add next morning and it is accordingly added a circumstance very particular and not likely to occur to any person who would forge these letters   we have not the originals of the letters which were in french we have only a scotch and latin translation from the original and a french translation professedly done from the latin now it is remarkable that the scotch translation is full of gallicisms and is clearly a translation from a french original such as make fault fair des fautes make it seem that i believe fair semblant de le crore make brk fair breche this is my first journay cest ma premiere journee have you not desire to laugh navez vous pas envy

mavertir put order to it mettre order a cela discharge your heart decharger votre coeur make good watch faites bon guard etc   there is a conversation which she mentions between herself and the king one evening but murray produced before the english commissioners the testimony of one crawford a gentleman of the earl of lenox who swore that the king on her departure from him gave him an account of the same conversation  0 there seems very little reason why murray and his associates should run the risk of such a dangerous forgery which must have rendered them infamous if detected since their cause from marys known conduct even without these letters was sufficiently good and justifiable    murray exposed these letters to the examination of persons qualified to judge of them the scotch council the scotch parliament queen elizabeth and her council who were possessed of a great number of marys genuine letters    he gave mary herself an opportunity of refuting and exposing him if she had chosen to lay hold of it    the letters tally so well with all the other parts of her conduct during that transaction that these proofs throw the strongest light on each other    the duke of norfolk who had examined these papers and who favored so much queen mary that he intended to marry her and in the end lost his life in her cause yet believed them authentic and was fully convinced of her guilt this appears not only from his letters above mentioned to queen elizabeth and her ministers but by his secret acknowlegement to banister his most trusty confident see state trials vol   p    in the conferences between the duke secretary lidington and the bishop of ross all of them zealous partisans of that princess the same thing seems always to be taken for granted ibid p       see farther ms in the advocates library a      p     from cott lib calig c      i need not repeat the presumption drawn from marys refusal to answer the only excuse for her silence is that the suspected elizabeth to be a partial judge it was not indeed the interest of that princess to acquit and justify her rival and competitor and we accordingly find that lidington from the secret information of the duke of norfolk informed mary by the bishop of ross that the queen of england never meant to come to a decision but only to get into her hands the proofs of marys guilt in order to blast her character see state trials vol   p    but this was a better reason for declining the trial altogether than for breaking it off on frivolous pretenses the very moment the chief accusition was unexpectedly opened against her though she could not expect elizabeths final decision in her favor it was of importance to give a satisfactory answer if she had any to the accusation of the scotch commissioners that answer could have been dispersed for the conviction of the public of toreign nations and of posterity and surely after the accusation and proofs were in queen elizabeths hand it could do no hurt to give in the answers marys information that the queen never inteaded to come to a decision could be no obscle to her justification    the very disappearance of these letters is a presumption of their authenticity that event can be accounted for no way but from the care of king jamess friends who were disirous to destroy every proof of his mothers crimes the disappearance of mortons narrative and of crawfords evidence from the cotton library calig c   must have proceeded from a like cause see ms in the advocates library a      p     i find an objection made to the authenticity of the letters drawn from the vote of the scotch privycouncil which affirms the letters to be wrote and subscribed by queen marys own hand whereas the copies given in to the parliament a few days after were only wrote not subscribed see goodall vol ii p       but it is not considered that this circumstance is of no manner of force there were certainly letters true or false laid before the council and whether the letters were true or false this mistake proceeds equally from the inaccuracy or blunder of the clerk the mistake is easily accounted for the letters were only wrote by her the second contract with bothwel was only subscribed a proper accurate distinction was not made and they are all said to be wrote and subscribed a late writer mr goodall has endeavored to prove that these letters clash with chronology and that the queen was not in the places mentioned in the letters on the days there assigned to confirm this he produces charters and other deeds signed by the queen where the date and place do not agree with the letters but it is well known that the date of charters and such like grants is no proof of the real day in which they were signed by the sovereign papers of that kind commonly pass through different offices the date is affixed by the first office and may precede very long the day of the signature  the account given by morton of the manner in which the papers came into his hands is very natural when he gave it to the english commissioners he had reason to think it would be canvassed with all the severity of able adversaries interested in the highest degree to refute it it is probable that he could have confirmed it by many circumstances and testimonies since they declined the contest  the like observation extends to huberts dying confession it is in vain at present to seek improbabilities in it and to magnify the smallest difficulty into a contradiction it was certainly a regular judicial paper given in regularly and judicially and ought to have been canvassed at the time if the persons whom it concerned had been assured of their own innocence  the sonnets are inelegant insomuch that both brantome and ronsard who knew queen marys style were assured when they saw them that they could not be her composition jebb vol ii p     but no person is equal in his productions especially one whose style is so little formed as marys must be supposed to be not to mention that such dangerous and criminal enterprises leave little tranquillity of mind for elegant poetical compositions  in a word queen mary might easily have conducted the whole conspiracy against her husband without opening her mind to any one person except bothwel and without writing a scrap of paper about it but it was very difficult to have conducted it so as that her conduct should not betray her to men of discernment in the present case her conduct was so gross as to betray her to every body and fortune threw into her enemies hands papers by which they could convict her the same insatuation and imprudence which happily is the usual attendant of great crimes will account for both it is proper to observe that there is not one circumstance of the foregoing narrative contained in the history that is taken from knox buchanan or even thuanus or indeed from any suspected authority     but elizabeth though she had seen enough for her own satisfaction was determined that the most eminent persons of her court should also be acquainted with these transactions and should be convinced of the equity of her proceedings she ordered her privy council to assembled and that she might render the matter more solemn and authentic she added to them the earls of northumberland westmoreland shrewsbury worcester huntingdon and warwic the whole proceedings of the english commissioners were read to them the evidences produced by murray were perused a great number of letters wrote by mary to elizabeth were laid before them and the handwriting compared with that of letters delivered in by the regent the refusal of the queen of scots commissioners to make any reply was related and on the whole elizabeth told them that as she had at first thought it improper that mary after such horrible crimes were imputed to her should be admitted to her presence before she had in some measure justified herself from the charge so now that her guilt was confirmed by so many plausible evidences and all answer denied she must for her part persevere more steadily in that resolution anderson vol iv part   p   0 etc goodall vol ii p      elizabeth next called in the queen of scots commissioners and after observing that she esteemed it much more decent for their mistress to continue the conferences than to require the liberty of justifying herself in person she told them that mary might either send her reply by a person whom she trusted or deliver it herself to some english noblemen whom elizabeth should appoint to wait upon her but as to her resolution of making no reply at all she must regard it as the strongest confession of guilt nor could they ever be esteemed her friends who advised her to that method of proceeding anderson vol iv part   p     etc goodall vol ii p      these topics she enforced still more strongly in a letter which she wrote to mary herself anderson vol iv part   p     goodall vol ii p       the queen of scots had no other subtersuge from these pressing instances than still to demand a personal conference with elizabeth a concession which she was sensible could never be granted cabala p     both because elizabeth knew that that expedient could decide nothing and because it brought matters to extremity which that princess wanted to avoid in order to keep herself better in countenance mary thought of another device even after all the conferences were broke off she ordered her commissioners to accuse the earl of murray and his associates as the murderers of the kind goodall vol ii p   0  but this accusation coming so late being extorted merely by a complaint to murrays and being unsupported by any proof could only be regarded as an angry retaliation upon her enemy unless we take this angry accusation advanced by queen mary to be an argument of murrays guilt there remains not the least presumption which should lead us to suspect him to have been any way an accomplice in the kings murder that queen never pretended to give any proof of the charge and her commissioners affirmed at the time that they themselves knew of none though they were ready to maintain its truth by their mistresss orders and would produce such proof as she should send them it is remarkable that at that time it was impossible for either her or them to produce any proof because the conferences before the english commissioners were previously broke off  it is true the bishop of ross in an angry pamphlet wrote by him under a borrowed name where it is easy to say any thing affirms that lord herreis a few days after the kings death charged murray with the guilt openly to his face at his own table that nobleman as lesly relates the matter affirmed that murray riding in fife with one of his servants the evening before the commission of that crime said to him among other talk this night ere morning the lord darnley shall lose his life see anderson vol i    but this is only hearsay of leslys concerning a hearsay of herreiss and contains a very improbable fact would murray without any use or necessity communicate to a servant such a dangerous and important secret merely by way of conversation we may also observe that lord herreis himself was one of queen marys commissioners who accused murray had he ever heard this story or given credit to it was not that the time to have produced it and not have affirmed as he did that he for his part knew nothing of murrays guilt see goodall vol ii p  0   the earls of huntley and argyle accuse murray of this crime but the reason which they assign is most ridiculous he had given his consent to queen marys divorce from the king therefore he was the kings murderer see anderson vol iv part   p     it is a sure argument that these earls knew no better proof against murray otherwise they would have produced it and not have infilled on so absurd a presumption was not this also the time for huntley to deny his writing marys contract with bothwel if that paper had been a forgery  murray could have no motive to commit that crime the king indeed bore him some ill will but the king himself was become so despicable both from his own illconduct and the queens aversion to him that he could neither do good nor harm to any body to judge by the event in any case is always absurd but more especially in the present the kings murder indeed procured murray the regency but much more queen marys ill conduct and imprudence which he could not possibly foresee and which never would have happened had she been entirely innocent    she also desired to have copies of the papers given in by the regent but as she still persisted in her resolution to make no reply this demand was finally refused her goodall vol ii p       0     haynes vol i p       as mary had thus put an end to the conference the regent expressed great impatience to return into scotland and he complained that his enemies had taken advantage of his absence and had thrown the whole government into confusion elizabeth therefore dismissed him and granted him the loan of five thousand pounds to bear the charges of his journey rymer tom xv p      during the conference at york the duke of chatelrault arrived at london in passing from france and as the queen knew that he was engaged in marys party and had very plausible pretensions to the regency of the king of scots she thought proper to detain him till after murrays departure but notwithstanding these marks of favor and some other assistance which she secretly gave the regent ms in the advocates library a      p           0 from cott lab call c   she still declined acknowleging the young king or treating with murray as regent of scotland  orders were given for removing the queen of scots from bolton a place surrounded with catholics to tutbury in the county of stafford where she was put under the custody of the earl of shrewsbury elizabeth entertained hopes that that princess discouraged by her misfortunes and confounded by the late transactions would be glad to secure a safe retreat from all the tempests with which she had been agitated and she promised to bury every thing in oblivion provided mary would agree either to resign voluntarily her crown or to associate her son with her in the government and the administration to remain during his minority in the hands of the earl of murray goodall vol ii p      but that highspirited princess refused all treaty upon such terms and declared that her last words should be those of a queen of scotland besides many other reasons she said which fixed her in that resolution she knew that if in the present emergence she made such concessions her submission would be universally deemed an acknowlegement of guilt and would ratify all the calumnies of her enemies ibid p  0    mary still insisted upon the alternative of two demands either that elizabeth should in assist her in recovering her authority or should give her liberty to retire into france and make trial of the friendship of other princes and as she asserted that she had come voluntarily into england invited by many former professions of amity she thought that one of these requests could not without the most extreme injustice be refused her but elizabeth sensible of the danger which attended either of these proposals was secretly resolved to detain her still a captive and as her retreat into england had been very little voluntary her claim upon the queens generosity appeared much less urgent than she was willing to pretend necessity it was thought would to the prudent justify her detention her past misconduct would apologize for it to the equitable and though it was foreseen that compassion for her situation joined to her intrigues and insinuating behavior would while she remained in england excite the zeal of her friends especially of the catholics these inconveniences were esteemed much less than those which attended any other expedient elizabeth trusted also to her own address for eluding all those difficulties she proposed to avoid breaking absolutely with the queen of scots to keep her always in hopes of accommodation to negotiate perpetually with her and still to throw the blame of not coming to any conclusion either on unforeseen accidents or on the obstinacy and perverseness of others  we come now to mention some english affairs which we left behind us that we might not interrupt our narration of the events in scotland which form so material a part of the present reign the term fixed by the treaty of cateaucambresis for the restitution of calais expired in      and elizabeth after making her demand at the gates of that city sent sir thomas smith to paris and that minister in conjunction with sir henry norris her ordinary ambassador enforced her pretensions conferences were held on that head without coming to any conclusion the chancellor de lhopital told the english ambassadors that though france by an article of the treaty was obliged to restore calais on the expiration of eight years there was another article of the same treaty which now deprived elizabeth of all right that could accrue to her by that engagement that it was agreed if the english should during that interval commit hostilities upon france they should instantly forfeit all claim to calais and the taking possession of havre and dieppe with whatever pretenses that measure might be covered was a plain violation of the peace between the nations that though these places were not taken by force but put into elizabeths hands by the governors these governors were rebels and a correspondence with such offenders was the most flagrant injury which could be committed to any sovereign that in the treaty which ensued upon the expulsion of the english from normandy the french ministers had absolutely refused to make any mention of calais and had thereby declared their intention to take advantage of the title which had accrued to the crown of france and that though a general clause had been inserted implying a reservation of all claims this concession could not avail the english who at that time possessed no just claim to calais and had previously forfeited all pretensions to that fortress haynes p      the queen was no wise surprised at hearing these allegations and as she knew that the french court intended not from the first to make restitution much less after they could defend their refusal by such plausible reasons she thought it better for the present to submit to the loss than to pursue a doubtful title by a war both dangerous and expensive as well as unseasonable camden p  0    elizabeth entered anew into negotiations for marrying the archduke charles and she seemed at present to have no great motive of policy which might induce her to make this fallacious offer but as she was very rigorous in the terms insisted on and refused him all power and title and even the exercise of his religion in england the treaty came to nothing and that prince despairing of success in his addresses married the daughter of albert duke of bavaria ibid p  0   0    chap iii character of the puritans  duke of norfolks

in this innovation partly from the gradual and slow steps by which the reformation was conducted in that kingdom rage and animosity against the catholic religion was as little indulged as could be supposed in such a revolution the fabric of the secular hierarchy was maintained entire the ancient liturgy was preserved so far as was thought consistent with the new principles many ceremonies become venerable from age and preceding use were retained the splendour of the catholic worship though removed had at least given place to order and decency the distinctive habits of the clergy according to their different ranks were continued no innovation was admitted merely from spite and opposition to the former usage and the new religion by mitigating the genius of the ancient superstition and rendering it more compatible with the peace and interests of society had preserved itself in that happy medium which wise men have always sought and which the people have so seldom been able to maintain  but though such in general was the spirit of the reformation in that country many of the english reformers being men of a more warm complexion and more obstinate temper endeavored to push matters to extremity against the church of rome and indulged themselves in the most violent contrariety and antipathy to all former practices among these hooper who afterward suffered for his religion with such extraord nary constancy was chiefly distinguished this man was named during the reign of edward to the fee of gloucester and had no scruple to accept of the episcopal office but he refused to be consecrated in the episcopal habits the cymarre and rochette which had formerly he said been abused to superstition and which were thereby rendered unbecoming a true christian cranmer and ridley were surprised at this objection which opposed the received practice and even the established laws and though young edward desirous to promote a man so celebrated for his eloquence his zeal and his morals enjoined them to dispense with this ceremony they still continued resolute to retain it hooper then embraced the resolution rather to refuse the bishopric than cloth himself in those hated garments but it was determined that for the sake of the example he should not escape so easily he was first confined to cranmers house and then thrown into prison till he should consent to be a bishop on the terms proposed he was plied with conferences and reprimands and arguments bucer and peter martyr and the most celebrated foreign reformers were consulted on this important question and a compromise with great difficulty was at last made that hooper should not be obliged to wear commonly the obnoxious robes but should agree to be consecrated in them and to use them during cathedral service burnet vol ii p     heylin p  0  a condescension not a little extraordinary in a man of so inflexible a spirit as this reformer  the same objection which had arisen with regard to the episcopal habits had been moved against the raiment of the inferior clergy and the surplice in particular with the tippet and corner cap was a great object of abhorrence to many of the popular zealots strype vol i p      in vain was it urged that particular habits as well as postures and ceremonies being constantly used by the clergy and employed in religious service acquire a veneration in the eyes of the people appear sacred to their apprehensions excite their devotion and contract a kind of mysterious virtue which attaches the affections of men to the national and established worship that in order to produce this effect an uniformity in these particulars is requisite and even a perseverance as far as possible in the former practice and that the nation would be happy if by retaining these inoffensive observances they could engage the people to renounce willingly what was hurtful or pernicious in the ancient superstition these arguments which had influence with wise men were the very reasons which engaged the violent protestants to reject the habits they pushed matters to a total opposition with the church of rome every compliance they said was a symbolizing with antichrist ibid p      and this spirit was carried so far by some reformers that in a national remonstrance which was afterward made by the church of scotland against these habits it was asked what has christ jesus to do with belial what has darkness to do with light if surplices corner caps and tippets have been badges of idolaters in the very act of their idolatry why should the preacher of christian liberty and the open rebuker of all superstition partake with the dregs of the romish beast yea who is there that ought not rather to be afraid of taking in his hand or on his forehead the print and mark of that odious beast keith p     knox p  0   but this application was rejected by the english church  there was only one instance where the spirit of contradiction to the romanists took place universally in england the altar was removed from the wall was placed in the middle of the church and was thenceforth denominated the communion table the reason why this reformation met with such general compliance was that the nobility and gentry got thereby a pretense for making spoil of the plate vestures and rich ornaments which belonged to the altars heylin preface p   hist p  0    these disputes which had been started during the reign of edward were carried abroad by the protestants who fled from the persecutions of mary and as their zeal had received an increase from the furious cruelty of their enemies they were generally inclined to carry their opposition to the utmost extremity against the practices of the church of rome their communication with calvin and the other reformers who followed the discipline and worship of geneva confirmed them farther in this obstinate reluctance and though some of the refugees particularly those established at frankfort still adhered to king edwards liturgy the prevailing spirit carried these confessors to seek a still farther reformation on the accession of elizabeth they returned to their native country and being regarded with general veneration on account of their zeal and past sufferings they ventured to insist on the establishment of their projected model nor did they want countenance from many of the considerable persons in the queens council but the princess herself so far from being willing to despoil religion of the few ornaments and ceremonies which remained in it was of herself rather inclined to bring the public worship still nearer to the romish ritual when nowel one of her chaplains had spoke less reverently in a sermon preached before her of the sign of the cross she called aloud to him from her closet window commanding him to retire from that unlly digression and to return unto his text and on the other side when one of her divines had preached a sermon in defense of the real presence she openly gave him thanks for his pains and piety heylin p     she would have absolutely forbid the marriage of the clergy if cecil had not interposed strypes life of parker p  0   0   0  she was an enemy to sermons and usually said that she thought two or three preachers were sufficient for a whole county  and she thought that the reformation had already gone too far in shaking off those forms and observances which without distracting men of more refined apprehensions tend in a very innocent manner to allure and amuse and engage the vulgar she took care to have a law for uniformity strictly enacted she was empowered by the parliament to add any new ceremonies which she thought proper and though she was sparing in the exercise of this prerogative she continued rigid in exacting an observance of the established laws and in punishing all nonconformity the zealots therefore who harbored a secret antipathy to the episcopal order and to the whole liturgy were obliged in a great measure to conceal these sentiments which would have been regarded as highly audacious and criminal and they confined their avowed objections to the surplice the confirmation of children the sign of the cross in baptism the ring in marriage kneeling at the sacrament and bowing at the name of jesus so fruitless is it for sovereigns to watch with a rigid care over orthodoxy and employ the sword in religious controversy that the work perpetually renewed is perpetually to begin and a garb a gesture nay a metaphysical or grammatical distinction when rendered important by the disputes of theologians and the zeal of the magistrate is sufficient to destroy the unity of the church and even the peace of society these controversies had already excited such ferment among the people that in some places they refused to frequent the churches where the habits and ceremonies were used would not salute the conforming clergy and proceeded so far as to revile them in the streets to spit in their faces and to use them with all manner of contumely strypes life of whitgift p   0  and while the sovereign authority checked these excesses the flame was confined not extinguished and burning fiercer from confinement it burst out in the succeeding reigns to the destruction of the church and monarchy  all enthusiasts indulging themselves in rapturous flights ecstasies visions inspirations have a natural aversion to episcopal authority to ceremonies rites and forms which they denominate superstition or beggarly elements and which seem to restrain the liberal effusions of their zeal and devotion but there was another set of opinions adopted by these innovators which rendered them in a peculiar manner the object of elizabeths aversion the same bold and daring spirit which accompanied them in their addresses to the divinity appeared in their political speculations and the principles of civil liberty which during some reigns had been very little avowed in the nation and which were totally incompatible with the present exorbitant prerogative had been strongly adopted by this new sect scarce any sovereign before elizabeth and none after her carried higher both in speculation and practice the authority of the crown and the puritans so these sectaries were called on account of their pretending to a greater purity of worship and discipline could not recommend themselves worse to her favor than by preaching up the doctrine of resisting or restraining princes from all these motives the queen neglected no opportunity of depressing those zealous innovators and while they were countenanced by some of her most favored ministers cecil leicester knolles bedford walsingham she never was to the end of her life reconciled to their principles and practices  we have thought proper to insert in this place an account of the rise and the genius of the puritans because camden marks the present year as the period when they began to make themselves most considerable in england we now return to our narration  duke of norfolks conspiracy the duke of norfolk was the only peer who enjoyed the highest title of nobility and as there were at present no princes of the blood the splendour of his family the opulence of his fortune and the extent of his influence had rendered him without comparison the first subject in england the qualities of his mind corresponded to his high station beneficent affable generous he had acquired the affections of the people prudent moderate obsequious he possessed without jealousy the good graces of his sovereign his grandfather and father had long been regarded as the leaders of the catholics and this hereditary attachment joined to the alliances of blood had procured him the friendship of the most considerable men of that party but as he had been educated among the reformers was sincerely devoted to their principles and maintained that strict decorum and regularity of life by which the protestants were at that time distinguished he thereby enjoyed the rare felicity of being popular even with the most opposite factions the height of his prosperity alone was the source of his misfortunes and engaged him into attempts from which his virtue and prudence would naturally have for ever kept him at a distance  norfolk was at this time a widower and being of a suitable age to espouse the queen of scots that marriage had appeared so natural that it had occurred to several of his friends and those of that princess but the first person who after secretary lidington opened the scheme to the duke is said to be the earl of murray before his departure for scotland lesley p        that nobleman set before norfolk both the advantage of composing the differences in scotland by an alliance which would be so generally acceptable and the prospect of reaping the succession of england and in order to bind norfolks interest the faster with marys he proposed that the dukes daughter should espouse the young king of scotland the obtaining previously elizabeths consent was regarded both by murray and norfolk as a circumstance essential to the success of their project and all circumstances being adjusted between them murray took care by the means of sir robert melvil to have the design communicated to the queen of scots that princess replied that the vexations which she had met with in her two last marriages had made her more inclined to lead a single life but she was determined to sacrifice her own inclinations to the public welfare and therefore so soon as she should be legally divorced from bothwel she would be determined by the opinion of her nobility and people in the choice of another husband lesley p  0      it is probable that murray was not sincere in this proposal he had two motives to engage him to dissimulation he knew the danger which he must run in his return through the north of england from the power of the earls of northumberland and westmoreland marys partisans in that country and he dreaded an insurrection in scotland from the duke of chatelrault and the earls of argyle and huntley whom she had appointed her lieutenants during her absence by these feigned appearances of friendship he both engaged norfolk to write in his favor to the northern noblemen state trials p        and he persuaded the queen of scots to give her lieutenants permission and even advice to make a cessation of hostilities with the regents party lesley p      the duke of norfolk though he had agreed that elizabeths consent should be previously obtained before the completion of his marriage had good reason to apprehend that he never would prevail with her voluntarily to make that concession he knew her perpetual and unrelenting jealousy against her heir and rival he was acquainted with her former reluctance to all proposals of marriage with the queen of scots he foresaw that that princesss espousing a person of his power and character and interest would give the greatest umbrage and as it would then become necessary to reinstate mary in possession of her throne on some tolerable terms and even endeavor to reestablish her character he dreaded that elizabeth whose politics had now taken a different turn would never agree to such indulgent and generous conditions he therefore endeavored previously to gain the consent and approbation of several of the most considerable nobility and he was successful with the earls of pembroke arundel derby bedford shrewsbury southampton northumberland westmoreland sussex lesley p    camden p     spotswood p   0  the lord lumley and sir nicholas throcmorton embraced cordially the proposal even the earl of leicester elizabeths declared favorite who had formely entertained some views of espousing mary willingly resigned all his pretensions and seemed to enter zealously into norfolks interests haynes p      there were other motives besides affection to the duke which produced this general combination of the nobility  sir william cecil secretary of state was the most vigilant active and prudent minister ever known in england and as he was governed by no views but the interests of his sovereign which he inflexibly pursued his authority over her became every day more predominant ever cool himself and uninfluenced by prejudice or affection he checked those sallies of passion and sometimes of caprice to which she was subject and if he failed of persuading her in the first movement his perseverance and remonstrances and arguments were sure at last to recommend themselves to her sound discernment the more credit he gained with his mistress the more was he exposed to the envy of her other counselors and as he had been supposed to adopt the interests of the house of suffolk whose claim seemed to carry with it no danger to the present establishment his enemies in opposition to him were naturally led to attach themselves to the queen of scots elizabeth saw without uneasiness this emulation among her courtiers which served to augment her authority and though she supported cecil wherever matters came to extremity and dissipated every conspiracy against him particularly one laid about this time to have him thrown into the tower under some pretense or other camden p      she never gave him such unlimited confidence as might enable him entirely to crush his adversaries  norfolk sensible of the difficulty which he must meet with in controling cecils councils especially where they concurred with the inclinations as well as interests of the queen durst not open to her his intentions of marrying the queen of scots but proceeded still in the same course of increasing his interest in the kingdom and engaging more of the nobility to take part in his measures a letter was wrote to mary by leicester and signed by several men of the first rank recommending norfolk for her husband and stipulating conditions for the advantage of both kingdoms that she should give sufficient surety to elizabeth and the heirs of her body for the free enjoyment of the crown of england that a perpetual league offensive and defensive be made between their realms and subjects that the protestant religion be established by law in scotland and that she should grant an amnesty to her rebels in that kingdom lesley p  0 camden p   0 haynes p          when mary returned a favorable answer to this application norfolk applied himself with new ardor to the execution of his project and besides securing the interests of many of the considerable gentry and nobility who resided at court he wrote letters to such as lived at their country seats and possessed the greatest authority in the several counties lesly p     the kings of france and spain who interested themselves extremely in marys cause were secretly consulted and expressed their approbation of these measures ibid p     and though elizabeths consent was always supposed as a previous condition to the finishing this alliance it was apparently norfolks intention when he proceeded such lengths without consulting her to render his party so strong that it should no longer be in her power to refuse it state trials vol i p      it was impossible that so extensive a conspiracy could entirely escape the queens vigilance and that of cecil she dropped several surmises to the duke by which he might learn that she was acquainted with his designs and she frequently warned him to beware on what pillow he reposed his head camden p   0 spotswood p      but he never had the prudence or the courage to open to her his full intentions the first certain intelligence which she received of this dangerous combination was from the earl of murray lesly p    it appears by haynes p         that queen elizabeth had heard rumors of norfolks dealing with murray and charged the latter to inform her of the whole truth which he accordingly did see also the earl of murrays letter produced on norfolks trial  who if ever he was sincere in promoting norfolks marriage which is much to be suspected had at least proposed for his own safety and that of his party that elizabeth should in reality as well as in appearance be entire arbiter of the conditions and should not have her consent extorted by any confederacy of her own subjects this information gave great alarm to the court of england and the more so that those intrigues were attended with other circumstances of which it is probable elizabeth was not wholly ignorant  among the nobility and gentry that seemed to enter into norfolks views there were many who were zealously attached to the catholic religion who had no other design than that of restoring mary to her liberty and who would gladly by a combination with foreign powers or even at the expense of a civil war have placed her on the throne of england the earls of northumberland and westmoreland who possessed great power in the north were leaders of this party and the former nobleman made offer to the queen of scots by leonard dacres brother to lord dacres that he would free her from confinement and convey her to scotland or any other place to which she should think proper to retire lesly p     sir thomas and sir edward stanley sons to the earl of derby sir thomas gerard rolstone and other gentlemen whose interest lay in the neighborhood of the place where mary resided concurred in the same views and required that in order to facilitate the execution of the scheme a diversion should in the mean time be made from the side of flanders lesly p     norfolk discouraged and even in appearance suppressed these conspiracies both because his duty to elizabeth would not allow him to think of effecting his purpose by rebellion and because he foresaw that if the queen of scots came into the possession of these men they would rather choose for her husband the king of spain or some foreign prince who had power as well as inclination to reestablish the catholic religion ibid p      when men of honor and good principles like the duke of norfolk engage in dangerous enterprises they are commonly so unfortunate as to be criminal by halves and while they balance between the execution of their designs and their remorses their fear of punishment and their hope of pardon they render themselves an easy prey to their enemies the duke in order to repress the surmizes spread against him spoke contemptuously to elizabeth of the scotch alliance affirmed that his estate in england was more valuable than the revenue of a kingdom wasted by civil wars and factions and declared that when he amused himself in his own tenniscourt at norwich amidst his friends and vassals he esteemed himself at least a petty prince and was fully contented with his condition camden p   0  finding that he did not convince her by these asseverations and that he was looked on with a jealous eye by the courtiers he retired to his countryseat without taking leave haynes p   he soon after repented of this measure and set out on his return to court with a view of using every expedient to regain the queens good graces but he was met at st albans by fitzgarret lieutenant of the band of pensioners by whom he was conveyed to burnham three miles from windsor where the court then resided ibid p    he was soon after committed to the tower under the custody of sir henry nevil camden p     haynes p   lesley bishop of ross the queen of scotss ambassador was examined and confronted with norfolk before the council lesly p  0  the earl of pembroke was confined to his own house arundel lumley and throcmorton were taken into custody the queen of scots herself was removed to coventry all access to her was during some time more strictly prohibited and the viscount hereford was joined to the earls of shrewsbury and huntingdon in the office of guarding her  insurrections in the north a rumor had been very generally diffused in the north of an intended rebellion and the earl of sussex president of york alarmed with the danger sent for northumberland and westmoreland in order to examine them but not finding any proof against them he allowed them to depart the report meanwhile gained ground daily and many appearances of its reality being discovered orders were dispatched by elizabeth to these two noblemen to appear at court and answer for their conduct haynes p      they had already proceeded so far in their criminal designs that they dared not to trust themselves in her hands they had prepared measures for a rebellion had communicated their design to mary and her ministers ibid p    strype vol ii append p  0 ms in the advocates library from cott lib call c   had entered into a correspondence with the duke of alva governor of the low countries had obtained his promise of a reinforcement of troops and of a supply of arms and ammunition and had prevailed on him to send over to london chiapini vitelli one of his most famous captains under pretense of adjusting some differences with the queen but in reality with a view of putting him at the head of the northern rebels the summons sent to the two earls precipitated the rising before they were fully prepared and northumberland remained in suspense between opposite dangers when he was informed that some of his enemies were on the way with a commission to arrest him he took horse instantly and hastened to his associate westmoreland whom he found surrounded with his friends and vassals and deliberating with regard to the measures which he should follow in the present emergence they determined to begin the insurrection without delay and the great credit of these two noblemen with that zeal for the catholic religion which still prevailed in the neighborhood soon drew together multitudes of the common people they published a manifesto in which they maintained that they intended to attempt nothing against the queen to whom they vowed unshaken allegiance and that their sole aim was to reestablish the religion of their ancestors to remove evil counselors and to restore the duke of norfolk and other faithful peers to their liberty and to the queens favor

most counties expressed an affection for her service cabbala p   0 digges p    and the duke of norfolk himself though he had lost her favor and lay in confinement was not wanting as far as his

head of seven thousand men and found them already advanced to the bishopric of durham of which they had taken possession they retired before him to hexham and hearing that the earl of warwic and lord clinton were advancing upon them with a greater body they found no other expedient but to disperse themselves without striking a blow the common people retired to their houses the leaders fled into scotland northumberland was found skulking in that country and was confined by murray to the castle of lochlevin westmoreland received shelter from the cheiftains of the kers and scots partisans of mary and persuaded them to make an inroad into england with a view of exciting a quarrel between the two kingdoms after they had committed great ravages they retreated to their own country and westmoreland made his escape into flanders where he was protected this sudden and precipitate rebellion was followed soon after by another still more imprudent raised by leonard dacres lord hunsdon at the head of the garrison of berwic was able without other assistance to quell these nfurgents great severity was exercised against the people who had taken part in those rash enterprises sixtysix petty constables were hanged camden p      and no less than eight hundred persons are said on the whole to have suffered by the hands of the executioner lesly p     but the queen was so well pleased with norfolks behavior that she released him from the tower allowed him to live under some show of confinement in his own house and only exacted a promise from him not to proceed any farther in his pretensions to marriage with the queen of scots ibid p  camden p       elizabeth now found that the detention of mary in england was attended with all the ill consequences which she had foreseen when she first embraced that measure this latter princess recovering by means of her misfortunes and her own natural good sense from that delirium in which she seems to have been thrown during her attachment to bothwel had behaved with such modesty and judgment and even dignity that every one who approached her was charmed with her demeanor and her friends were enabled on some plausible grounds to deny the reality of all those crimes which had been imputed to her lesly p  haynes p         the compassion for her situation and the necessity of effecting her relief proved an incitement among all her partisans to be active in promoting her cause and a her delivery from captivity it was thought could no way be effected but by attempts dangerous to the established government elizabeth had reason to expect little tranquillity so long as the scotch queen remained a prisoner in her hands but as this inconvenience had been preferred to the danger of allowing that princess to enjoy her liberty and to seek relief in all the catholic courts of europe it behoved the queen to support the measure which she had adopted and to guard by every prudent expedient against the mischiefs to which it was exposed she still flattered mary with hopes of her protection maintained an ambiguous conduct between that queen and her enemies in scotland negotiated perpetually concerning the terms of her restoration made constant professions of friendship to her and by these artifices endeavored both to prevent her from making any desperate efforts for her delivery and to satisfy the french and spanish ambassadors who never intermitted their solicitations sometimes accompanied with menaces in her favor this deceit was received with the same deceit by the queen of scots professions of confidence were returned by professions equally insincere and while an appearance of friendship was maintained on both sides the animosity and jealousy which had long prevailed between them was every day becoming more inveterate and incurable these two princesses in address capacity activity and spirit were nearly a match for each other but unhappily mary besides her present forlorn condition was always inferior in personal conduct and discretion as well as in power to her illustrious rival  elizabeth and mary wrote at the same time letters to the regent the queen of scots desired that her marriage with bothwel might be examined and a divorce legally pronounced between them the queen of england gave murray the choice of three conditions that mary should be restored to her dignity on certain terms that she should be associated with her son and the administration remain in the regents hands till the young prince should come to years of discretion or that she should be allowed to live at liberty as a private person in scotland and have an honorable settlement made upon her mss in the advocates library a      p     from cott li b al c    murray summoned a convention in order to deliberate on these proposals of the two queens no answer was made by them to marys letter under pretense that she had there maintained the style of a sovereign addressing herself to her subjects but in reality because they saw that her request was calculated to prepare the way for a marriage with norfolk or some powerful prince who could support her cause and restore her to the throne they replied to elizabeth that the two former conditions were so derogatory to the royal authority of their prince that they could not so much as deliberate concerning them the third alone could be the subject of treaty it was evident that elizabeth in proposing conditions so unequal in their importance invited the scotch to a refusal of those which were most advantageous to mary and as it was difficult if not impossible to adjust all the terms of the third so as to render it secure and eligible to all parties it was concluded that she was not sincere in any of them spotswood p   0     lesly p      camden p     lesly p     and as elizabeth found the detention of her in england so dangerous it is probable that she would have been pleased on any honorable or safe terms to rid herself

private injury by a gentleman of the name of hamilton murray was a person of considerable vigor ability and constancy but though he was not unsuccessful during his regency in composing the dissentions in scotland his talents shone out more eminently in the beginning than in the end of his life his manners were rough and austere and he possessed not that perfect integrity which frequently accompanies and can alone atone for that unamiable character  by the death of the regent scotland relapsed into its former anarchy marys party assembled together and made themselves masters of edinburgh the castle commanded by kirkaldy of grange seemed to favor her cause and as many of the principal nobility had embraced that side it became probable though the people were in general averse to her that her authority might again acquire the ascendant to check its progress elizabeth dispatched sussex with an army to the north under color of chastizing the ravages committed by the borderers he entered scotland and laid waste the lands of the kers and scots seized the castle of hume and committed hostilities on all marys partisans who he said had offended his mistress by harboring the english rebels sir william drury was afterward sent with a body of troops and he threw down the houses of the hamiltons who were engaged in the same faction the english armies were afterward recalled by agreement with the queen of scots who promised that no french troops should be introduced into scotland and that the english rebels should by her partisans be delivered up to the queen lesly p      but though the queen covering herself with the pretense of revenging her own quarrel so far contributed to support the party of the young king she was cautious not to declare openly against the queen of scots and sh even sent a request which was equal to a command to the enemies of that princess not to elect during some time a regent in the place of murray spotswood p   0  lenox the kings grandfather was therefore chosen temporary governor under the title of lieutenant hearing afterward that marys partisans instead of delivering up westmoreland and the other fugitives as they had promised had allowed them to escape into flanders she permitted the kings party to give lenox the title of regent ibid p      and she sent randolf as her resident to maintain a correspondence with him but notwithstanding this slep taken in favor of marys enemies she never laid aside her ambiguous conduct or quitted the pretensions of amity to that princess being importuned by the bishop of ross and her other agents as well as by foreign ambassadors she twice procured a suspension of arms between the scotch factions and by that means stopped the hands of the regent who was likely to obtain advantages over the opposite party ibid p      by these seeming contrarieties she kept alive the factions in scotland increased their mutual animosity and rendered the whole country a scene of devastation and of misery crawford p     she had no intention to conquer the kingdom and consequently no interest nor design to instigate the parties against each other but this consequence was an accidental effect of her cautious politics by which she was engaged as far as possible to keep on good terms with the queen of scots and never to violate the appearances of friendship with her at least those of neutrality sir james melvil p  0   0  ascribes to elizabeth a positive design of animating the scotch factions against each other but his evidence is too inconsiderable to counterballance many other authorities and is indeed contrary to her posterior conduct as well as her interests and the necessity of her situation it was plainly her interest that the kings party should prevail and nothing could have engaged her to stop their progress or even forbear from openly assisting them but her intention of still amusing the queen of scots by the hopes of being peaceably restored to her throne see farther strype vol ii appen p  0   the better to amuse mary with the prospect of an accommodation cecil and sir walter mildway were sent to her with proposals from elizabeth the terms were somewhat rigorous such as a captive queen might expect from a jealous rival and they thereby bore the greater appearance of sincerity on the part of the english court it was required that the queen of scots besides renouncing all title to the crown of england during the lifetime of elizabeth should make a perpetual league offensive and defensive between the kingdoms that she should marry no englishman without elizabeths consent nor any other person without the consent of the states of scotland that redress should be made for the late ravages committed in england that justice should be executed on the murderers of the late king that the young prince should be sent into england to be educated there that six hostages all of them noblemen should be delivered to the queen of england with the castle of hume and some other fortress for the security of performance spotswoood p     lesly  0   such were the conditions upon which elizabeth promised to contribute her endeavors toward the restoration of the deposed queen the necessity of marys affairs obliged her to consent to them and the kings of france and spain as well as the pope when consulted by her approved of her conduct chiefly on account of the civil wars by which all europe was at that time agitated and which incapacitated the catholic princes from giving her any assistance lesly p  0  etc   elizabeths commissioners proposed also to mary a plan of accommodation with her subjects in scotland and after some reasoning on that head it was agreed that the queen should require lenox the regent to send up commissioners to treat of conditions under her mediation the partisans of mary boasted that all terms were fully settled with the court of england and that the scotch rebels would soon be constrained to submit to the restoration of their sovereign but elizabeth took care that these rumors should meet with no credit and that the kings party should not be discouraged nor sink too low in their demands cecil wrote to inform the regent that all the queen of englands proposals so far from being fixed and irrevocable were to be discussed anew in the conference and desired him to send commissioners who should be constant to the kings cause and cautious not to make concessions which might be prejudicial to their party spotswood p      sussex also in his letters dropped hints to the same purpose and elizabeth herself said to the abbot of dunfermling whom lenox had sent to the court of england that she would not insist on marys restoration provided the scotch could make the justice of their cause appear to her satisfaction and that even if their reasons should fall short of full conviction she would take effectual care to provide for their future security ibid p            st of march the scotch parliament appointed the earl of morton the abbot of dunfermling and sir james macgill to manage the treaty these commissioners first presented memorials containing reasons for the deposition of their queen and they seconded their arguments with examples drawn from the scotch history with the authority of laws and with the sentiments of many famous divines the losty ideas which elizabeth had entertained of the absolute indesezable right of sovereigns made her be shocked with these republican topics and she told the scotch commissioners that she was nowise satisfied with their reasons for justifying the conduct of their countrymen and that they might therefore proceed to propose the conditions which they required for their security spotswood p          they replied that their commission did not empower them to treat of any terms which might infringe the title and sovereignty of their young king but they would gladly hear whatever proposals should be made them by her majesty the conditions recommended by the queen were not disadvantageous to mary but as the commissioners still insisted that they were not authorized to treat in any manner concerning the restoration of that princess haynes      the conferences were necessarily at an end and elizabeth dismissed the scotch commissioners with injunctions that they should return after having procured more ample powers from their parliament spotswood p       0 etc lesly p         camden p          the bishop of ross complained openly to the english council that they had abused his mistress by fair promises and professions and mary herself was no longer at a loss to judge of elizabeths insincerity by reason of these disappointments matters came still nearer to extremity between the two princesses and the queen of scots finding all her hopes eluded was more strongly incited to make at all hazards every possible attempt for her liberty and security  an incident also happened about this time which tended to widen the breach between mary and elizabeth and to increase the vigilance and jealousy of the latter princess pope pius the fifth who had succeeded paul after having endeavored in vain to conciliate by gentle means the friendship of elizabeth whom his predecessors violence had irritated issued at last a bull of excommunication against her deprived her of all title to the crown and absolved her subjects from their oaths of allegiance camden p      it seems probable that this attack on the queens authority was made in concert with mary who intended by that means to forward the northern rebellion a measure which was at that time projected ibid p     from caietanus life of pus the fifth  john felton affixed this bull to the gates of the bishop of londons palace and scorning either to fly or deny the fact he was seized and condemned and received the crown of martyrdom for which he appears to have entertained so violent an ambition ibid p        d of april a parliament a new parliament after five years interval was assembled at westminster and as the queen by the rage of the pope against her was become still more the head of the ruling party it might be expected both from this incident and from her own prudent and vigorous conduct that her authority over the two houses would be absolutely uncontrouleable it was so in fact yet is it remarkable that it prevailed not without some small opposition and that too arising chiefly from the height of zeal for protestantism a disposition of the english which in general contributed extremely to increase the queens popularity we shall be somewhat particular in relating the transactions of this fession because they show as well the extent of the royal power during that age as the disposition of elizabeth and the genius of her government it will be curious also to observe the faint dawnings of the spirit of liberty in the english the jealousy with which that spirit was repressed by the sovereign the imperious conduct which was maintained in opposition to it and the ease with which it was subdued by this arbitrary princess  the lord keeper bacon after the speaker of the commons was elected told the parliament in the queens name that she enjoined them not to meddle with any matters of state dewes p      such was his expression by which he probably meant the questions of the queens marriage and the succession about which they had before given her some trouble for as to the other great points of government alliances peace and war or foreign negotiations no parliament in that age ever had the presumption to take them under consideration or question in these particulars the conduct of their sovereign  in the former parliament the puritans had introduced seven bills for a farther reformation in religion but they had not been able to prevail in any one of them ibid p      this house of commons had sat a very few days when stricland a member revived one of the bills that for the amendment of the liturgy ibid p          the chief objection which he mentioned was the sign of the cross in baptism another member added the kneeling at the sacrament and remarked that if a posture of humiliation was requisite in that act of devotion it were better that the communicants should throw themselves prostrate on the ground in order to keep at the widest distance from former superstition ibid p       religion was a point of which elizabeth was if possible still more jealous than of matters of state she pretended that in quality of supreme head or governor of the church she was fully empowered by her prerogative alone to decide all questions which might arise with regard to doctrine discipline or worship and she never would allow her parliaments so much as to take these points into consideration dewes p      the courtiers forgot not to insist on this topic the treasurer of the household though he allowed that any heresy might be condemned by parliament a concession which seems to have been very rash and unguarded since the act investing the crown with the supremacy or rather acknowledging that prerogative gave the sovereign full power to reform all heresies yet he affirmed that it belonged to the queen alone as head of the church to regulate every question of ceremony in worship ibid p      the comptroller seconded this argument insisted on the extent of the queens prerogative and said that the house might from former examples have taken warning not to meddle with such matters one pistor opposed these remonstrances of the courtiers he was scandalized he said that affairs of such infinite consequence viz kneeling and making the sign of the cross should be passed over so lightly these questions he added concern the salvation of our souls and interest every one of us more deeply than the monarchy of the whole world this cause he showed to be gods the rest were all but terrene yea trifles in comparison call you them ever so great subsidies crowns kingdoms he knew not what weight they had when laid in the balance with subjects of such unspeakable importance ibid  though the zeal of this member seems to have been highly approved of the house overawed by the prerogative voted upon the question that a petition should be presented to her majesty for her license to proceed farther in this bill and in the mean time to stop all debate or reasoning concerning it ibid p       matters would probably have rested here had not the queen been so highly offended with striclands presumption in moving the bill for reformation of the liturgy that she sent for him to the council and prohibited him thenceforth to appear in the house of commons ibid p      that act of power was too violent even for this submissive parliament to endure carleton took notice of the matter complained that the liberties of the house were violated observed that stricland was not a private man but represented a multitude and moved that he might be sent for and if he was guilty of any offense might answer for it at the bar of the house which he insinuated to be the only competent tribunal ibid  yelverton enforced the principles of liberty with still greater boldness he said that the precedent was dangerous and though in this happy time of lenity among so many good and honorable personages as were at present invested with authority nothing of extremity or injury was to be apprehended yet the times might alter what now is permitted hereafter might be construed as duty and might be enforced even on the ground of the present permission he added that all matters not treasonable or which implied too much derogation of the imperial crown might without offense be introduced into parliament where every question that concerned the community must be considered and where even the right of the crown itself must finally be determined he remarked that men sat not in that house in their private capacities but as elected by their country and though it was proper that the prince should retain his prerogative yet was that prerogative limited by law as the sovereign could not of himself make laws neither could he break them merely from his own authority dewes p           these principles were popular and noble and generous but the open assertion of them was somewhat new in england and the courtiers were more warranted by present practice when they advanced a contrary doctrine the treasurer warned the house to be cautious in their proceedings neither to venture farther than their assured warrant might extend nor hazard their good opinion with her majesty in any doubtful cause the member he said whom they required was not detained on account of any liberty of speech but for the exhibiting a bill in the house against the prerogative of the queen a temerity which was not to be tolerated and he concluded with observing that even speeches made in that house have been questioned and examined by the sovereign ibid p      clear another member remarked that the sovereigns prerogative is not so much as disputable and that the safety of the queen is the safety of the subjects he added that in questions of divinity every man was for his instruction to repair to his ordinary and he seems to imply that the bishops themselves for their instruction must repair to the queen ibid  mr fleetwood observed that in his memory he knew a man who in the fifth of the present queen had been called to account for a speech in the house but left this example should be esteemed too recent he would inform them from the parliament rolls that in the reign of henry the fifth a bishop was committed to prison by the kings command on account of his freedom of speech and the parliament presumed not to go farther than to be humble suitors for him in the subsequent reign the speaker himself was committed with another member and the house found no other remedy than a like submissive application he advised the house to have recourse to the same expedient and not to presume either to send for their member or demand him as of right ibid p     during this speech those members of the council who sat in the house whispered together upon which the speaker moved that the house should make stay of all farther proceedings a motion which was immediately complied with the queen finding that the experiment which she had made was likely to excite a great commotion saved her honor by this silence of the house and that the question might no more be resumed she sent next day to stricland her permission to give his attendance in parliament dewes p       notwithstanding this rebuke from the throne the zeal of the commons still engaged them to continue the discussion of those other bills which regarded religion but they were interrupted by a still more arbitrary proceeding of the queen in which the lords condescended to be her instrument that house sent a message to the commons desiring that a committee might attend them some members were accordingly appointed for that purpose and the upper house informed them that the queens majesty being informed of the articles of reformation which they had canvassed approved of them intended to publish them and to make the bishops execute them by virtue of her regal authority as supreme head of the church of england but that she would not permit them to be treated of in parliament ibid p   0      the house though they did not entirely stop proceedings on account of this injunction seem nowise to have been offended at such haughty treatment and in the issue all their bills came to nothing  a motion made by robert bell a puritan against an exclusive patent granted to a company of merchants at bristol ibid p      gave also occasion to some remarkable incidents the queen some days after the motion was made sent her orders by the mouth of the speaker commanding the house to spend little time in motions and to avoid long speeches all the members understood that she had been offended because a matter had been moved which seemed to touch her prerogative ibid p      fleetwood accordingly spoke of this delicate subject he observed that the queen had a prerogative of granting patents that to question the validity of any patent was to invade the royal prerogative that all foreign trade was entirely subjected to the pleasure of the sovereign that even the statute which gave liberty of commerce admitted of all prohibitions from the crown and that the prince when he granted an exclusive patent only employed the power vested in him and prohibited all others from dealing in any particular branch of commerce he quoted the clerk of the parliaments book to prove that no man might speak in parliament of the statute of wills unless the king first gave license because the royal prerogative in the wards was thereby touched he showed likewise the statutes of edward the first edward the third and henry the fourth with a saving of the prerogative and in edward the sixths time the protector was applied to for his allowance to mention matters of prerogative dewes p   0   sir humphrey gilbert the gallant seaadventurer carried these topics still farther he endeavored to prove the motion made by bell to be a vain device and perilous to be treated of since it tended to the derogation of the prerogative imperial which whoever should attempt so much as in fancy could not he said be otherwise accounted than an open enemy for what difference is there between saying that the queen is not to use the privilege of the crown and saying that she is not queen and though experience has shown so much clemency in her majesty as might perhaps make the subjects forget their duty it is not good to sport or venture too much with princes he remembered them of the fable of the hare who upon the proclamation that all horned beasts should depart the court immediately fled lest his ears should be construed to be horns and by this apologue he seems to insinuate that even those who heard or permitted such dangerous speeches would not themselves be entirely free from danger he desired them to beware lest if they meddled farther with these matters the queen might look to her own power and finding herself able to suppress their challenged liberty and to exert an arbitrary authority might imitate the example of lewis the eleventh of france who as he termed it delivered the crown from wardship ibid p       though this speech gave some disgust no body at the time replied any thing but that sir humphrey mistook the meaning of the house and of the member who made the motion they never had other purpose than to represent their grievances in due and seemly form unto her majesty but in a subsequent debate peter wentworth a man of a superior free spirit called that speech an insult on the house noted sir humphreys disposition to flatter and fawn on the prince compared him to the cameleon which can change itself into all colors except white and recommended to the house a due care of liberty of speech and of the privileges of parliament ibid p      it appears on the whole that the motion against the exclusive patent had no effect bell the member who first introduced it was sent for by the council and was severely reprimanded for his temerity he returned to the house with such an amazed countenance that all the members well informed of the reason were struck with terror and during some time no one durst rise to speak of any matter of importance for fear of giving offense to the queen and the council even after the fears of the commons were somewhat abated the members spoke with extreme precaution and by employing most of their discourse in preambles and apologies they showed their conscious terror of the rod which was hanging over them wherever any delicate point was touched though ever so gently nay seemed to be approached though at ever so great a distance the whisper ran about the house the queen will be offended the council will be extremely displeased and by these surmizes men were warned of the danger to which they exposed themselves it is remarkable that the patent which the queen defended with such imperious violence was contrived for the profit of four courtiers and was attended with the utter ruin of seven or eight thousand of her industrious subjects dewes p         th may thus every thing which passed the two houses was extremely respectful and submissive yet did the queen think it incumbent on her at the conclusion of the session to check and that with great severity those feeble efforts for liberty which had appeared in the motions and speeches of some members the lord keeper told the commons in her majestys name that though the majority of the lower house had showed themselves in their proceedings discreet and dutiful yet a few of them had discovered a contrary character and had justly merited the reproach of audacious arrogant and presumptuous contrary to their duty both as subjects and parliament men nay contrary to the express injunctions given them from the throne at the beginning of the session injunctions which it might well have become them to have better attended to they had presumed to call in question her majestys grants and prerogatives but her majesty warns them that since they will thus wilfully forget themselves they are otherwise to be admonished some other species of correction must be found for them since neither the commands of her majesty nor the example of their wiser brethren can reclaim their audacious arrogant and presumptuous folly by which they are thus led to meddle with what no way belongs to them and what lies not within the compass of their understanding ibid p       in all these transactions appears clearly the opinion which elizabeth had entertained of the duty and authority of parliaments they were not to canvass any matters of state still less were they to meddle with the church questions of either kind were far above their reach and were appropriated to the prince alone or to those councils and ministers with whom he was pleased to entrust them what then was the office of parliaments they might give directions for the due tanning of leather or milling of cloth for the preservation of pheasants and partridges for the reparation of bridges and highways for the punishment of vagabonds or common beggars regulations concerning the police of the country came properly under their inspection and the laws of this kind which they prescribed had if not a greater yet a more durable authority than those derived solely from the proclamations of the sovereign precedents or reports could fix a rule for decisions in private property or the punishment of crimes but no alteration or innovation in the municipal law could proceed from any other source than the parliament nor would the courts of justice be induced to change their established practice by an order of council but the most acceptable part of parliamentary transactions was the granting of subsidies the attainting and punishing the obnoxious nobility or any minister of state after his fall the countenancing such great efforts of power as might be deemed somewhat exceptionable where they proceeded entirely from the sovereign the redress of grievances was sometimes promised to the people but seldom could have place while it was an established rule that the prerogatives of the crown must not be abridged or so much as questioned and examined in parliament even though monopolies and exclusive companies had already reached an enormous height and were every day increasing to the destruction of all liberty and extinction of all industry it was criminal in a member to propose in the most dutiful and regular manner a parliamentary application against any of them  these maxims of government were not kept secret by elizabeth or smoothed over by any fair appearances or plausible pretenses they were openly avowed in her speeches and messages to parliament and were accompanied with all the haughtiness nay sometimes bitterness of expression which the meanest servant could look for from his offended master yet notwithstanding this conduct elizabeth continued the most popular sovereign that ever swayed the scepter of england because the maxims of her reign were conformable to the principles of the times and to the opinion which was generally entertained with regard to the constitution the continued encroachments of popular assemblies on elizabeths successors have so changed our ideas of these matters that the passages above mentioned appear to us extremely curious and even at first surprising but they were so little remarked during the time that neither camden though a contemporary writer nor any other historian has taken any notice of them so absolute was the authority of the crown that the precious spark of liberty had been kindled and was preserved by the puritans alone and it was to this sect whose principles appear so frivolous and habits so ridiculous that the english owe the whole freedom of their constitution actuated by that zeal which belongs to innovators and by the courage which enthusiasm inspires they hazarded the utmost indignation of their sovereign and employing all their industry to be elected into parliament a matter not difficult while a feat was rather regarded as a burden than an advantage it appeared this session that a bribe of four pounds had been given to a mayor for a seat in parliament dewes p     it is probable that the member had no other view but the privilege of being free from arrests  they first acquired a majority in that assembly and then obtained an ascendant over the church and monarchy  the following were the principal laws enacted this session of parliament it was declared treason during the lifetime of the queen to affirm that she was not the lawful sovereign or that any other possessed a better title or that she was an heretic schismatic or infidel or that the laws and statutes cannot limit and determine the right of the crown and the successor thereof to maintain in writing or printing that any person except the natural issue of her body is or ought to be the queens heir or successor subjected the person and all his abettors for the first offense to imprisonment during a year and to the forfeiture of half their goods the second offense subjected them to the penalty of a praemunire   eliz c    this law was plainly leveled against the queen of scots and her partisans and employed an avowal that elizabeth never intended to declare her successor it may be noted that the usual phrase of lawful issue which the parliament thought indecent toward the queen as if she could be supposed to have any other was changed into that of natural issue but this alteration was the source of great ridicule during the time and some persons suspected a deeper design as if leicester intended in case of the queens death to produce some bastard of his own and affirm that he was her offspring camden p       it was also enacted that whosoever by bulls shall publish absolutions or other rescripts of the pope or shall by means of them reconcile any man to the church of rome such offenders as well as those who were so reconciled should be guilty of treason the penalty of a praemunire was imposed on every one who imported any agnus dei crucifix or such other implement of superstition consecrated by the pope    eliz c    the former laws against taking interest which was denominated usury were enforced by a new statute ibid c    a supply of one subsidy and two fifteenths was granted by parliament the queen as she was determined to yield to them none of her power was very cautious of asking from them any supplies she endeavored either by a rigid frugality to make her ordinary revenues suffice for the necessities of the crown or she employed her prerogative and acquired money by the granting of patents monopolies or by some such ruinous expedient  though elizabeth possessed such uncontrouled authority over her parliaments and such extensive influence over her people though during a course of thirteen years she had been able to maintain the public tranquillity which was only interrupted by the hasty and ill concerted insurrection of the north she was still kept in great anxiety and felt her throne perpetually totter under her the violent commotions excited in france and the low countries as well as in scotland seemed in one view to secure her against any disturbance but they served on more reflection to instruct her in the danger of her situation when she remarked that england no less than these neighboring countries contained the seeds of intestine discord the differences of religious opinion and the furious intolerance and animosity of the opposite sectaries  civil wars of france the league formed at bayonne in      for the extermination of the protestants had not been concluded so secretly but intelligence of it had reached conde coligni and the other leaders of the hugonots and finding that the measures of the court agreed with their suspicions they were determined to prevent the cruel perfidy of their enemies and to strike a blow before the catholics were aware of the danger the hugonots though dispersed over the whole kingdom formed a kind of empire within itself and being closely united as well by their religious zeal as by the dangers to which they were perpetually exposed they obeyed with entire submission the orders of their leaders and were ready on every alarm to fly to arms the king and queen mother were living in great security at monceaux in brie when they found themselves surrounded by protestant troops which had secretly marched thither from all quarters and had not a body of swiss come hastily to their relief and conducted them with great intrepidity to paris they must have fallen without resistance into the hands of the insurgents a battle was afterward fought in the plains of st dennis where though the old constable montmorency the general of the catholics was killed combating bravely at the head of his troops the hugonots were finally defeated conde collecting his broken troops and receiving a strong reinforcement from the german protestants appeared again in the field and laying siege to chartres a place of great importance obliged the court to agree to a new accommodation such was the mutual animosity of these religionists that even had the leaders on both sides been ever so sincere in their intentions for peace and reposed ever so great confidence in each other it would have been difficult to have retained the people in tranquillity much more where such extreme jealousy prevailed and where the court employed every pacification as a snare for their enemies a plan was laid for seizing the person of the prince and admiral who narrowly escaped to rochelle and summoned their partisans to their assistance davila lib    the civil wars were renewed with greater fury than ever and the parties became still more exasperated against each other the young duke of anjou brother to the king commanded the forces of the catholics and fought in      a great battle at jarnac with the hugonots where the prince of conde was killed and his army defeated this discomfiture with the loss of so great a leader reduced not the hugonots to despair the admiral still supported the cause and having placed at the head of the protestants the prince of navarre then sixteen years of age and the young prince of conde he encouraged the party rather to perish bravely in the field than ignominiously by the hands of the executioner he collected such numbers so determined to endure every extremity that he was enabled to make head against the duke of anjou and being strengthened by a new reinforcement of germans he obliged that prince to retreat and to divide his forces coligni then laid siege to poitiers and as the eyes of all france were turned on this enterprise the duke of guise emulous of the renown which his father had acquired by the defense of metz threw himself into the place and so animated the garrison by his valor and conduct that the admiral was obliged to raise the siege such was the commencement of that unrivaled fame and grandeur afterward attained by this duke of guise the attachment which all the catholics had borne to his father was immediately transferred to the son and men pleased themselves in comparing all the great and heroic qualities which seemed in a manner hereditary in that family equal in affability in munificence in address in eloquence and in every quality which engages the affections of men equal also in valor in conduct in enterprise in capacity there seemed only this difference between them that the son educated in more turbulent times and finding a greater dissolution of all law and order exceeded the father in ambition and temerity and was engaged in enterprises still more destructive to the authority of his sovereign and to the repose of his native country  elizabeth who kept her attention fixed on the civil commotions of france was no wise pleased with this new rise of her enemies the guises and being anxious for the fate of the protestants whose interests were connected with her own haynes p      she was engaged notwithstanding her aversion against all rebellion and all opposition to the will of the sovereign to give them secretly some assistance besides employing her authority with the german princes she sent money to the queen of navarre and received some jewels as pledges for the loan and she permitted henry champernon to levy and transport over into france a regiment of an hundred gentlemen volunteers among whom walter raleigh then a young man began to distinguish himself in that great school of military valor camden p      the admiral constrained by the impatience of his troops and by the difficulty of subsisting them fought with the duke of anjou the battle of moncontour in poictou where he was wounded and defeated the court of france notwithstanding their frequent experience of the obstinacy of the hugonots and the vigor of coligni vainly flattered themselves that the force of the rebels was at last finally annihilated and they neglected farther preparations against a foe who they thought could never more become dangerous they were surprised to hear that that leader had appeared in another quarter of the kingdom had encouraged the young princes whom he governed to equal constancy had assembled an army had taken the field and was even strong enough to threaten paris the public finances diminished by the continued disorders of the kingdom and wasted by so many fruitless military enterprises could no longer bear the charge of a new armament and the king notwithstanding his extreme animosity against the hugonots was obliged in    0 to conclude an accommodation with them to grant them a pardon for all past offenses and to renew the edicts for liberty of conscience  though a pacification was seemingly concluded the mind of charles was no way reconciled to his rebellious subjects and this accommodation like all the foregoing was nothing but a snare by which the perfidious court had projected to destroy at once without danger all its formidable enemies as the two young princes the admiral and all the leaders of the hugonots instructed by past experience discovered an extreme distrust of the kings intentions and kept themselves in security at a distance all possible artifices were employed to remove their apprehensions and convince them of the sincerity of the new councils which seemed to be embraced the terms of the peace were exactly observed to them the toleration was regularly maintained all attempts made by the zealous catholics to infringe it were punished with severity offices and favors and honors were bestowed on the principal nobility among the protestants and the king and council every where declared that tired of civil disorders and convinced of the impossibility of forcing mens conscience they were thenceforth determined to allow every one the free exercise of his religion  among the other artifices employed to ull the protestants into a fatal security charles assected to enter into close connexions with elizabeth and as it seemed not the interest of france to forward the union of the two kingdoms of great britain that princess the more easily flattered herself that the french monarch would prefer her friendship to that of the queen of scots the better to deceive her proposals of marriage were made her with the duke of anjou a prince whose youth beauty and reputation for valor might naturally be supposed to recommend him to a woman who had appeared not altogether indifferent to these endowments the queen immediately founded on this offer the project of deceiving the court of france and being intent on the artifice of that scheme she laid herself the more open to be deceived negotiations were entered into with regard to the marriage terms of the contract were proposed difficulties started and removed and the two courts equally insincere though not equally criminal seemed to approach every day nearer each other in their demands and concessions the great obstacle seemed to lie in adjusting the differences of religion because elizabeth who recommended toleration to charles was determined not to grant it in her own dominions not even to her husband and the duke of anjou seemed unwilling to submit for the sake of interest to the dishonor of an apostasy camden p     davila lib   diggess complete ambassador p     0        the artificial politics of elizabeth never triumphed so much in any contivances as in those which were conjoined with her coquetry and as her character in this particular was generally known the court of france thought that they might without danger of forming any final conclusion venture the farther in their concessions and offers to her the queen also had other motives for dissimulation besides the advantage of discouraging marys partisans by the prospect of an alliance between france and england her situation with philip demanded her utmost vigilance and attention and the present revolutions in the low countries made her glad of fortifying herself even with the appearance of a new confederacy  affairs of the low countries the theological controversies which had long agitated europe had from the beginning penetrated into the low countries and as these provinces maintained a very extensive commerce they had early received from every kingdom with which they corresponded a tincture of religious innovation an opinion at that time prevailed which had been zealously propagated by the priests and implicitly received by sovereigns that heresy was closely connected with rebellion and that every great or violent alteration in the church involved a like revolution in the state and civil government the forward zeal of the reformers would seldom allow them to wait the consent of the magistrate to their innovations they became less dutiful when they were opposed and persecuted and though their pretended spirit of reasoning and enquiry was in reality nothing but a new species of implicit faith the prince took the alarm as if no institutions could be secure from the temerity of their researches the emperor charles who proposed to augment his authority under the pretense of defending the catholic faith easily adopted these political principles and notwithstanding the limited prerogative which he possessed in the netherlands he published the most arbitrary severe and tyrannical edicts against the protestants and he took care that the execution of them should be no less violent and sanguinary he was neither cruel nor bigoted in his natural disposition yet an historian celebrated for moderation and caution has computed that in the several persecutions promoted by that monarch no less than an hundred thousand persons perished by the hands of the executioner grotii annal lib   father paul another great authority computes in a passag above  that  0000 persons were put to death in the low countries alone  but these severe remedies so far from answering the purpose intended had rather served to augment the numbers as well as zeal of the reformers and the magistrates of the several towns seeing no end of those barbarous executions felt their humanity rebel against their principles and declined any farther persecution of the new doctrines  when philip succeeded to his fathers dominions the flemings were justly alarmed with new apprehensions lest their prince observing the lenity of the magistrates should take the execution of the edicts from such remiss hands and establish the inquisition in the low countries accompanied with all the iniquities and barbarities which attended it in spain the severe and unrelenting character of the man his professed attachment to spanish manners the inflexible bigotry of his principles all these circumstances increased their terror and when he left the netherlands with a known intention never to return the disgust of the inhabitants was extremely augmented and their dread of those tyrannical orders which their sovereign surrounded with spanish ministers would issue from his cabinet of madrid he left the duchess of parma governess of the low countries and the natural good sense and good temper of that princess had she been entrusted with the sole power would have preserved the submission of those opulent provinces which were lost from that refinement of treacherous and barbarous politics on which philip so highly valued himself the flemings ound that the name alone of regent remained with the duchess that cardinal granville possessed entirely the kings confidence that attempts were every day made on their liberties that a resolution was taken never more to assemble the sates that new bishoprics were arbitrarily elected in order to enforce the execution of the persecuting edicts and that on the whole they must make account of being reduced to the condition of a province under the spanish monarchy the discontents of the nobility gave countenance to the complaints of the gentry which encouraged the mutiny of the populace and all orders of men showed a strong disposition to revolt associations were formed tumultuary petitions presented names of distinction assumed badges of party displayed and the current of the people irritated by feeble resistance and impelled by religious zeal rose to such a height that in several towns particularly in antwerp they made an open invasion on the established worship pillaged the churches and monasteries broke the images and committed the most unwarrantable disorders  the wiser part of the nobility particularly the prince of orange and the counts egmont and horn were alarmed with these excesses to which their discontents had at first given countenance and seconding the wisdom of the governess they suppressed those dangerous insurrections punished the ringleaders and reduced all the provinces to a state of order and submission but philip was not contented with the reestablishment of his ancient authority he considered that provinces so remote from the seat of government could not be ruled by a limited prerogative and that a prince who must entreat rather than command would necessarily when he resided not among the people feel every day a diminution of his power and influence he was determined therefore to lay hold of the late popular mutinies as a pretense for abolishing entirely the privileges of the low country provinces and for ruling them thenceforth with a military and arbitrary authority in the execution of this violent design he employed a man who was a proper instrument in the hands of such a tyrant ferdinand of toledo duke of alva had been educated entirely amidst arms and having attained a consummate knowledge in the military art his habits led him to transfer into all government the severe discipline of a camp and to conceive no measures between prince and subject but those of rigid command and implicit obedience this general in      conducted from italy to the low countries a powerful body of veteran spaniards and his avowed animosity to the flemings with his known character struck that whole people with terror and consternation it belongs not to our subject to relate at length those violences which alvas natural barbarity steeled by reflection and aggravated by insolence exercised on those flourishing provinces it suffices to say that all their privileges the gift of so many princes and the inheritance of so many ages were openly and expressly abolished by edict arbitrary and sanguinary tribunals erected the counts fgmont and horn notwithstanding their great merits and past services brought to the scaffold multitudes of all ranks thrown into prion and thence delivered over to the executioner and notwithstanding the peaceable submission of all men nothing was heard of but confiscation imprisonment exile torture and death  elizabeth was equally displeased to see the progress of that scheme laid for the extermination of the protestants and to observe the erection of so great a military power in a state situated so near her she gave protection to all the flemish exiles who took shelter in her dominions and as many of these were the most industrious inhabitants of the netherlands and had rendered that country so celebrated for its arts she reaped the advantage of introducing into england some useful manufactures which were formerly unknown in that kingdom foreseeing that the violent government of alva could not long subsist without exciting some commotion she ventured to commit an insult upon him which she would have been cautious not to hazard against a more established authority some genoese merchants had engaged by contract with philip to transport into flanders the sum of four hundred thousand crowns and the vessels in which this money was embarked had been attacked in the channel by some privateers equiped by the french hugonots and had taken shelter in plymouth and southampton the commanders of the ships pretended that the money belonged to the king of spain but the queen finding upon enquiry that it was the property of genoese merchants took possession of it as a loan and by that means deprived the duke of alva of this resource in the time of his greatest necessity alva in revenge seized all the english merchants in the low countries threw them into prison and confiscated their effects the queen retaliated by a like violence on the flemish and spanish merchants and gave all the english liberty to make reprizals on the subjects of philip these differences were afterward accommodated by treaty and mutual reparations were made to the merchants but nothing could repair the loss which so welltimed a blow inflicted on the spanish government in the low countries alva in want of money and dreading the immediate mutiny of his troops to whom large arrears were due imposed by his arbitrary will the most ruinous taxes on the people he not only required the hundredth penny and the twentieth of all immovable goods he also demanded the tenth of all moveable goods on every sale an absurd tyranny which would not only have destroyed all arts and commerce but even have restrained the common intercourse of life the people refused compliance the duke had recourse to his usual expedient of hanging and thus matters came still nearer the last extremity between the flemings and the spaniards bentivoglio part i lib v camden p       all the enemies of elizabeth in order to revenge themselves for her insul had naturally recourse to one expedient the supporting the cause and prtensions of the queen of scots and alva whose measures were ever violent soon opened a secret intercourse with that princess new conspiracy of the duke of norfolk there was one radolphi a florentine merchant who had resided about fifteen years at london and who at the same time that he conducted his commerce in england had managed all the intrigues of the court of rome with the catholic nobility and gentry lesley p     state trials vol i p     he had been thrown into prison at the time when the duke of norfolks intrigues with mary were discovered but either no proof was found against him or the part which he had acted was not very criminal and he soon after recovered his liberty this man zealous for promoting the catholic faith had formed a scheme in concert with the spanish ambassador for subverting the government by a foreign invasion and a domestic insurrection and when he communicated his project by letter to mary he found that as she was now fully convinced of elizabeths artifices and despaired of ever recovering her authority or even her liberty by pacific measures she very willingly gave her concurrence the great number of discontented catholics were the chief source of their hopes on the side of england and they also observed that the kingdom was at that time full of indigent gentry chiefly younger brothers who having at present by the late decay of the church and the yet languishing state of commerce no prospect of a livelihood suitable to their birth were ready to throw themselves into any desperate enterprise lesley p      but in order to inspire spirit and courage into all these malcontents it was requisite that some great nobleman should put himself at their head and no one appeared to rodolphi and to the bishop of ross who entered into all these intrigues so proper both on account of his power and his popularity as the duke of norfolk  this nobleman when released from confinement in the tower had given his promise that he would drop all intercourse with the queen of scots haynes p      but finding that he had lost and as he feared beyond all recovery the confidence and favor of elizabeth and being still in some degree restrained from his liberty he was tempted by impatience and despair to violate his word and to open anew his correspondence with the captive princess state trials vol i p  0   a promise of marriage was renewed between them the duke engaged to enter into all her interests and as his remorses gradually decayed in the course of these transactions he was pushed to give his assent to enterprises still more criminal rodolphis plan was that the duke of alva should under some other pretense assemble a great quantity of shipping in the low countries should transport a body of six thousand foot and four thousand horse into england should land them at harwich where the duke of norfolk was to join them with all his friends should thence march directly to london and oblige the queen to submit to whatever conditions the conspirators should please to impose upon her lesley p     state trials vol i p        norfolk gave his consent to this plan and three letters in consequence of it were wrote in his name by rodolphi to alva the pope and the king of spain but the duke apprehensive of the danger refused to sign them lesley p         camden p      he only sent to the spanish ambassador a servant and confident named barker as well to notify his concurrence in the plan as to vouch the authenticity of these letters and rodolphi having obtained a letter of credence from the ambassador proceeded on his journey to brussels and to rome the duke of alva and the pope embraced the scheme with alacrity rodolphi informed norfolk of their intentions state trials vol i p     and every thing seemed to concur in forwarding the undertaking  norfolk notwithstanding these criminal enterprises had never entirely forgot his duty to his sovereign his country and his religion and though he had laid the plan both for an invasion and an insurrection he still flattered himself that the innocence of his intentions would justify the violence of his measures and that as he aimed at nothing but the liberty of the queen of scots and the obtaining elizabeths consent to his marriage he could not justly reproach himself as a rebel and a traitor lesley p     it is certain however that considering the queens vigor and spirit the scheme if successful must finally have ended in her dethronement and her authority was here exposed to the utmost danger the conspiracy had hitherto entirely escaped the vigilance of elizabeth and that of secretary cecil who now bore the title of lord burleigh it was from another attempt of norfolk that they first obtained a hint which being diligently traced led at last to a full discovery mary had intended to send a sum of money to lord herreis and her partisans in scotland and norfolk undertook to have it conveyed to bannister a servant of his at that time in the north who was to find some expedient to have it delivered to lord herreis ibid p     state trials vol i p    camden p     digges p

servant conjecturing from the weight and size of the bag that it was full of gold carried the letter to burleigh who immediately ordered bannister barker and hicford the dukes secretary to be put under arrest and to undergo a severe examination the fear of torture made them confess the whole truth and as hicford though ordered to burn all papers had carefully kept them concealed under the mats of the dukes chamber and under the tiles of the house full evidence now appeared against his master lesley p      norfolk himself who was entirely ignorant of the discoveries made by his servants was brought before the council and though exhorted to atone for his guilt by a full confession he persisted in denying every accusation with which he was charged the queen always declared that if he had given her this proof of his sincere repentance she would have pardoned all his former offenses ibid p      but finding him obstinate she committed him to the tower and ordered him to be brought to his trial the bishop of ross had on some suspicion been committed to custody before the discovery of norfolks guilt and every expedient was employed to make him reveal his share in the conspiracy he at first insisted on his privilege as an ambassador but he was told that as his mistress was no longer a sovereign he would not be regarded as an ambassador and that even if that character was allowed it did not warrant him in conspiring against the sovereign in whose court he resided ibid p     spotswood  as he still refused to answer interrogatories he was informed of the confession made by norfolks servants after which he entertained no longer any scruple to make a full discovery and his evidence put the guilt of that nobleman beyond all question    january trial of norfolk a jury of twentyfive peers unanimously passed sentence upon him the trial was quite regular even according to the strict rules observed at present in these matters except that the witnesses gave not their evidence in court and were not confronted with the criminal a laudable practice which was not at that time observed in trials for high treason  the queen still hesitated concerning norfolks execution whether that she was really moved by friendship and compassion toward a peer of that rank and merit or that affecting the praise of clemency she only put on the appearance of these sentiments his execution twice she signed a warrant for his execution and twice revoked the fatal sentence carte p     from fenelons dispatches digges p     strype vol ii p     and though her ministers and counselors pushed her to rigor she still appeared irresolute and undetermined   may after four months hesitation a parliament was assembled and the commons addressed her in very strong terms for the execution of the duke a sanction which when added to the greatness and certainty of his guilt would she thought justify in the eyes of all the world her severity against that nobleman   june norfolk died with great calmness and constancy and though he cleared himself of any disloyal intentions against the queens authority he acknowleged the justice of the sentence by which he suffered camden p   0 strype vol ii app p     that we may relate together affairs of a like nature we shall mention that the earl of northumberland being delivered up to the queen by the regent of scotland was also a few months after brought to the scaffold for his rebellion  the queen of scots was either the occasion or the cause of all these disturbances but as she was a sovereign princess and might reasonably from the harsh treatment which she had met with think herself entitled to use any expedient for her relief elizabeth durst not as yet form any resolution of proceeding to extremity against her she only sent lord delawar sir ralph sadler sir thomas bromley and dr wilson to expostulate with her and to require satisfaction for all those parts of her conduct which from the beginning of her life had given exception to elizabeth her assuming the arms of england refusing to ratify the treaty of edinburgh her intending to marry norfolk without the queens consent her concurring in the northern rebellion digges p     0

others camden p      but the queen was little satisfied with her apology and the parliament was so enraged against her that the commons made a direct application for her immediate trial and execution they employed some topics derived from practice and reason and the laws of nations but the chief stress was laid on passages and examples from the old testament dewes p  0   0  etc  which if considered as a general rule of conduct an intention which it is unreasonable to suppose would imply consequences dangerous to all the principles of humanity and morality matters were here carried to greater extremity than elizabeth intended and being satisfied with showing mary the disposition of the nation she sent to the house her express commands not to deal any farther at present in the affair of the scottish queen ibid p          nothing could be a stronger proof that the puritanical interest prevailed in the house than the intemperate use of authorities derived from scripture especially from the old testament and the queen was so little a lover of that sect that she was not likely to make any concession merely in deference to their solicitation she showed this session her disapprobation of their schemes in another remarkable instance there had passed in the lower house two bills for regulating ecclesiastical ceremonies but she sent them a like imperious message with the foregoing and by the terror of her prerogative stopped all farther proceedings dewes p           but though elizabeth would not proceed to such extremities against mary as were recommended to her by the parliament she was alarmed with the great interest and the restless spirit of that princess as well as her close connections with spain and she thought it necessary both to increase the rigor and strictness of her confinement and to follow maxims different from what she had hitherto pursued in her management of scotland digges p      scotch affairs that kingdom remained still in a state of anarchy the castle of edinburgh commanded by kirkaldy of grange had declared for the queen and the lords of that party encouraged by his countenance had taken possession of the capital and carried on a vigorous war against the regent by a sudden and unexpected inroad they seized that nobleman at stirling but finding that his friends sallying from the castle were likely to relieve him they instantly put him to death the earl of mar was chosen regent in his place and found the same difficulties to encounter in the government of that divided country he was therefore glad to accept of the mediation of the french and english ambassadors and to conclude on equal terms a truce with the queens party spotswood p      he was a man of a free and generous spirit and scorned to submit to any dependence on england and for this reason elizabeth who had formed close connections with france yielded with less reluctance to the solicitations of that court still maintained the appearance of neutrality between the parties and allowed matters to remain on a balance in scotland digges p              but affairs soon after took a new turn mar died of melancholy with which the distracted state of the country affected him morton was chosen regent and as this nobleman had secretly taken all his measures with elizabeth who no longer relied on the friendship of the french court she resolved to exert herself more effectually for the support of that party whom she had always favored she sent sir henry killigrew ambassador into scotland who found marys partisans so discouraged by the discovery and punishment of norfolks conspiracy that they were glad to submit to the kings authority and accept of an indemnity for all past offenses spotswood p      the duke of chatelrault and the earl of huntley with the most considerable of marys friends laid down their arms on these conditions the garrison alone of the castle of edinburgh continued refractory kirkaldys fortunes were desperate and he flattered himself with assistance from the kings of france and spain who encouraged his obstinacy in hopes of being able from that quarter to give disturbance to england elizabeth was alarmed with the danger she no more apprehended the coming to extremity with the queen of scots who she found could not any longer be amused by her artifices she had an entire reliance on morton and she saw that by the submission of all the considerable nobility the pacification of scotland would be an easy as well as a most important undertaking she therefore ordered sir william drury governor of berwic to march with some troops and artillery to edinburgh and to besiege the castle camden p      the garrison submitted at discretion kirkaldy was delivered to his countrymen by whom he was tried and executed secretary lidington who had taken part with him died soon after a voluntary death as is supposed and scotland submitting entirely to the regent gave not during a long time any farther inquietude to elizabeth  french affairs the events which happened in france were not so agreeable to the queens interests and inclinations the fallacious pacifications which had been so often made with the hugonots gave them good reason to suspect the present intentions of the court and after all the other leaders of that party were deceived into a dangerous credulity the sagacious admiral still remained doubtful and uncertain but his suspicions were at last overcome partly by the profound dissimulation of charles partly by his own earnest desire to end the miseries of france and return again to the performance of his duty toward his prince and country he considered besides that as the former violent conduct of the court had ever met with such fatal success it was not unlikely that a prince who had newly come to years of discretion and was not rivetted in any dangerous animosities or prejudices would be induced to govern himself by more moderate maxims and as charles was young was of a passionate hasty temper and addicted to pleasure digges p       such deep perfidy seemed either remote from his character or difficult and almost impossible to be so uniformly supported by him moved by these considerations the admiral the queen of navarre and all the hugonots began to repose themselves in full security and gave credit to the treacherous caresses and professions of the french court elizabeth herself notwithstanding her great experience and penetration entertained not the least mistrust of charless sincerity and being pleased to find her enemies of the house of guise removed from all authority and to observe an animosity every day growing between the french and spanish monarchs   th april she concluded a defensive league with the former camden p      and regarded this alliance as an invincible barrier to her throne walsingham her ambassador sent her over by every courier the most satisfying accounts of the honor and plaindealing and fidelity of that perfidious prince  the better to blind the eyes of the jealous hugonots and draw their leaders into the snare prepared for them charles offered his sister margaret in marriage to the prince of navarre and the admiral with all the considerable nobility of that party had come to paris in order to assist at the celebration of these nuptials which it was hoped would finally if not compose the differences at least appease the bloody animosity of the two religions the queen of navarre was poisoned by orders from the court the admiral was dangerously wounded by an assassin    august yet charles by redoubling his dissimulation was still able to retain the hugonots in their security massacre of paris till on the evening of st bartholomew the day of the marriage the signal was given for a general massacre of these religionists and the king himself in person led the way to these assassinations the hatred long entertained by the parisians against the protestants made them second without any preparation the fury of the court and all conditions ages and sexes suspected of any propensity to that religion were involved in an undistinguished ruin the admiral his soninlaw teligni soubize rochefoucaut pardaillon piles lavardin men who during the late wars had distinguished themselves by the most heroic actions were miserably butchered without resistance the streets of paris flowed with blood and the populace more enraged than satiated with their cruelty as if repining that death had saved the victims from farther insult exercised on their dead bodies all the rage of the most licentious brutality about five hundred gentlemen and men of rank perished in this massacre and near ten thousand of inferior condition davila lib v  orders were suddenly dispatched to all the provinces for a like general execution of the protestants and in rouen lions and many other cities the people emulated the fury of the capital even the murder of the king of navarre and the prince of conde had been proposed by the duke of guise but charles softened by the amiable manners of the king of navarre and hoping that these young princes might easily be converted to the catholic faith was determined to spare their lives though he obliged them to purchase their safety by a seeming change of their religion  charles in order to cover this barbarous perfidy pretended that a conspiracy of the hugonots to seize his person had been suddenly discovered and that he had been necessitated for his own defense to proceed to this severity against them he sent orders to fenelon his ambassador in england to ask an audience and to give elizabeth this account of the late transaction that minister who was a man of probity abhorred the treachery and cruelty of his court and even scrupled not to declare that he was now ashamed to bear the name of a frenchman digges p      yet was he obliged to obey his orders and make use of the apology which had been prescribed to him he met with that reception from all the courtiers which he knew the conduct of his master had so well merited nothing could be more awful and affecting than the solemnity of his audience a melancholy sorrow sat on every face silence as in the dead of night reigned through all the chambers of the royal apartment the courtiers and ladies clad in deep mourning were ranged on each side and allowed him to pass without affording him one salute or favorable look till he was admitted to the queen herself carte vol iii p     from fenelons dispatches  that princess received him with a more easy if not a more gracious countenance and heard his apology without discovering any visible symptoms of indignation she told him that though on the first rumor of this dreadful intelligence she had been astonished that so many brave men and loyal subjects who rested secure on the faith of their sovereign should have been suddenly butchered in so barbarous a manner she had hitherto suspended her judgment till farther and more certain information should be brought her that the account which he had given even if founded on no mistake or bad information though it might alleviate would by no means remove the blame of the kings counselors or justify the strange irregularity of their proceedings that the same force which without resistance had massacred so many defenseless men could easily have secured their persons and have reserved them for a trial and for punishment by a formal sentence which would have distinguished the innocent from the guilty that the admiral in particular being dangerously wounded and environed by the guards of the king on whose protection he seemed entirely to rely had no means of escape and might surely before his death have been convicted of the crimes imputed to him that it was more worthy of a sovereign to reserve in his own hands the sword of justice than to commit it to bloody murderers who being the declared and mortal enemies of the persons accused employed it without mercy and without distinction that if these sentiments were just even supposing the conspiracy of the protestants to be real how much more if that crime was nothing but a calumny of their enemies invented for their ruin and destruction that if upon enquiry the innocence of these unhappy victims should afterward appear it was the kings duty to turn his vengeance on their enemies and calumniators who had thus cruelly abused his confidence had murdered so many of his brave subjects and bad done what in them lay to cover him with infamy and dishonor and that for her part she should form her judgment of his intentions by his subsequent conduct and in the mean time should act as desired by the ambassador and rather pity than blame his master for the extremities to which he had been carried digges p           elizabeth was fully sensible of the dangerous situation in which she now stood in the massacre of paris she saw the result of that general conspiracy which had been formed for the extermination of the protestants and she knew that she herself as the head and protector of that religion was exposed to the utmost fury and resentment of the catholics the violences and cruelties of the spaniards in the low countries were another branch of the same conspiracy and as charles and philip two princes nearly allied in perfidy and barbarity as well as in bigotry had now laid aside their pretended quarrel and had avowed the most entire friendship ibid p          she had reason so soon as they had appeased their domestic commotions to dread the effects of their united councils the duke of guise also and his family whom charles in order to deceive the admiral had hitherto kept at a distance had now acquired an open and entire ascendant in the court of france and she was sensible that these princes from personal as well as political reasons were her declared and implacable enemies the queen of scots their near relation and close confederate was the pretender to her throne and though detained in custody was actuated by a restless spirit and besides her foreign allies possessed very numerous and zealous partisans in the heart of the kingdom for these reasons elizabeth thought it more prudent not to break all terms with the french monarch but still to listen to the professions of friendship which he made her she allowed even the negotiations to be renewed for her marriage with the duke of alancon charless third brother ibid passim camden p      those with the duke of anjou had already been broke off she sent the earl of worcester to assist in her name at the baptism of a young princess born to charles but before she agreed to give this last mark of condescension she thought it becoming her dignity to renew her expressions of blame and even of detestation against the cruelties exercised on his protestant subjects digges p         camden p      meanwhile she prepared herself for that attack which seemed to threaten her from the combined power and violence of the romanists she fortified portsmouth put her fleet in order exercised her militia cultivated popularity with her subjects acted with vigor for the farther reduction of scotland under obedience to the young king and renewed her alliance with the german princes who were no less alarmed than herself at these treacherous and sanguinary measures so universally embraced by the catholics  french affairs but though elizabeth cautiously avoided the coming to extremities with charles the greatest security which she possessed against his violence was derived from the difficulties which the obstinate resistance of the hugonots still created to him digges p      nor could that prince deem himself secure from the invasion threatened him by all the other protestants of europe the nobility and gentry of england were rouzed to such a pitch of resentment that they offered to levy an army of twentytwo thousand foot and four thousand horse to transport them into france and to maintain them six months at their own charge but elizabeth who was cautious in her measures and who feared to inflame the quarrel between the two religions by these dangerous croisades refused her consent and moderated the zeal of her subjects ibid p         the german princes less political or more secure from the resentment of france forwarded the levies made by the protestants and the prince of conde having escaped from court put himself at the head of these troops and prepared to enter the kingdom the duke of alencon the king of navarre the family of montmorenci and many considerable men even among the catholics displeased either on a private or public account with the measures of the court favored the progress of the hugonots and every thing

still worse both to his native country and to all europe henry duke of anjou who had some time before been elected king of poland no sooner heard of his brothers death than he hastened to take possession of the crown of france and found the kingdom not only involved in the greatest present disorders but exposed to infirmities for which it was extremely difficult to provide any suitable remedy and a concession for liberty of conscience which would have probably appeased the reformers excited the most violent resentment and animosity in the catholics  the civil commotions of france were of too great importance to be overlooked by the other princes of europe and elizabeths foresight and vigilance though somewhat restrained by her frugality led her to take secretly some part in them besides employing on all occasions her good offices in favor of the hugonots she had expended no inconsiderable sums of money in levying that army of germans which the prince of conde and prince casimir conducted into france camden p      and notwithstanding all her negotiations with the court and her professions of amity she always considered her own interests as connected with the prosperity of the french protestants and the depression of the house of guise philip on the other hand had declared himself protector of the league had entered into the closest correspondence with guise and had employed all his authority in supporting the credit of that factious leader the sympathy of religion which of itself begot a connection of interests was one considerable inducement but that monarch had also in view the subduing his rebellious subjects in the netherlands who as they received great encouragement from the french protestants would he hoped finally despair of success after the entire suppression of their friends and confederates  civil wars of the low countries the same political views which engaged elizabeth to support the hugonots would have led her to assist the distressed protestants in the low countries but the mighty power of philip the tranquillity of all his other dominions and the great force which he maintained in these mutinous provinces kept her in awe and obliged her notwithstanding all temptations and all provocations to preserve some terms of amity with that monarch the spanish ambassador remonstrated with her that many of the flemish exiles who infested the seas and preyed on his masters subjects were received into the harbors of england and were there permitted to dispose of their prizes and by these remonstrances the queen found herself under a necessity of denying them all entrance into her dominions but this measure proved in the issue extremely prejudicial to the interests of philip these desperate exiles finding no longer any possibility of subsistence were forced to attempt the most perilous enterprises and they made an assault on the brille a seaport town in holland where they met with success and after a short resistance became masters of the place camden p    the duke of alva was alarmed with the danger and stopping those bloody executions which he was making on the defenseless flemings he hastened with his army to extinguish the flame which falling on materials so well prepared for combustion seemed to menace a general conflagration his fears soon appeared to be well grounded the people in the neighborhood of the brille enraged by that complication of cruelty oppression insolence usurpation and persecution under which they labored flew to arms and in a few days almost the whole provinces of holland and zealand had revolted from the spaniards and had openly declared against the tyranny of alva this event happened in the year       william prince of orange descended from a sovereign family of great luster and antiquity in germany inheriting the possessions of a sovereign family in france had fixed his residence in the low countries and on account of his noble birth and immense riches as well as of his personal virtues was universally regarded as the greatest subject who lived in those provinces he had opposed by all regular and dutiful means the progress of the spanish usurpations and when alva conducted his army into the netherlands and assumed the government this prince well acquainted with the violent character of the man and the tyrannical spirit of the court of madrid wisely fled from the danger which threatened him and retired to his paternal estate and dominions in germany he was cited to appear before alvas tribunal was condemned in absence was declared a rebel and his ample possessions in the low countries were confiscated in revenge he levied an army of protestants in the empire and made some attempts to restore the flemings to liberty but was still repulsed with loss by the vigilance and military conduct of alva and by the great bravery as well as discipline of those veteran spaniards who served under that general the revolt of holland and zealand provinces which the prince of orange formerly commanded and where he was infinitely beloved called him anew from his retreat and he added conduct no less than spirit to that obstinate resistance which was here made to the spanish dominion by uniting the revolted towns into a league he laid the foundation of that illustrious commonwealth the offspring of industry and liberty whose arms and policy have made long so signal a figure in every transaction of europe he inflamed the inhabitants by every motive which religion resentment or love of freedom could inspire though the present greatness of the spanish monarchy might deprive them of all courage he still flattered them with the concurrence of the other provinces and with assistance from the neighboring states and he exhorted them in defense of their religion their liberties their lives to endure the utmost extremities of war from this spirit proceeded the desperate defense of harlem a defense which nothing but the most consuming famine could overcome and which the spaniards revenged by the execution of more than two thousand of the inhabitants bentivoglio lib    this extreme severity instead of striking terror into the hollanders animated them by despair and the vigorous resistance made at alcmaer where alva was finally repulsed showed them that their insolent enemies were not wholly invincible the duke finding at last the pernicious effects of his violent councils solicited to be recalled from the government medinaceli who was appointed his successor refused to accept the charge requesens commendator of castile was sent from italy to replace alva and this tyrant departed from the netherlands in      leaving his name in execration to the inhabitants and boasting in his turn that during the course of five years government he had delivered above eighteen thousand of these rebellious heretics into the hands of the executioner grotius lib     requesens though a man of milder dispositions could not appease the violent hatred which the revolted hollanders had entertained against the spanish government and the war continued as obstinate as ever in the siege of leyden undertaken by the spaniards the dutch opened the dykes and sluices in order to drive them from that enterprise and the very peasants were active in ruining their fields by an inundation rather than fall again under the hated tyranny of spain but notwithstanding this repulse the governor still pursued the war and the contest seemed too unequal between so mighty a monarchy and two small provinces however fortified by nature and however defended by the desperate resolution of the inhabitants the prince of orange therefore in      was resolved to sue for foreign assistance and to make applications to one or other of his great neighbors henry or elizabeth the court of france was not exempt from that spirit of tyranny and persecution which prevailed with the spaniards and that kingdom torn by domestic dissensions seemed not to enjoy at present either leizure or ability to pay regard to foreign interests but england long connected both by commerce and alliance with the netherlands and now more concerned in the fate of the revolted provinces by a sympathy in religion seemed naturally interested in their defense and as elizabeth had justly entertained great jealousy against philip and governed her powerful and opulent kingdom in perfect tranquillity great hopes were entertained that her policy her ambition or her generosity would engage her to support them under their present calamities they sent therefore a solemn embassy to london consisting of st aldegonde douza nivelle buys and melsen and after employing the most humble supplications to the queen they proferred her the possession and sovereignty of their provinces if she would employ her power in their defense  there were many strong motives which might impel elizabeth to accept so liberal an offer she was apprized of the injuries which philip had done her by his intrigues with the malcontents in england and ireland digges p     she was displeased to see a violent and military government eected in her neighborhood she foresaw the danger which she should incur from a total prevalence of the catholics in the low countries and the maritime situation of those provinces as well as their command over the great rivers was a very inviting circumstance to a nation like the english who were beginning to cultivate commerce and naval power but this princess though magnanimous had never entertained the ambition of making conquests or gaining new acquisitions and the whole purpose of her vigilant and active politics was to maintain by the most frugal and cautious expedients the tranquillity of her own dominions an open war with the spanish monarchy was the apparent consequence of her accepting the dominion of these provinces and after taking the inhabitants under her protection she could never afterward in honor abandon them but however desperate their defense might become she must embrace it even farther than her convenience or interest would permit for these reasons she refused in plain terms the sovereignty proffered her but told the ambassadors that in return for the good will which the prince of orange and the states had shown her she would endeavor to mediate an agreement for them on the most reasonable conditions which could be obtained camden p          she sent accordingly sir henry cobham to philip and represented to him the danger which the whole low countries as well as the revolted provinces would incur if france could obtain the least interval from her intestine disorders and find leizure to offer her protection to that mutinous and discontented people philip seemed to take this remonstrance in good part but no accord ensued and the war continued with the same rage and violence as before  it was an accident that delivered the hollanders from their present desperate situation requesens the governor dying suddenly the spanish troops discontented for want of pay and licentious for want of a proper authority to command them broke out into a furious mutiny and threw every thing into confusion they sacked and pillaged the cities of maestricht and antwerp and committed great slaughter on the inhabitants they threatened all the other cities with a like fate and the whole provinces excepting luxembourg united for mutual defense against their violence and called in the prince of orange and the hollanders as their protectors a treaty commonly called the pacification of ghent was formed by common agreement where the removal of foreign troops and the restoration of their ancient liberties were the objects which the provinces stipulated to pursue don john of austria natural brother to philip being appointed governor found on his arrival at luxembourg that the states had so fortified themselves and that the spanish troops were so divided by their situation that there was no possibility of resistance and he agreed to the terms required of him the spaniards were recalled and these provinces seemed at last to breathe a little from their calamities  but it was not easy for an entire peace to be settled while the thirst of revenge and dominion governed the king of spain and while the flemings were so strongly agitated with resentment of past and fear of future injuries the ambition of don john who coveted this great theater for his military talents engaged him rather to inflame than appease the quarrel and as he found the states determined to impose very strict limitations on his authority he broke all articles seized namur and procured the recall of the spanish army from italy this prince endowed with a lofty genius and animated by the prosperous successes of his youth had opened his mind to vast undertakings and looking much beyond the conquest of the revolted provinces had projected to marry the queen of scots and to acquire in her right the dominion of the british kingdoms camden p     grotius lib iii  elizabeth was aware of his intentions and seeing now from the union of all the provinces a fair prospect of making a long and vigorous defense against spain she no longer scrupled to embrace the protection of their liberties which seemed to be so intimately connected with her own safety after sending them over a sum of money about twenty thousand pounds for the immediate pay of their troops she concluded a treaty with them in which she stipulated to assist them with five thousand foot and a thousand horse at the charge of the flemings and to lend them a hundred thousand pounds on receiving the bonds of some of the most considerable towns of the netherlands for her repayment within the year it was farther agreed that the commander of the english army should be admitted into the council of the states and nothing be determined concerning war or peace without previously informing the queen or him of it that they should enter into no league without her consent that if any discord arose among themselves it should be referred to her arbitration and that if any prince on any pretext should attempt hostilities against her they should send to her assistance an army equal to that which she employed in their defense this alliance was signed on the  th of january      camden p      one considerable inducement to the queen for entering into treaty with the states was to prevent their throwing themselves into the arms of france and she was desirous to make the king of spain believe that it was her sole motive she represented to him by her ambassador thomas wilkes that she had hitherto acted religiously the part of a good neighbor and ally had refused the sovereignty of holland and zealand when proffered her had counseled the prince of orange to submit to the king and had even accompanied her advice with menaces in case of his refusal she persevered she said in the same friendly intentions and as a proof of it would venture to interpose with her advice for the composure of the present differences let don john whom she could not but regard as her mortal enemy be recalled let some other prince more popular be substituted in his place let the spanish armies be withdrawn let the flemings be restored to their ancient liberties and privileges and if after these concessions they are still obstinate not to return to their duty she promised to join her arms to those of the king of spain and force them to a compliance philip dissembled his resentment against the queen and still continued to supply don john with money and troops that prince though once repulsed at rimenant by the valor of the english under norris and though opposed as well by the army of the states as by prince casimir who had conducted to the low countries a great body of germans paid by the queen gained a great advantage over the flemings at cemblours but was cut off in the midst of his prosperity by poison given him secretly as was suspected by orders from philip who dreaded his ambition the prince of parma succeeded to the command who uniting valor and clemency negotiation and military exploits made great progress against the revolted flemings and advanced the progress of the spaniards by his arts as well as by his arms  during these years while europe was almost every where in great commotion england enjoyed a profound tranquillity owing chiefly to the prudence and vigor of the queens administration and to the wise precautions which she employed in all her measures by supporting the zealous protestants in scotland she had twice given them the superiority over their antagonists had connected their interests closely with her own and had procured herself entire security from that quarter whence the most dangerous invasions could be made upon her she saw in france her enemies the guises though extremely powerful yet counterballanced by the hugonots her zealous partisans and even hated by the king who was jealous of their restless and exorbitant ambition the bigotry of philip gave her just ground of anxiety but the same bigotry had happily excited the most obstinate opposition among his own subjects and had created him enemies which his arms and policy were not likely soon to overcome the queen of scots her antagonist and rival and the pretender to her throne was a prisoner in her hands and by her impatience and high spirit had been engaged in practices which afforded the queen a pretense for rendering her confinement more rigorous and for cutting off her communication with her partisans in england religion was the capital point on which depended all the political transactions of that age and the queens conduct in this particular making allowance for the prevailing prejudices of the age could scarcely be accused of severity or imprudence she established no inquisition into mens bosoms she imposed no oaths of supremacy except on those who received trust or emolument from the public and though the exercise of all religion but the established was prohibited the violation of this law by the saying mass and receiving the sacrament in private houses was in many instances connived at camden p      while at the same time the catholics in the beginning of her reign showed little reluctance against going to church or frequenting the ordinary duties of public worship the pope sensible that this practice would by degrees reconcile all his partisans to the reformed religion hastened the publication of the bull excommunicating the queen and freeing her subjects from all oaths of allegiance and great pains were taken by the emissaries of rome to render the breach between the two religions as wide as possible and to make the frequenting protestant churches appear highly criminal to the catholics walsinghams letter in burnet vol ii     cabbala p  0   these practices with the rebellions which ensued increased the vigilance and severity of the government but the romanists if their condition was compared with that of the nonconformists in other countries and with their own practices where they domineered could not justly complain much of violence or persecution the queen appeared rather more anxious to keep a strict hand over the puritans who though their pretensions were not so immediately dangerous to her authority seemed to be actuated by a more unreasonable obstinacy and to retain claims of which both in civil and ecclesiastical matters it was as yet difficult to discern the full scope and intention some secret attempts of that sect to establish a separate congregation and discipline had been carefully repressed in the beginning of this reign strypes life of parker p     ibid life of grindal p      and when any of the established clergy discovered a tendency to their principles by omitting the legal habits or ceremonies the queen had shown a determined resolution to punish them by fines and deprivations heylin p         though her orders to that purpose had by the protection which these sectaries received from some of the most considerable courtiers been frequently eluded but what chiefly tended to gain elizabeth the hearts of her subjects was her frugality which though carried sometimes to an extreme led her not to amass treasures but only to prevent impositions upon the people who were at that time very little accustomed to bear the burdens of government by means of her rigid economy she paid all the debts which she found on the crown with their full interest though some of these debts had been contracted even during the reign of her father dewes p     camden p      she repaid some loans which she had exacted at the commencement of her reign a practice in that age somewhat unusual dewes p      and she established her credit on such a footing that no sovereign in europe could more readily command any sum which the public exigencies might at any time require ibid p     during this peaceable and uniform government england furnishes few materials for history and except the small part which elizabeth took in foreign transactions there scarce passed any occurrence which requires a particular detail  a parliament the most memorable event in this period was a session of parliament summoned on the  th of february      where debates were started which may appear somewhat curious and singular peter wentworth a puritan who had signalized himself former parliaments by his free and undaunted spirit opened this session with a premeditated harangue which drew on him the indignation of the house and gave great offense to the queen and the courtiers as it seems to contain the first rude sketch of those principles of liberty which happily gained afterward the ascendant in england it may not be improper to give in a few words the substance of it he premised that the very name of liberty is sweet but the thing itself is precious beyond the most inestimable treasure and that it behoved them to be careful lest contenting themselves with the sweetness of the name they forego the substance and abandon what of all earthly possessions was of the highest value to the kingdom he then proceeded to observe that freedom of speech in that house a privilege so useful both to sovereign and subject had been formerly infringed in many essential articles and was at present exposed to the most imminent danger that it was usual when any subject of importance was handled especially if it regarded religion to surmize that these topics were disagreeable to the queen and that the farther proceeding in them would draw down her indignation upon their temerity that solomon had justly affirmed the kings displeasure to be a messenger of death and it was no wonder that men even though urged by motives of conscience and duty should be inclined to stop short when they found themselves exposed to so severe a penalty that by employing this argument the house was incapacitated from serving their country or even from serving the queen herself whose ears besieged by pernicious flatterers were thereby rendered inaccessible to the most salutary truths that it was a mockery to call an assembly a parliament and yet deny them that privilege which was so essential to their being and without which they must degenerate into an abject school of servitude and dissimulation that as the parliament was the great guardian of the laws they ought to have liberty to discharge their trust and to maintain that authority whence even kings themselves derive their being that a king was constituted such by law and though he was not dependant on man yet was he subordinate to god and the law and was obliged to make their prescriptions not his own will the rule of his conduct that even his commission as gods vicegerent enforced instead of loosening this obligation since he was thereby invested with authority to execute on earth the will of god which is nothing but law and justice that though these surmizes of displeasing the queen by their proceedings had impeached in a very essential point all freedom of speech a privilege granted them by a special law yet was there a more express and more dangerous invasion made on their liberties by frequent messages from the throne that it had become a practice when the house were entering on any question either ecclesiastical or civil to bring an order from the queen prohibiting them absolutely to treat of such matters and barring them all farther discussion of these momentuous articles that the prelates emboldened by her royal protection had assumed a decisive power in all questions of religion and required that every one should implicitly submit his faith to their arbitrary determinations that the love which he bore his sovereign forbad him to be silent under such abuses or to sacrifice on this important occasion his duty to servile flattery and complaisance and that as no earthly creature was exempt from fault so neither was the queen herself but in imposing this servitude on her faithful commons had committed a great and even dangerous fault against herself and the whole realm dewes p         etc   it is easy to observe from this speech that in these first dawnings of liberty the parliamentary style was still crude and unformed and that the proper decorum of attacking ministers and counselors without interesting the honor of the crown or mentioning the person of the sovereign was not as yet entirely established the commons expressed great displeasure at this unusual license they sequestered wentworth from the house and committed him prisoner to the sergeant at arms they even ordered him to be examined by a committee consisting of all those members who were also members of the privy council and a report to be made next day to the house this committee met in the star chamber and wearing the aspect of that arbitrary court summoned wentworth to appear before them and answer for his behavior but though the commons had discovered so little delicacy or precaution in thus confounding their own authority with that of the star chamber wentworth understood better the principles of liberty and refused to give these counselors any account of his conduct in parliament till he was satisfied that they acted not as members of the privy council but as a committee of the house ibid p      he justified himself by pleading the rigor and hardship of the queens messages and notwithstanding that the committee showed him by instances in other reigns that the practice of sending such messages was not unprecedented he would not agree to express any sorrow or repentance the issue of the affair was that after a months confinement the queen sent to the commons informing them that from her special grace and favor she had restored him to his liberty and to his place in the house dewes p      by this seeming lenity she indirectly retained the power which she had assumed of imprisoning the members and obliging them to answer before her for their conduct in parliament and sir walter mildmay endeavored to make the house sensible of her majestys goodness in so gently remitting the indignation which she might justly conceive at the temerity of their member but he informed them that they had not the liberty of speaking what and of whom they pleased and that indiscreet freedoms used in that house had both in the present and foregoing ages met with a proper punishment he warned them therefore not to abuse farther the queens clemency lest she be constrained contrary to her inclination to turn an unsuccessful lenity into a necessary severity ibid p       the behavior of the two houses was in other respects equally tame and submissive instead of a bill which was at first introduced ibid p      for the reformation of the church they were contented to present a petition to her majesty for that purpose and when she told them that she would give orders to her bishops to amend all abuses and if they were negligent she would herself by her supreme power and authority over the church give such redress as would entirely satisfy the nation the parliament willingly acquiesced in this sovereign and peremptory decision ibid p       though the commons showed so little spirit in opposing the authority of the crown they maintained this session their dignity against an incroachment of the lords and would not agree to a conference which they thought was desired of them in an irregular manner they acknowleged however with all humbleness such was their expression the superiority of the lords they only refused to give that house any reason for their proceedings and asserted that where they altered a bill sent them by the peers it belonged to them to desire a conference not to the upper house to require it ibid p       the commons granted an aid of one subsidy and two fifteenths mildmay in order to satisfy the house concerning the reasonableness of this grant entered into a detail of the queens past expenses in supporting the government and of the increasing charges of the crown from the daily increase in the price of all commodities he did not however forget to admonish them that they were to regard this detail as the pure effect of the queens condescension since she was not bound to yield them any account how she employed her treasure ibid p       chap iv scotch affairs

relations he no sooner appeared at stirling where james resided than he acquired the affections of the young monarch and joining his interests with james stuart of the house of ochiltree a young man of profligate manners who had acquired the kings favor he employed himself under the appearance of play and amusement in instilling into the tender mind of the prince new sentiments of politics and

subsequent year  spanish affairs elizabeth was at this time extremely anxious on account of every revolution in scotland because that country alone not being separated from england by sea and bordering on all the catholic and malecontent counties afforded her enemies a safe and easy method of attacking her and because she was sensible that mary thinking herself abandoned by the french monarch had been engaged by the guises to have recourse to the powerful protection of philip who though he had not yet come to an open rupture with the queen was every day both by the injuries which he committed and received more exasperated against her that he might retaliate for the assistance which she gave to his rebels in the low countries he had sent under the name of the pope digges p

assaulted the spaniards in the place where they esteemed themselves the most secure in the new world this man sprung from mean parents in the county of devon having acquired considerable riches by some depredations made on the spaniards in the isthmus of panama and having there got a sight of the pacific ocean was so stimulated by ambition and avarice that he scrupled not to employ his whole

to find a passage by the north of california and failing in that enterprise he set sail for the east indies and returned safely this year by the cape of good hope he was the first eng ishman who compassed the globe and the first commander in chief for magellan whose ship executed the same adventure died in his passage his name became very celebrated on account of so bold and fortunate an attempt but many apprehending the resentment of the spaniards endeavored to persuade the queen that it would be more prudent to disown the enterprise to punish drake and to restore the treasure but elizabeth who admired valor and who was allured by the prospect of sharing in the riches was determined to countenance that gallant sailor she conferred on him the honor of knighthood and accepted of a banquet from him at deptford on board the ship which had achieved so memorable a voyage when philips ambassador mendoza exclaimed against drakes pyracies she told him that the spaniards by arrogating a right to the whole new world and excluding thence all other european nations who should sail thither even with a view of exercising the most lawful commerce very naturally tempted others to make a violent irruption into these countries camden p   0  to pacify however the spanish monarch she caused part of the booty to be restored to pedro sebura a spaniard who pretended to be agent for the merchants whom drake had spoiled  there was another cause which induced the queen to take this resolution she was in such want of money that she was obliged to assemble a parliament a measure which as she herself openly declared she never embraced except when obliged by the necessity of her affairs   th january a parliament the parliament besides granting her a supply of one subsidy and two fifteens enacted some statutes for the security of the government chiefly against the attempts of the catholics whoever in any way reconciled any one to the church of rome or was himself reconciled was declared to be guilty of treason to say mass was subjected to the penalty of a years imprisonment and a fine of two hundred merks the hearing it was punishable by a years imprisonment and a fine of an hundred merks a fine of twenty pounds a month was imposed on every one who continued during that time absent from church    eliz cap    to utter slanderous or seditious words against the queen was punishable for the first offense with the pillory and loss of ears the second offense was declared felony the writing or printing such words was felony even on the first offense ibid c    the puritans prevailed to have farther application made for reformation in religion dewes p  0   paul wentworth brother to the member of that name who had distinguished himself in the preceding session moved that the commons from their own authority should appoint a general fast and prayers and the commons rashly assented to his motion for this presumption they were severely reprimanded by a message from the queen as encroaching on the royal prerogative and supremacy and they were obliged to submit and ask forgiveness ibid p           the queen and parliament were engaged to pass these severe laws against the catholics by some late discoveries which had been made of the treasonable practices of the romish priests when the worship of the catholics was suppressed and the reformation introduced into the universities the king of spain reflected that as some species of literature was requisite for the support of these doctrines and controversies the romish communion must totally decay in england if no means were found to give erudition to the ecclesiastics and for this reason he founded a seminary at douay where the catholics sent their children chiefly those intended for the priesthood in order to receive the rudiments of their education the cardinal of lorraine imitated this example by erecting a like seminary in his diocese of rheims and though rome was somewhat distant the pope would not neglect to adorn with a foundation of the same nature that capital of orthodoxy these seminaries founded with this hostile intention sent over every year a colony of priests who maintained the catholic superstition in the full height of its bigotry and being educated with a view to the crown of martyrdom were not deterred either by danger or fatigue from maintaining and propagating their principles they infused into all their votaries an extreme hatred against the queen whom they treated as an usurper a schismatic a heretic a persecutor of the orthodox and one solemnly and publicly anathematized by the holy father sedition rebellion and even sometimes assassination were the expedients by which they proposed to effectuate their purposes against her and the severe restraint not to say persecution under which the catholics labored made them the more willingly receive from their ghostly fathers such violent doctrines  these seminaries were all of them under the direction of the jesuits a new order of regular priests erected in europe when the court of rome perceived that the lazy monks and beggarly friars who sufficed in times of ignorance were no longer able to defend the ramparts of the church assailed on every side and that the inquisitive spirit of the age required a society more active and more learned to oppose its dangerous progress these men as they stood foremost in the contest against the protestants drew on them the extreme animosity of that whole sect and by assuming a superiority over the other more numerous and more ancient orders of their own communion were even exposed to the envy of their brethren so that it was no wonder if the blame to which their principles and conduct might be exposed has in many instances been much exaggerated this reproach however they must bear from posterity that by the very nature of their institution they were engaged to pervert learning the only effectual remedy against superstition into a nourishment of that infirmity and as their erudition was chiefly of the ecclesiastical and scholastic kind though a few members have cultivated polite literature they were only the more enabled by that acquisition to refine away the plainest dictates of morality and to erect a regular system of casuistry by which prevarication perjury and every crime where it served their ghostly purposes might be justified and defended  the jesuits as devoted servants to the court of rome exalted the prerogative of the sovereign pontiff above all earthly power and by maintaining his authority of deposing kings set no bounds either to his spiritual or temporal jurisdiction this doctrine became so prevalent among the zealous catholics in england that the excommunication fulminated against elizabeth excited many scruples of a singular kind to which it behoved the holy father to provide a remedy the bull of pius in absolving the subjects from their oaths of allegiance required them to resist the queens usurpation and many romanists were apprehensive that by this clause they were obliged in conscience even though no favorable opportunity offered to rebel against her and that no dangers nor difficulties could free them from this indispensible duty but parsons and campian two jesuits were sent over with a mitigation and explanation of the doctrine and they taught their votaries that though the bull was for ever binding on elizabeth and her partisans it did not oblige the catholics to obedience except when the sovereign pontiff should think proper by a new summons to require it camden p      campian was afterward detected in treasonable practices and being put to the rack and confessing his guilt he was publicly executed his execution was ordered at the very time when the duke of anjou was in england and prosecuted with the greatest appearance of success his marriage with the queen and this severity was probably intended to appease her protestant subjects and to satisfy them that whatever measures she might pursue she never would depart from the principles of the reformation  while hostilities were daily multiplying between spain and england and while elizabeth knew that philip from resentment from bigotry and from interest was strongly though secretly induced to effect her ruin she saw the necessity of securing herself against the efforts of so powerful and political a monarch the obstinate resistance of the states in the netherlands gave her hopes that his force and treasure would be wasted in subduing these provinces but the admirable conduct and rapid progress of the prince of parma struck her with apprehensions and as the acquisition which philip about this time made of portugal brought him a great accession of riches and naval power the expediency of seeking the protection of some powerful alliance became every day the more apparent the animosity which still increased between the french monarch and the duke of guise and the confederacy which the latter prince had secretly formed with philip opened the prospect of a close alliance between the sovereigns of france and england and the general apprehensions entertained by all europe of the spanish power seemed to require some general union for resisting its farther progress  negotiations of marriage with the duke of anjou the duke of alencon now created duke of anjou had never entirely dropped his pretensions to espouse elizabeth and that princess though her suitor was near twentyfive years younger than herself and had no knowledge of her person but by pictures or descriptions was still pleased with the counterfeit image which his addresses afforded her of love and tenderness the duke in order to forward his suit besides employing his brothers ambassadors sent over simier an agent of his own an artful man of an agreeable conversation who soon remarking the queens humor amused her with gay discourse and instead of serious political reasonings which he found only awakened her ambition and hurt his masters interests introduced every moment all the topics of passion and of gallantry the pleasure which she found in this mans society soon produced a great familiarity between them and amidst the greatest hurry of business her wisest ministers had not such ready access to her person as had simier who under pretense of negotiation entertained her with accounts of the tender attachment borne her by the duke of anjou the earl of leicester who had never before been alarmed with any courtship made to her and who always trusted that her love of dominion would prevail over her inclination to marriage began to apprehend that she was at last caught in her own snare and that the artful encouragement which she had given to this young suitor had unawares engaged her affections to render simier odious he availed himself of the credulity of the times and spread reports that that minister had gained an ascendant over the queen not by any natural principles of her constitution but by incantations and love potions simier in revenge endeavored to discredit leicester and revealed to her a secret which none of her courtiers dared to discover that this nobleman was secretly without her consent married to the widow of the earl of essex an action which the queen interpreted either to proceed from want of respect to her or as a violation of their mutual attachment and which so provoked her that she threatened to send him prisoner to the tower camden p      the quarrel went so far between leicester and the french agent that the former was suspected of having employed one tudor a bravo to take away the life of his enemy and the queen thought it necessary by proclamation to put simier under her own protection it happened that while the queen was rowed in her barge on the thames attended by simier and some of her courtiers a shot was fired which wounded one of her bargemen but elizabeth finding upon enquiry that the piece had been discharged by accident gave the person his liberty without farther punishment so far was she from entertaining any suspic on against her people that she was many times heard to say that she would lend re it to nothing against them which parents would not believe of their own children    the duke of anjou encouraged by the accounts which he received of the queens prepossessions in his favor paid her secretly a visit at greenwich and after some conference with her the purpo of which i not kn wn he departed it appeared that though his figure was not advance  ground by being personally known to her and  now treasurer sussex leicester  walsingham to concert with the french an  contract henry had sent over on this occassion a very  consisting of francis de bourbon  phiny at  rabble noblemen and as the queen had in a manner the power of prescribing what terms she pleased the articles were soon settled with the english commissioners it was agreed that the marriage should be celebrated within six weeks after the ratification of the articles that the duke and his retinue should have the exercise of their religion that after the marriage he should bear the title of king exercise of their religion that after the marriage he should bear the title of king but the administration should remain solely in the queen that their children male or female should succeed to the crown of england that if there be two males the eldest in case of henrys death without issue should be king of france the younger of england that if there be but one male and he succeed to the crown of france he should be obliged to reside in england eight months every two years that the laws and customs of england should be preserved inviolate and that no foreigner should be promoted by the duke to any office in england camden p      these articles providing for the security of england in case of its annexation to the crown of france opened but a dismal prospect to the english had not the age of the queen who was now in her fortyninth year contributed very much to allay their apprehensions of this nature the queen also as a proof of her still remaining uncertainty added a clause that she was not bound to complete the marriage till farther articles which are not specified shall be agreed on between the parties and till the king of france be certified of their agreement soon after the queen sent over walsingham as ambassador to france in order to form closer connexions with henry and enter into a league offensive and defensive against the increasing power and dangerous usurpations of spain the french king who had been extremely disturbed with the unquiet spirit the restless ambition the enterprizing and yet timid and inconstant disposition of anjou had already sought to free the kingdom from his intrigues by opening a scene for his activity in flanders and having allowed him to embrace the protection of the states had secretly supplied him with men and money for that undertaking the prospect of settling him in england was for a like reason very agreeable to that monarch and he was desirous to cultivate by every expedient the favorable sentiments which elizabeth seemed to entertain toward them but this princess though she had gone farther in her amorous dalliance digges p          0      than could be justified or accounted for by any principles of policy was not yet determined to bring matters to a final conclusion and she confined walsingham in his instructions to the negotiating conditions of a mutual alliance between france and england ibid p      henry with reluctance submitted to hold conferences on that subject but no sooner had walsingham begun to settle the conditions of alliance than he was informed that the queen foreseeing hostility with spain to be the result of this confederacy had declared that she would prefer the marriage with the war before the war without the marriage digges p          the french court pleased with this change of resolution broke off the conferences concerning the league and opened a negotiation for the marriage ibid p      but matters had not long proceeded in this train before the queen again declared for the league in preference to the marriage and ordered walsingham to renew the conferences for that purpose before he had leizure to bring this point to maturity he was interrupted by a new change of resolution ibid p  0       and not only the court of france but walsingham himself burleigh and all the wisest ministers of elizabeth were in amaze doubtful where this contest between inclination and reason love and ambition would at last terminate  in the course of this affair elizabeth felt another variety of intentions from a new contest between her reason and her ruling passions the duke of anjou expected some assistance of money by which he might be enabled to open the campaign in flanders and the queen herself though her frugality made her long reluctant was sensible that this supply was necessary and she was at last induced after much hesitation to comply with his request ibid p                      rymer xv p     she sent him a present of an hundred thousand crowns by which joined to his own demesns and the assistance of his brother and the queen dowager he levied an army and took the field against the prince of parma he was successful in raising the siege of cambray and being chosen by the states governor of the netherlands he put his army into winter quarters and came over to england in order to prosecute his suit to the queen the reception which he met with made him promise himself entire success and gave him hopes that elizabeth had surmounted all her scruples and was finally determined to make choice of him for her husband   th november in the midst of the pomp which attended the anniversary of her coronation she was seen after long and intimate discourse with him to take a ring from her own finger and to put it upon his and all the spectators concluded that in this ceremony she had given him a promise of marriage and was even desirous of signifying her intention to all the world st aldegonde ambassador from the states dispatched immediately a letter to his masters informing them of this great event and the inhabitants of antwerp who as well as the other lemings regarded the queen as a kind of tutelar divinity testified their joy by bonesires and the discharge of their great ordnance camden p   0 thuau lib     a puritan of lincolns inn had wrote a passionate book which he entitled the gulf in which england will be swallowed by the french marriage he was apprehended and prosecuted by order from the queen and was condemned to lose his right hand as a libeller such was the constancy and loyaity of the man that immediately after the sentence was executed he took off his hat with his other hand and waving it over his head cried god save the queen  but notwithstanding this attachment which elizabeth so openly discovered to the duke of anjou the contest of her sentiments was not entirely over and her ambition as well as prudence rouzing itself by intervals still filled her breast with doubt and hesitation almost all the courtiers whom she trusted and favored leicester hatton and walsingham discovered an extreme aversion to the marriage and the ladies of her bed chamber made no scruple of opposing her resolution with the most zealous remonstrances camden p      among other enemies to the match sir philip sidney son to sir henry sidney lord deputy of ireland and nephew to leicester a young man the most accomplished of that age used the freedom to write her a letter where he dissuaded her from her present resolution with an unusual elegance of expression as well as force of reasoning he told her that the security of her government depended entirely on the affections of her protestant subjects and she could not by any measure more effectually disgust them than by espousing a prince who was son to the perfidious catherine brother to the cruel and perfidious charles and who had himself embrued his hands in the blood of the innocent and defenseless protestants that the catholics were her mortal enemies and believed either that she had originally usurped the crown or was now lawfully deposed by the popes bull of excommunication and nothing had ever so much elevated their hopes as the prospect of her marriage with the duke of anjou that her chief security at present against the efforts of so numerous rich and united a saction was that they possessed no head who could conduct their dangerous enterprises and she herself was rashly supplying that defect by giving an interest in the kingdom to a prince whose education had zealously attached him to that communion that though he was a stranger to the royal blood the dispositions of men were now such that they preferred the religious to the civil connexions and were more influenced by the sympathy of religion than by the principles of legal and hereditary government that the duke himself had discovered a very restless and turbulent spirit and having often violated his loyalty to his elder brother and his sovereign there remained no hopes that he would passively submit to a woman whom he might think himself entitled in quality of husband to command that the french nation so populous so much abounding in soldiers so full of nobility who were devoted to arms and for some time accustomed to serve for plunder would supply him with partisans dangerous to a people unwarlike and defenseless like the generality of her subjects that the plain and honorable path which she had followed of cultivating the affections of her people had hitherto rendered her reign secure and happy and however her enemies might seem to multiply upon her the same invincible rampart was still able to protect and defend her that so long as the throne of france was filled by henry or his posterity it was vain to hope that the ties of blood would ensure the amity of that kingdom preferably to the maxims of policy or the prejudices of religion and if ever the crown devolved to the duke of anjou the conjunction of france and england would prove a burden rather than a protection to the latter kingdom that the example of her sister mary was sufficient to instruct her in the danger of such connections and to prove that the affections and confidence of the english could never be maintained where they had such reason to apprehend that their interests would every moment be sacrificed to those of a foreign and hostile nation that notwithstanding these great inconveniences discovered by past experience the house of burgundy it must be confessed was more popular in the nation than the family of france and what was of chief moment philip was of the same communion with mary and was connected with her by this great band of interest and affection and that however the queen might remain childless even though old age should grow upon her the singular felicity and glory of her reign would preserve her from contempt the affections of her subjects and those of all the protestants in europe would defend her from attacks and her own prudence without other aid or assistance would baffle all the efforts of her most malignant enemies letters of the sydneys vol i p    and seq cabbala p      these reflections kept the queen in great anxiety and irresolution and she was observed to pass several nights without any sleep or repose at last her settled habits of prudence and ambition prevailed over her temporary inclination and having sent for the duke of anjou she had a long conversation with him in private where she was supposed to have made him apologies for the breaking her former engagements he expressed great disgust on his departure threw away the ring which she had given him and uttered many curses on the mutability of women and of islanders camden p     soon after he went over to his government of the netherlands lost the confidence of the states by a rash and violent attempt on their liberties was expelled that country retired into france and there died the queen by her timely reflection saved herself from the numerous mischiefs which must have attended so imprudent a marriage and the present distracted  scotch affairs the anxiety of the queen from the attempts of the english catholics never ceased during the whole course of her reign but the variety of revolutions which happened in all the neighboring kingdoms were the source sometimes of her hopes sometimes of her apprehensions this year the affairs of scotland strongly engaged her attention the influence which the earl of lenox and james stuart who now assumed the title of earl of arran had acquired over the young king was but a slender foundation of authority while the generality of the nobles and all the preachers were so much discontented with their administration the assembly of the church appointed a solemn fast of which one of the avowed reasons was the danger in which the king stood from the company of wicked persons spotswood p      and on that day the pulpits resounded with declamations against lenox arran and the kings present counselors when the minds of the people were sufficiently prepared by these lectures a conspiracy of the nobility was formed probably with the concurrence of elizabeth for seizing the person of james at ruthven a seat of the earl of gowry and the design being kept very secret succeeded without any opposition    august the leaders in this enterprise were the earl of gowry himself the earl of mar the lords lindesey and boyd the masters of glamis and oliphant the abbots of dunfermline paisley and cambuskenneth the king wept when he found himself detained a prisoner but the master of glamis said no matter for his tears better that boys should weep than bearded men an expression which james could never afterward forget ibid p   0  but notwithstanding his resentment he found it necessary to submit to the present necessity he pretended an entire acquiescence in the conduct of the associators acknowleged the detention of his person to be acceptable service and agreed to summon both an assembly of the church and a convention of estates in order to ratify that enterprise the assembly though they had established it as an inviolable rule that the king on no account and on no occasion should ever intermeddle in ecclesiastical matters made no scruple of taking civil affairs under their cognizance and of giving their verdict that the attempt of the conspirators was acceptable to all that feared god or tendered the preservation of the kings person and prosperous state of the realm they even enjoined all the clergy to recommend these sentiments from the pulpit and they threatened with ecclesiastical censures every man who should oppose the authority of the consederated lords ibid p      the convention being composed chiefly of these lords themselves added their sanction to these proceedings arran was confined a prisoner to his own house lenox though he had power to resist yet rather than excite a civil war or be the cause of bloodshed heylins hist presbyter p     spotswood  chose to retire into france where he soon after died he persevered to the last in his conversion to the protestant religion which the scotch clergy would never be persuaded that he had sincerely embraced the king sent for his family restored his son to his paternal honors and estate took care to establish the fortunes of all his other children and to his last moments never forgot the early friendship which he had borne their father a strong proof of the good dispositions of that prince spotswood p      no sooner was this revolution known in england than the queen sent sir henry carry and sir robert bows to james in order to congratulate him on his deliverance from the pernicious counsels of lenox and arran to exhort him not to resent the seeming violence of the lords enterprise and to procure from him permission for the return of the earl of angus who ever since mortons fall had lived in england they easily prevailed in the last application and as james suspected that elizabeth had not been entirely unacquainted with the project of his detention he thought proper before the english ambassadors to dissemble his resentment against the confederated noblemen soon after la mothefenelon and menneville appeared as ambassadors from france passing the sentence of excommunication against them on account of their submission to royal preferably to clerical authority spotswood p       what increased the alarm with regard to an accommodation between james and mary was that the english ambassadors seemed to concur with the french in this proposal and the clergy were so ignorant as to credit the sincerity of the professions made by the former the queen of scots had often made overtures to elizabeth which had been entirely neglected letter of queen mary to elizabeth but hearing of jamess detention she wrote a letter in a more pathetic and more spirited strain than usual craving the assistance of that princess both for her own and her sons liberty she said that the account of the princes captivity had excited her most tender concern and the experience which she herself during so many years had of the extreme infelicity attending that situation had made her the more apprehensive lest a like fate should her unhappy offspring that the long train of injustice which she had suffered the calumnies to which she had been exposed were so grievous that finding no place for right or truth among men she was reduced to make her last appeal to heaven the only competent tribunal between princes of equal jurisdiction degree and dignity that after her rebellious subjects secretly instigated by elizabeths ministers had expelled her from the throne had confined her to prison had pursued her with arms she had voluntarily thrown herself under the protection of england fatally allured by those reiterated professions of amity which had been made her and by her confidence in the generosity of a friend an ally and a kinswoman that not contented with debarring her from her presence with supporting the usurpers of her throne with contributing to the destruction of her faithful subjects elizabeth had reduced her to a worse captivity than that from which she had escaped and had made her this cruel return for the unlimited trust which she had reposed in her that though her resentment of such severe usage had never carried her farther than to use some disappointed efforts for her deliverance unhappy to herself and fatal to others she found the rigours of confinement daily multiplied upon her and at length carried to such a height as surpassed the bounds of all human patience any longer to endure them that she was cut off from all communication not only with the rest of mankind but also with her only son and her maternal fondness which was now more enlivened by their unhappy sympathy in situation and was her sole remaining attachment to the world deprived even of that melancholy solace which letters or messages could give that the bitterness of her sorrows still more than her close consinement had preyed upon her health and had added the insufferable weight of bodily infirmity to all those other calamities under which she labored that while the daily experience of her maladies opened to her the comfortable prospect of an approaching deliverance into a region where pain and sorrow are no more her enemies envied her that last consolation and having secluded her from every joy on earth had done what in them lay to debar her from all hopes in her future and eternal existence that the exercise of her religion was refused her the usage of those rites in which she had been educated the commerce with those holy ministers whom heaven had appointed to receive the acknowlegement of our transgressions and to seal our penitence by a solemn readmission into heavenly favor and forgiveness that it was in vain to complain of the rigours of persecution exercised in other kingdoms when a queen and an innocent woman was excluded from an indulgence which never yet in the most barbarous countries had been denied to the meanest and most criminal malefactor that could she ever be induced to descend from that royal dignity in which providence had placed her or depart from her appeal to heaven there was only one other tribunal to which she would appeal from all her enemies to the justice and humanity of elizabeths own breast and to that lenity which uninfluenced by malignant counsel she would naturally be induced to exercise toward her and that she finally entreated her to resume her natural disposition and to reflect on the support as well as comfort which she might receive from her son and herself if joining the obligations of gratitude to the ties of blood she would deign to raise them from their present melancholy situation and reinstate them in that liberty and authority to which they were entitled camden p      elizabeth was chiefly induced to obstruct marys restoration because she foresaw an unhappy alternative attending that event if this princess recovered any considerable share of authority in scotland her resentment ambition zeal and connections both domestic and foreign might render her a dangerous neighbor to england and enable her after suppressing the english party among her subjects to revive those pretensions which she had formerly advanced to the crown and which her partisans in both kingdoms still supported with great industry and assurance if she was reinstated in power with such strict limitations as could not be broken she might be disgusted with her situation and flying abroad form more desperate attempts than any sovereign who had a crown to hazard would willingly undertake mary herself sensible of these difficulties and convinced by experience that elizabeth would for ever debar her the throne was now become more humble in her wishes and as age and infirmities had repressed those sentiments of ambition and indignation by which she was formerly so much agitated she was willing to sacrifice all her hopes of power and grandeur in order to obtain a little more liberty a blessing to which she very naturally aspired with the fondest impatience she proposed therefore that she should be associated with her son in the title to the crown of scotland but that the administration should remain solely in him and she was contented to live in england in a private station and even in a kind of restraint but with some more liberty both for exercise and company than she had enjoyed since the first discovery of her intrigues with the duke of norfolk but elizabeth who was afraid lest such a loose method of guarding her would facilitate her escape into france or spain or at least would encourage and increase her partisans and enable her to conduct those intrigues to which she had already discovered so strong a propensity was secretly determined to deny her requests and though she feigned to assent to them she well knew how to disappoint the expectations of the unhappy princess while lenox maintained his authority in scotland she never gave any reply to all the applications made her by the scottish queen jebb vol ii p   0  at present when her own creatures had acquired possession of the government she was resolved to throw the odium of the refusal upon them and pretending that nothing was required to a perfect accommodation but the concurrence of the council of state of scotland she ordered her ambassador bows to open the negotiation for marys liberty and her association with her son in the title to the crown though she seemed to make this concession to mary she refused her the liberty of sending any ambassador of her own and that princess could easily conjecture from this circumstance what would be the issue of the pretended negotiation the scotch council instigated by the clergy rejected all treaty and james who was now a captive in their hands affirmed that he had never assented to an association with his mother and that the matter had never gone farther than some loose proposals for that purpose ms in the advocates library a      p  0  from the cott lib calig c     the affairs of scotland remained not long on the present footing james impatient of restraint made his escape from his keepers and flying to st andrews summoned his friends and partisans to attend him the earls of argyle marshal montrose and rothes hastened to pay their duty to their sovereign and the opposite party found themselves unable to resist so powerful a combination they were offered a pardon upon their submission and an acknowlegement of their fault in seizing the kings person and restraining him from his liberty some of them accepted of the terms the greater number particularly angus hamilton mar glamis left the country and took shelter in ireland or england where they were protected by elizabeth the earl of arran was recalled to court and the malcontents who could not brook the authority of lenox a man of virtue and moderation found that by their resistance they had thrown all the power into the hands of a person whose councils were as violent as his manners were profligate spotswood p         and seq   elizabeth wrote a letter to james where she quoted a moral sentence from isocrates and indirectly reproached him with inconstancy and a breach of his engagements james in his reply justified his measures and turned two passages of isocrates against her for one which she had directed against him melvil p   0     strype vol iii p      she next sent walsingham in an embassy to him and her chief purpose in employing that aged minister on an errand where so little business was to be transacted was to learn from a man of so much penetration and discernment the real character and capacity of james this young prince possessed very good parts though not accompanied with that vigor and industry which his station required and as he excelled in general discourse and conversation walsingham entertained a higher idea of his talents than he was afterward found when real business was transacted to have fully merited melvil p     jebb vol ii p      the account which he gave his mistress induced her to treat him thenceforth with some more regard than she had hitherto been inclined to pay him  spotswood p      the clergy finding that the pulpit would be no longer a sanctuary for them were extremely offended they said that the king was become popish in his heart and they gave their adversaries the epithets of gross libertines belly gods and infamous persons ibid p      the violent conduct of arran soon brought over the popularity to their side the earl of gowry though pardoned for the late attempt was committed to prison was tried on some new accusations condemned and executed many innocent persons suffered from the tyranny of this favorite and the banished lords being assisted by elizabeth now found the time favorable for the recovery of their estates and authority after they had been soiled in one attempt upon stirling they prevailed in another and being admitted to the kings presence were pardoned and restored to his favor  arran was degraded from authority deprived of that estate and title which he had usurped and the whole country seemed to be composed to tranquillity elizabeth after opposing during some time the credit of this favorite had found it more expedient before his fall to compose all differences with him by the means of davison a minister whom she sent to scotland but having more confidence in the lords whom she had helped to restore she was pleased with this alteration of affairs and maintained a good correspondence with the new court and ministry of james  conspiracies in england these revolutions in scotland would have been regarded as of small importance to the repose and security of elizabeth had her own subjects been entirely united and had not the zeal of the catholics excited by constraint more properly than persecution daily threatened her with some dangerous insurrection the vigilance of the ministers particularly of burleigh and walsingham was raised in proportion to the activity of the malcontents and many arts which had been blameable in a more peaceable government were employed to detect conspiracies and even discover the secret inclinations of men counterfeit letters were wrote in the name of the queen of scots or of the english exiles and privately conveyed to the houses of the catholics spies were hired to observe the actions and discourse of suspected persons informers were countenanced and though the sagacity of these two great ministers helped them to distinguish the true from the false intelligence many calumnies were no doubt hearkened to and all the subjects particularly the catholics kept in the utmost anxiety and inquietude henry piercy earl of northumberland brother to the earl beheaded some years before and philip howard earl of arundel son to the unfortunate duke of norfolk fell under suspicion and the latter was by order of the council confined to his own house francis throcmorton a private gentleman was committed to custody on account of a letter which he had wrote to the queen of scots and which was intercepted lord pager and charles arundel who had been engaged with him in treasonable designs immediately withdrew beyond sea throcmorton confessed that a plan for an invasion and insurrection had been laid and though on his trial he was desirous of retracting this confession and imputing it to the fear of torture he was found guilty and executed mendoza the spanish ambassador having promoted this conspiracy was ordered to depart the kingdom and wade was sent into spain to excuse his dismission and to desire the king to send another ambassador in his place but philip would not so much as admit the english ambassador to his presence creighton a scotch jesuit coming over on board a vessel which was seized tore some papers with an intention of throwing them into the sea but the wind blowing them back upon the ship they were put together and discovered some dangerous secrets camden p       many of these conspiracies were with great appearance of reason imputed to the contrivances of the queen of scots strype vol iii p      and as her name was employed in all of them the council thought that they could not use too many precautions against the danger of her claims and the restless activity of her temper she was removed from under the care of the earl of shrewsbury who though vigilant and faithful in that trust had also been indulgent to his prisoner particularly with regard to air and exercise and she was committed to the custody of sir amias paulet and sir drue drury men of honor but inflexible and rigid in their care and attention an association was also set on foot by the earl of leicester and other courtiers and as elizabeth was extremely beloved by the whole nation except the more zealous catholics men of all ranks willingly flocked to the subscription of it the purport of this association was to defend the queen to revenge her death or any injury committed against her and to exclude from the throne any person whatever title they possessed by whose suggestion or for whose behoof any violence should be offered to her majesty state trial vol i p          the queen of scots was sensible that this association was levelled against her and to remove all suspicion from herself she also desired leave to subscribe it    d november a parliament elizabeth that she might the more discourage all malcontents by showing them the concurrence of the nation in her favor summoned a new parliament and she met with that dutiful attachment which she expected the association was confirmed by parliament and a clause was added by which the queen was empowered to name commissioners for the trial of any pretender to the crown who should attempt or imagine any invasion insurrection or assassination against the queen upon condemnation pronounced by these commissioners the person was excluded from all claim to the succession and was farther punishable as her majesty should direct and for the greater security a council of regency in case of the queens violent death was appointed to govern the kingdom to settle the succession and to take vengeance of that act of treason    eliz cap     a severe law was also enacted against jesuits and popish priests that they should depart the kingdom within forty days that those who should remain beyond that time or should afterward return should be guilty of high treason that those who harbored or relieved them should be guilty of felony that those who were educated in seminaries if they returned not in six months after notice given and submitted not themselves to the queen before a bishop or two justices should be guilty of high treason and that if any so submitting themselves should within ten years approach the queens court or come within ten miles of it their submission should be void   eliz cap    by this law the exercise of the catholic religion which had formerly been prohibited under lighter penalties and which was in many instances connived at was totally suppressed in the subsequent part of the queens reign the law was sometimes executed by the capital punishment of priests and though the partisans of that princess asserted that they were punished for their treason not their religion the apology must only be so understood that this severe law was enacted on account of the treasonable views and attempts of the sect not that every individual who suffered the penalty of the law was convicted of treason some even of those who defend the queens measures allow that in ten years fifty priests were executed and fiftyfive banished camden p      the catholics therefore might now justly complain of a very violent persecution which we may safely affirm in spite of the rigid and bigoted maxims of that age not to be the best method of converting them or of reconciling them to the established government and religion  the parliament besides arming the queen with these powers granted her a supply of one subsidy and two fifteenths the only circumstance in which their proceedings were disagreeable to her was an application which the commons made for a farther reformation in ecclesiastical matters yet even in this attempt which affected her as well as them in a very delicate point they discovered how much they were overawed by her authority the majority of the house were puritans or inclined to that sect besides the petition aftermentioned another proof of the prevalency of the puritans among the commons was their passing a bill for the reverend observance of sunday which they called the sabbath and the depriving the people of those amusements which they were accustomed to take on that day dewes p     it was a strong symptom of a contrary spirit in the upper house that they proposed to add wednesday to the fast days and to prohibit entirely the eating of flesh on that day dewes p      but the severe reprimands which they had already in former sessions met with from the throne deterred them from introducing any bill concerning religion a proceeding which would have been interpreted as an incroachment on the royal prerogative they were contented to proceed by way of humble petition and that not to her majesty which would certainly have given some offense but to the house of lords or rather to the bishops who had a seat in that house and from whom alone they were contented to receive all advances toward reformation dewes p      a strange departure from what we now apprehend to be the dignity of the commons  the commons desired in their humble petition that no bishop should exercise his function of ordination but with the consent and concurrence of six presbyters a demand which as it would have introduced a change of ecclesiastical government was firmly rejected by the prelates they desired that no clergyman should be instituted into any benefice without previous warning being given to the parish that they might examine whether there lay any objection to his life or doctrine but this attempt toward a popular model naturally met with the same fate in another article of the petition they prayed that the bishops should not insist upon every ceremony or deprive incumbents for omitting a part of the service as if uniformity in public worship had not been established by law or as if the prelates had been endowed with a dispensing power they complained of abuses which prevailed in denouncing the sentence of excommunication and entreated the reverend fathers to think of some law for the remedy of these abuses implying that those matters were too high for the commons of themselves to meddle with them  but the most material article which the commons touched upon in their petition was the ecclesiastical commission and the oath ex officio as it was called exacted by that court this is a subject of such importance as to merit some explanation  the ecclesiastical court the first primate after the queens accession was parker a man rigid in exacting conformity to the established worship and in punishing by fines or deprivations all the puritans who attempted to innovate any thing in the habits ceremonies or liturgy of the church he died in      and was succeeded by grindal who as he himself inclined to the new sect was with great difficulty brought to execute the law against them or to punish the nonconforming clergy he declined obeying the queens orders for the suppression of prophecyings which she apprehended had become so many academies of fanaticism and for this offense she had by an order of the star chamber sequestered him from his archiepiscopal function and confined him to his own house upon his death which happened in      she was determined not to fall into the same error in her next choice and she named whitgift a zealous churchman who had already signalized his pen in controversy and who having in vain attempted to convince the puritans by argument was now determined to open their eyes by power and by the execution of penal statutes he informed the queen that all the spiritual authority lodged in the prelates was vain without the sanction of the crown and as there was no ecclesiastical commission at that time in force he engaged her to issue a new one more arbitrary than any of the former and conveying more unlimited authority neals history of the puritans vol i p   0  she appointed fortyfour commissioners twelve of whom were ecclesiastics three commissioners could exercise the whole power of the court their jurisdiction extended over the whole kingdom and over all orders of men and every circumstance of their authority and all their methods of proceeding were contrary to the clearest principles of law and natural equity they were empowered to visit and reform all errors heresies schisms in a word to regulate all opinions as well as to punish all breach of uniformity in the exercise of public worship they were directed to make enquiry not only by the legal methods of juries and witnesses but by all other means and ways which they could devise that is by the rack by torture by inquisition by imprisonment where they thought proper to suspect any person they might administer to him an oath called ex officio by which he was bound to answer all questions and might thereby be obliged to accuse himself or his most intimate friend the fines which they imposed were merely discretionary and often occasioned the total ruin of the offenders contrary to the established law of the kingdom the imprisonment to which they condemned any delinquent was limited by no rule but their own pleasure they assumed a power of imposing on the clergy what new articles of subscription and consequently of faith they thought proper though all other spiritual courts were subject since the reformation to inhibitions from the supreme courts of law the ecclesiastical commissioners exempted themselves from that legal jurisdiction and were liable to no control and the more to enlarge their authority they were empowered to punish all incests adulteries fornications all outrages misbehaviours and disorders in marriage and the punishments which they might inflict were according to their wisdom conscience and discretion in a word this court was a real inquisition attended with all the iniquities as well as cruelties inseparable from that horrid tribunal and as the jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical court was destructive of all law so its erection was deemed by many a mere usurpation of this imperious princess and had no other foundation than a clause of a statute restoring the supremacy to the crown and empowering the sovereign to appoint commissioners for exercising that prerogative but prerogative in general and especially the supremacy were supposed in that age to involve powers which no law precedent or reason could limit and determine  but though the commons in their humble petition to the prelates had touched so gently and submissively the ecclesiastical grievances the queen in a speech from the throne at the end of the session could not forbear taking notice of their presumption and reproving them for those murmurs which for fear of offending her they had pronounced so low as not directly to reach her royal ears after giving them some general thanks for their attachment to her and making professions of affection to her subjects she told them that whoever found fault with the church threw a slander upon her since she was appointed by god supreme ruler over it and no heresies or shisms could prevail in the kingdom but by her permission and negligence that some abuses must necessarily have place in every thing but she warned the prelates to be watchful for if she found them careless of their charge she was fully determined to depose them that she was commonly supposed to have employed herself in many studies particularly philosophical by which i suppose she meant theological and she would confess that few whose leizure had not allowed them to make profession of science had read or reflected more that as she could discern the presumption of many in curiously canvassing the scriptures and starting innovations she would no longer endure this license but meant to guide her people by gods rule in the just mean between the corruptions of rome and the errors of modern sectaries and that as the romanists were the inveterate enemies of her person so the other innovators were dangerous to all kingly government and under color of preaching the word of god presumed to exercise their private judgment and to censure the actions of the prince dewes p     this sect had indeed gone so far that a book of discipline was secretly subscribed by above five hundred clergymen and the presbyterian government thereby established in the midst of the church notwithstanding the rigor of the prelates and of the high commission so impossible is it by penal statutes however severe to suppress all religious innovation see neals hiof the puritans vol i p     strypes life of whitgift p       from the whole of this transaction we may observe that the commons in their general application to the prelates as well as some particular articles of their petition showed themselves wholly ignorant no less than the queen of the principles of liberty and a legal constitution and it may not be unworthy of remark that elizabeth so far from yielding to the displeasure of the parliament against the ecclesiastical commission granted a new commission before the end of her reign in which she enlarged rather than restrained the powers of the commissioners rymer tom xvi p          00   during this session of parliament there was discovered a conspiracy which much increased the natural animosity against the catholics and still farther widened the breach between the religious parties william parry a catholic gentleman had received the queens pardon for a crime by which he was exposed to capital punishment and having got permission to travel he retired to milan and made open profession of his religion which he had concealed while he remained in england he was here persuaded by palmio a jesuit that he could not perform a more meritorious action than to take away the life of his sovereign and his benefactress the nuncio campeggio when consulted approved extremely of this pious undertaking and parry though still agitated with doubts came to paris with an intention of passing over to england and executing his bloody purpose he was here encouraged in the design by thomas morgan a gentleman of great credit in the party and though watts and some other catholic priests told him that the enterprise was criminal and impious he preferred the authority of raggazzoni the popes nuncio at paris and was determined to persist in his resolution he here wrote a letter to the pope which was conveyed to cardinal como communicated his intention to the holy father and craved his absolution and paternal benediction he received an answer from the cardinal by which he perceived that his purpose was extremely applauded and he came over to england with a full design of carrying it into execution so deeply are the sentiments of morality engraved in mens breasts that it is very difficult even for the prejudices of false religion totally to efface them and this bigoted assassin resolved before he came to extremity to try every other expedient for alleviating the persecutions under which the catholics at that time labored he found means of being introduced to the queen assured her that many conspiracies were formed against her and exhorted her as the only means of saving her life to give the romanists some more indulgence in the exercise of their religion but lest he should be tempted by the opportunity to assassinate her he always came to court unprovided of every offensive weapon he even procured himself to be elected member of parliament and having made a vehement speech against the severe laws enacted this last session was committed to custody for his freedom and sequestered from the house his failure in these attempts confirmed him the more in his former resolution and he communicated his intentions to nevil who entered zealously into the design and was determined to have a share in the merits of its execution a book newly published by dr allen afterward created a cardinal served farther to efface all their scruples with regard to the murder of a heretical prince and having agreed to shoot the queen as she was riding on horseback they resolved if they could not make their escape to sacrifice their lives in fulfilling a duty so agreeable as they imagined to the will of god and to true religion but while they were watching an opportunity for the execution of their purpose the earl of westmoreland happened to die in exile and as nevil was next heir to that family he began to entertain hopes that by doing an acceptable service to the queen he might recover the estate and honors which had been forfeited by the rebellion of the last earl state trials vol i p  0  and seq strype vol iii p     and seq  suffered the punishment which the law appointed for his treasonable conspiracy this year the earl of northumberland brother to the earl beheaded some years before had been engaged in a conspiracy with lord paget for the delivery of the queen of scots he was thrown into the tower and being conscious that his guilt could be proved upon him at least that sentence would infallibly be pronounced against him he freed himself from farther prosecution by a voluntary death he shot himself into the breast with a pistol about the same time the earl of arundel son to the unfortunate duke of norfolk having entered into some exceptionable measures and reflecting on the unhappy fate which had attended his family endeavored to depart secretly beyond sea but was discovered and thrown into the tower in      this nobleman was brought to his trial for high treason chiefly because he had dropped some expressions of affection to the spaniards and had affirmed that he would have masses said for the success of the armada his peers found him guilty of treason this severe sentence was not executed but arundel never recovered his liberty he died a prisoner in      he carried his religious austerities so far that they were believed the immediate cause of his death   these bloody designs now appeared every where as the result of that bigoted spirit by which the two religions especially the catholic were at this time actuated one somerville a gentleman of the county of warwic somewhat disordered in his understanding had heard so much of the merit attending the assassination of heretics and persecutors that he came to london with a view of murdering the queen but having betrayed his design by some extravagances he was thrown into prison and there perished by a voluntary death camden p      affairs of the low countries about the same time baltazar gerard a burgundian undertook and executed the same design against the prince of orange and that great man perished at delst by the hands of a desperate assassin who with a resolution worthy of a better cause sacrificed his own life in order to destroy the famous restorer and protector of religious liberty the flemings who regarded that prince as their father were filled with infinite regret as well when they considered the miserable end of so brave a patriot as their own forlorn condition from the loss of so powerful and prudent a leader and from the rapid progress of the spanish arms the prince of parma had made every year great advances upon them had reduced several of the provinces to obedience and had laid close siege to antwerp the richest and most populous city of the netherlands whose subjection it was foreseen would give a mortal blow to the already declining affairs of the revolted states the only hopes which remained to them arose from the prospect of foreign succors being well acquainted with the cautious and frugal maxims of elizabeth they promised themselves better success in france and in the view of engaging henry to embrace their defense they tendered him the sovereignty of their provinces but the present condition of that monarchy obliged the king to reject so advantageous an offer the duke of anjous death which he thought would have delivered him from the intrigues of that fickle and turbulent prince plunged him into the deepest distress and the king of navarre a professed hugonot being next heir to the crown the duke of guise took thence occasion to revive the catholic league and to urge henry by the most violent expedients to seek the exclusion and suppression of that brave and virtuous prince henry himself though a zealous catholic yet because he declined complying with their precipitant measures became an object of aversion to the league and as his zeal in practicing all the superstitious observances of the romish church was accompanied with a very licentious conduct in private life the catholic faction in contradiction to the most vulgar experience embraced thence the pretext of representing his devotion as mere hypocrisy and deceit finding his authority to decline he was obliged to declare war against the hugonots and to put arms into the hands of the league whom both on account of their dangerous pretensions at home and their close alliance with philip he secretly regarded as his more dangerous enemies constrained by the same policy he perceived the danger of associating himself with the revolted protestants in the low countries and was obliged to renounce that inviting occasion of revenging himself for all the hostile intrigues and enterprises of philip  the states reduced to this extremity sent over a solemn embassy to london and made offer to the queen of acknowleging her for their sovereign on condition of obtaining her protection and assistance elizabeths wisest counselors were very much divided in opinion in regard to the conduct which she should hold in this critical and important emergence some advised the rejecting the offer of the states and represented the imminent dangers as well as injustice attending the acceptance of them they said that the rebellion of subjects was the common cause of all sovereigns and the encouragement of a revolt in the flemish might prove the example to a like pernicious practice in the english that though princes were bound by the laws of the supreme being not to oppress their subjects the people never were entitled to forget all duty to their sovereign or transfer from every fancy or disgust or even from the justest ground of complaint their obedience to any other master that the queen in the succors hitherto afforded the flemings had considered them as laboring under oppression not as entitled to freedom and had intended only to admonish philip not to persevere in his tyranny without any view of ravishing from him these provinces which he enjoyed by hereditary right from his ancestors that her situation in ireland and even in england would afford that powerful monarch sufficient opportunity of retaliating upon her and she must henceforth expect that instead of secretly somenting faction he would openly employ his whole force in the protection and defense of the catholics that the pope would undoubtedly unite his spiritual arms to the temporal ones of spain and that the queen would soon repent her making so small and precarious an acquisition in foreign countries by exposing her own dominions to such imminent danger camden p  0  bentivoglio partz lib iv   other counselors of elizabeth maintained a contrary opinion they asserted that the queen had not even from the beginning of her reign but certainly had not at present the choice whether she would embrace friendship or hostility with philip that by the whole tenor of that princes conduct it appeared that his sole aims were the extension of his empire and the utter extermination of the protestants under the specious pretense of maintaining the catholic faith that the provocations which she had already given him joined to this general scheme of policy would for ever render him her implacable enemy and as soon as he had subdued his revolted subjects he would undoubtedly fall with the whole force of his united empire on her defenseless state that the only question was whether she would maintain a war abroad and supported by allies or wait till the subjection of all the confederates of england should give her enemies leisure to begin their hostilities in the bowels of that kingdom that the revolted provinces though in a declining condition possessed still considerable force and by the assistance of england by the advantages of their situation and by their inveterate antipathy to philip might still be enabled to maintain the contest against the spanish monarchy that their maritime power united to the queens would give her entire security on that side from which alone she could be assaulted and would even enable her to make inroads on philips dominions both in europe and the indies that a war which was necessary could never be unjust and selfdefence was concerned as well in warding certain dangers at a distance as in repelling any immediate invasion and that since hostility with spain was the unavoidable consequence of the present interests and situations of the two monarchies it was better to compensate that danger and loss by the acquisition of such important provinces to the english empire camden ibid bentivoglio ibid   amidst these opposite councils the queen apprehensive of the consequences attending each extreme was inclined to steer a middle course and though such conduct is seldom prudent she was not in this resolution guided by any prejudice or affection she was determined not to see without opposition the total ruin of the revolted provinces whose interests she esteemed so closely connected with her own but foreseeing that the acceptance of their sovereignty would engage her to employ her whole force in their defense would give umbrage to her neighbors and would expose her to the reproach of ambition and usurpation imputations which she had hitherto carefully avoided she immediately rej cted this offer she concluded a league with the states on the following conditions that she should send over an army to their assistance of five thousand foot and a thousand horse and pay them during the war that the general and two others whom she should appoint should be admitted into the council of the states that neither party should make peace without the consent of the other that her expenses should be refunded after the conclusion of the war and that the towns of flushing and the brille with the castle of rammekins should in the mean time be consigned into her hands by way of security  the queen knew that this measure would immediately engage her in open hostilities with philip yet was she not terrified with the view of the present greatness of that ambitious and enterprizing monarch the continent of spain was at that time rich and populous and the late addition of portugal besides securing internal tranquillity had annexed an opulent kingdom to philips dominions had made him master of many settlements in the east indies and of the whole commerce of those regions and had mightily increased his naval power in which he was before chiefly deficient all the princes of italy even the pope and the court of rome were reduced to a kind of subjection under him and seemed to possess their sovereignty on very precarious and uncertain terms the austrian branch in germany with all their dependant principalities was closely connected with him and was ready to supply him with troops for every enterprise the whole treasures of the west indies were in his possession and the present scarcity of the precious metals in every country of europe rendered the inssuence of his riches the more forcible and extensive the netherlands seemed on the point of relapsing into servitude and small hopes were entertained of their withstanding those numerous and veteran armies which under the command of the most experienced generals he employed against them even france which used to counterballance the austrian greatness had lost all her force from intestine commotions and as the catholics the ruling party were closely connected with him he rather expected thence an augmentation than a diminution of his power upon the whole such prepossessions were every where entertained concerning the force of the spanish monarchy that the king of sweden when he heard that elizabeth had openly embraced the defense of the revolted flemings scrupled not to say that she had now taken the diadem from her head and had adventured it upon the doubtful chance of war camden    yet was this princess rather cautious than enterprizing in her natural temper she ever needed more to be impelled by the vigor than restrained by the prudence of her ministers but when she saw an evident necessity she braved danger with magnanimous courage and trusting to her own consummate wisdom and to the affections however divided of her people she prepared herself to resist and even to assault the whole force of the catholic monarch  the earl of leicester was sent over to holland at the head of the english auxiliary forces he carried with him a splendid retinue being accompanied with the young earl of essex his son inlaw the lords audley and north sir william russel sir thomas shirley sir arthur basset sir walter waller sir gervase clifton and a select troop of five hundred gentlemen he was received on his arrival at flushing by his nephew sir philip sidney the governor and every town through which he passed expressed their joy by acclamations and triumphal arches as if his presence and the queens protection had brought them the most certain deliverance the states desirous of engaging elizabeth still farther in their defense and knowing the interest which leicester ssed with her conserred on him the title of governor and captain general of the united provinces appointed a guard to attend him and treated him in  respects as their sovereign but this step had a contrary effect to what they expected the queen was displeased with the artifice of the states  of leicester she reprimanded both of them very severely by ltters and it was with some difficulty that after many humble submissions they were able to appease her   america was regarded as the chief ource of philips power as will as the oll desenceless part of his dominions and elizabeth finding that an  reach with that monarch was unavoidable resolved not to leave him unmolested on that quarter the great success of the spaniards and portugueze in both indies had excited a spirit of emulation in england and as the success of commerce still more of planting colonies is slow and gradual it was happy that a war in this critical age had opened a more flattering prospect to the avarice and ambition of the english and had tempted them by the view of sudden and exorbitant profit to engage in naval enterprises a fleet of twenty sail was equipped to attack the spaniard in the west indies two thousand three hundred volunteers besides seamen engaged on board of it sir francis drake was appointed admiral christopher carlisle commander of the land forces they took st jago near cape verde by surprise and found in it plenty of provisions but no riches   january they sailed to hispaniola and easily making themselves master of st domingo by assault obliged the inhabitants to ransom their houses by a sum of money carthagena fell next into their hands after some more resistance and was treated in the same manner they burned st anthony and st helens two towns on the coast of florida sailing along the coast of virginia they found the small remains of a colony which had been planted there by sir walter raleigh and which had gone extremely to decay this was the first attempt of the english to form such settlements and though they have since surpassed all european nations both in the situations of their colonies and in the noble principles of liberty and industry on which they are founded they had here been so unsuccessful that the miserable planters abandoned their settlements and prevailed on drake to carry them with him to england he returned with so much riches as encouraged the volunteers and with such accounts of the spanish weakness in those countries as served extremely to inflame the spirits of the nation to future enterprises the great mortality which the climate had produced in his fleet was as is usual but a feeble restraint on the avidity and sanguine hopes of young adventurers camden p  0   it is thought that drakes fleet first introduced the use of tobacco into england  the enterprises of leicester were much less successful than those of drake this man possessed neither courage nor capacity equal to the trusts reposed in him by the queen and as he was the only bad choice whom she made for any considerable advancement men naturally believed that she had here been influenced by an affection still more partial than that of friendship he gained at first some advantage in an action against the spaniards and threw succors into grave by which that place was enabled to make a vigorous defense but the cowardice of the governor van hemert rendered all these efforts useless he capitulated after a very feeble resistance and being tried for his conduct suffered a capital punishment from the sentence of a court martial the prince of parma next undertook the siege of venlo which was surrendered to him after some resistance the fate of nuys was more dismal being taken by assault while the garrison was treating of a capitulation rhimberg which was garrisoned by twelve hundred english under the command of colonel morgan was afterward besieged by the spaniards and leicester thinking himself too weak to attempt raising the siege endeavored to draw off the prince of parma by forming some other enterprise he first attacked doesberg and succeeded he then sat down before zutphen which the spanish general thought so important a place that he hastened to its relief he made the marquess of guasto advance with a convoy which he intended to throw into the place they were favored by a fog but falling by chance on a body of english cavalry a furious action ensued in which the spaniards were worsted and the marquess of gonzaga an italian nobleman of great reputation and family was slain the pursuit was stopped by the advance of the prince of parma with the main body of the spanish army and the english cavalry on their return from the field found their advantage more than compensated by the loss of sir philip sidney who being mortally wounded in the action was carried off by the soldiers and soon after died this person is described by the writers of that age as the most perfect model of an accomplished gentleman which was ever formed even by the wanton imagination of poetry or fiction virtuous conduct polite conversation heroic valor and elegant erudition all concurred to render him the ornament and delight of the english court and as the credit which he possessed with the queen and the earl of leicester was wholly employed in the encouragement of genius and literature his praises have been transmitted with advantage to posterity no person was so low as not to become an object of his humanity after this last action while he was lying on the field mangled with wounds a bottle of water was brought him to relieve his thirst but observing a soldier near him in a like miserable condition he said this mans necessity is still greater than mine and resigned to him the bottle of water the king of scots struck with admiration of sidneys virtue celebrated his memory by a copy of latin verses which he composed on occasion of the death of that young hero  the english though a long peace had deprived them of all experience were strongly possessed of military genius and the advantages gained by the prince of parma were not attributed to the superior bravery and discipline of the spaniards but solely to the misconduct of leicester the states were much discontented with his management of the war but still more with his arbitrary and imperious conduct and at the end of the campaign they applied to him for a redress of all their grievances but leicester without giving them any satisfaction departed soon after for england camden p     bentivoglio part   lib iv   the queen while she provoked so powerful an enemy as the king of spain was not forgetful to secure herself on the side of scotland and she endeavored both to cultivate the friendship and alliance of her kinsman james and to remove all grounds of quarrel between them an attempt which she had made some time before was not well calculated to gain the confidence of that prince she dispatched wotton as her ambassador to scotland but though she gave him private instructions with regard to her affairs she informed james that when she had any political business to discuss with him she would employ another minister that this man was not fitted for serious negociations and that her chief purpose in sending him was to entertain the king with witty and facetious conversation and to partake without reserve of his pleasures and amusements wotton was master of profound dissimulation and knew how to cover under the appearance of a careless gaiety the deepest designs and most dangerous artifices when but a youth of twenty he had been employed by his uncle dr wotton ambassador in france during the reign of mary to ensnare the constable montmorency and had not his purpose been frustrated by pure accident his cunning had prevailed over all the caution and experience of that aged minister it is no wonder that after years had so much improved him in all arts of deceit he should gain an ascendent over a young prince of so open and unguarded a temper as james especially when the queens recommendation prepared the way for his artifices he was admitted into all the pleasures of the king made himself master of all his secrets and had so much the more authority with him in political transactions that he did not seem to pay the least attention or regard to these matters the scotch ministers who observed the growing interest of this man endeavored to acquire his friendship and scrupled not to sacrifice to his intrigues the most essential interests of their master elizabeths usual jealousies with regard to her heirs began now to be levelled against james and as that prince had a tained the years proper for marriage she was apprehensive lest by being strengthened with children and alliances he should acquire the greater interest and authority with her english subjects she directed wotton to form a secret concert with some scotch nobleman and to procure their promise that james during three years should not on any account be permitted to marry in consequence of this view they endeavored to embroil him with the king of denmark who had sent ambassadors to scotland under pretense of demanding the restitution of the orkneys but really with a view of opening a proposal of marriage between james and his daughter wotton is said to have employed his intrigues to purposes still more dangerous he formed a conspiracy with some malcontents to seize the person of the king and to deliver him into the hands of elizabeth who would probably have denied all concurrence in the design but who would have been careful to retain him in perpetual thraldom if not captivity the conspiracy was discovered and wotton fled hastily from scotland without taking leave of the king melvil   jamess situation obliged him to dissemble his resentment of this traitorous attempt and his natural temper inclined him soon to forgive and forget it the queen found no difficulty to renew the negociations for a strict alliance between scotland and england and the more effectually to gain the princes affections she granted him a pension equivalent to his claim on the inheritance of his grandmother the countess of lenox lately deceased spotswood p      a league was formed between elizabeth and james for mutual defense of their dominions and of their religion now menaced by the open combination of all the catholic powers of europe it was stipulated that if elizabeth was invaded james should aid her with a body of two thousand horse and five thousand foot that elizabeth in a like case should send to his assistance three thousand horse and six thousand foot that the charge of these armies should be defrayed by the prince who demanded assistance that if the invasion should be made upon england within sixty miles of the frontiers of scotland this latter kingdom should march its whole forces to the assistance of the former and that the present league should supercede all former alliances of either state with any foreign kingdom so far as religion was concerned ibid p     camden p     rymer tom xv p  0    by this league james secured himself against all attempts from abroad opened a way for acquiring the confidence and affection of the english and might entertain some prospect of domestic tranquillity which so long as he lived on bad terms with elizabeth he could never expect long to enjoy besides the turbulent disposition and inveterate feuds of the nobility ancient maladies of the scotch government the spirit of fanaticism had introduced a new disorder so much the more dangerous that religion when corrupted by false opinion is not restrained by any rules of morality and is even searcely to be accounted for in its operations by any principles of ordinary conduct and policy the insolence of the scotch preachers who triumphed in their dominion over the populace had at this time reached an extreme height and they carried their arrogance so far not only against the king but against the parliament and the whole civil power that they dared to excommunicate the archbishop of st andrews because he had been active for promoting a law which restrained their seditious sermons spotswood p          nor could that prelate save himself any way from this terrible sentence but by renouncing all pretensions to ecclesiastical authority one gibson said in the pulpit that captain james stuart meaning the late earl of arran and his wife jezabel had been esteemed the chief persecutors of the church but it was now seen that the king himself was the great offender and for this crime the preacher denounced against him the curse which fell on jeroboam that he should die childless and be the last of his race ibid p       the secretary perceiving the king so much molested with ecclesiastical affairs and with the refractory disposition of the clergy advised him to leave them to their own courses for that in a short time they would become so intolerable that the people would rise against them and chase them out of the country true replied the king if i purposed to undo the church and religion your counsel were good but my intention is to maintain both therefore cannot i

of the queen of scots had engaged very early elizabeth to consult in her treatment of that unfortunate princess the dictates of jealousy and politics rather than of friendship or generosity the resentment of this usage had pushed mary into enterprises which had very nearly threatened the repose and authority of elizabeth the rigor and restraint which were thence redoubled upon the captive

and broke out about this time in an incident which may appear curious while the former queen was kept in custody by the earl of shrewsbury she lived during a long time in great intimacy with the countess but that lady entertaining jealousy of an amor between her and the earl their friendship was converted into enmity and mary took a method of revenge which at once gratified her spite against the countess and that against elizabeth she wrote to the queen informing her of all the malicious scandalous stories which she said the countess of shrewsbury had reported of her that elizabeth had given a promise of marriage to a certain person whom she afterward often admitted to her bed that she had been equally indulgent to simier the french agent and to the duke of anjou that hatton was also one of her paramours who was even disgusted with her excessive love and fondness that though she was on other occasions avaritious to the last degree as well as ungrateful and kind to very few she spared no expense in gratifying her amorous passions that notwithstanding her licentious amors she was not made like other women and all those who courted her marriage would in the end be disappointed that she was so conceited of her beauty as to swallow the most extravagant flattery from her courtiers who could not on these occasions forbear even sneering at her for her folly that it was usual for them to tell her that the luster of her beauty dazzled them like that of the sun and they could not behold it with a fixed eye she added that the countess had said that marys best policy would be to engage her son to make love to the queen nor was there any danger that such a proposal would be taken for mockery so ridiculous was the opinion which she had entertained of her own charms she pretended that the countess had represented her as no less odious in her temper than prostigate in her manners and absurd in her vanity that she had so beaten a young woman of the name of scudamore as to break that ladys finger and in order to cover over the matter it was pretended that the accident had proceeded from the fall of a candlestick that she had cut another across the hand with a knife who had been so unfortunate as to offend her mary added that the countess had informed her that elizabeth had suborned rolstone to pretend friendship to her in order to debauch her and thereby throw inamy on her rival see murdens state papers p     this imprudent and malicious letter was wrote a very little before the detection of queen marys conspiracy and contributed no doubt to

designs which afforded her enemies who waited for the opportunity a pretext or reason for effectuating her final ruin  zeal of the catholics the english seminary at rheims had wrought themselves up to a high pitch of rage and animosity against the queen the recent persecutions from which they had fled the new rigours which they knew awaited them in the course of their missions the liberty which for the present they enjoyed of declaiming against that princess and the contagion of religious fury which every where surrounded them in france all these causes had obliterated with them every maxim of common sense and every principle of morals or humanity intoxicated with admiration of the omnipotence and infallibility of the pope they revered his bull by which he excommunicated and deposed the queen and some of them had gone to that height of extravagance as to assert that that performance had been immediately dictated by the holy ghost the assassination of heretical sovereigns and of that princess in particular was represented as the most meritorious of all enterprises and they taught that whoever perished in such pious attempts enjoyed without dispute the glorious and neverfading crown of martyrdom by such doctrines they instigated john savage a man of desperate courage who had served some years in the low countries under the prince of parma to attempt the life of elizabeth and this assassin having made a vow to persevere in his design was sent over to england and recommended to the confidence of the more zealous catholics  about the same time john ballard a priest of that seminary had returned to paris from his mission in england and scotland and as he had discovered a spirit of mutiny and rebellion very prevalent among the catholic devotees in these countries he had founded on that disposition the project of dethroning elizabeth and of restoring by force of arms the exercise of the ancient religion in england murdens state papers p      the situation of affairs abroad seemed favorable to this enterprise the pope the spaniard the duke of guise the prince created by the pope duke of parma concurring in interests had formed a resolution to make some

the queen of scots being well acquainted with the prudence vigor and general popularity of elizabeth always maintained that so long as that princess was allowed to live it was in vain to expect any success from an enterprise upon england ballard persuaded of this truth saw more clearly the necessity of executing the design formed at rheims he came over to england in the disguise of a soldier and assumed the name of captain fortescue and he bent his endeavors to effectuate at once the project of an assassination an insurrection and an invasion camden p       babingtons conspiracy the first person to whom he addressed himself was anthony babington of dothic in the county of derby this young gentleman was of a good family possessed a plentiful fortune had discovered an excellent capacity and was accomplished in literature beyond most of his years or station being zealously devoted to the catholic communion he had secretly made a journey to paris some time before and had fallen into intimacy with thomas morgan a bigoted fugitive from england and with the bishop of glasgow marys ambassador to the court of france by continually extolling the amiable accomplishments and heroical virtues of that princess they inflamed the unguarded mind of young babington to make some attempt for her service and they employed every principle of ambition gallantry and religious zeal to give him a contempt of those dangers which attended any enterprise against the vigilant government of elizabeth finding him well disposed for their purpose they sent him back to england and secretly unknown to himself recommended him to the queen of scots as a person worth engaging in her service she wrote him a letter full of friendship and confidence and babington sanguine in his temper and zealous in his principles thought that these advances now bound him in honor to devote himself entirely to the service of that unfortunate princess during some time he had found means of conveying to her all her foreign correspondence but after she was put under the custody of sir amias paulet and reduced to a more rigorous confinement he experienced so much difficulty and danger in rendering her this service that he had desisted from every attempt of that nature  when ballard began to open his intentions to babington he found his zeal suspended not extinguished his former ardour revived on the mention of any enterprise which seemed to promise success in the cause of mary or of the catholic religion he had entertained however sentiments conformable to those of paget and represented the solly of all attempts which during the lifetime of elizabeth could be formed against the established religion and government of england ballard encouraged by this hint proceeded to discover to him the design undertaken by savage ibid state trials p      and was pleased to observe that instead of being shocked with that project babington only thought it not secure enough when entrusted to one single hand and proposed to join four others with savage in this desperate and bloody enterprise  in prosecution of these views babington employed himself in augmenting the number of his associates and he secretly drew into the conspiracy many catholic gentlemen discontented with the present government barnwel of a noble family in ireland charnoc a gentleman of lancashire and abington whose father had been cofferer to the household readily undertook the assassination of the queen charles tilney the heir of a very ancient family and titchborne of southampton when the design was proposed to them expressed some scruples which were at last removed by the arguments of babington and ballard savage alone refused for some time to share the glory of the enterprise with any others state trials vol i p      he challenged the whole to himself and it was with some difficulty he was induced to depart from this preposterous ambition  the delivery of the queen of scots at the very same instant when elizabeth should be assassinated was requisite for effecting the purpose of the conspirators and babington undertook with a party of an hundred horse to attack her guards while she should be taking the air on horseback in this enterprise he engaged edward windsor brother to the lord of that name thomas salisbury robert gage john travers john jones and henry done most of them men of family and interest the conspirators much wanted but could not find any nobleman of name whom they might place at the head of their enterprise but they trusted that the great events of the queens death and marys delivery would rouse all the zealous catholics to arms and that foreign forces taking advantage of the general confusion would easily fix the queen of scots on the throne and reestablish the ancient religion  these desperate projects had not escaped the vigilance of elizabeths council particularly of walsingham secretary of state that artful minister had engaged maud a catholic priest whom he retained in pay to attend ballard in his journey to france and had thereby got a hint of the designs entertained by the fugitives polly another of his spies had found means to insinuate himself among the conspirators in england and though not entirely trusted had obtained some insight into their dangerous secrets but the bottom of the conspiracy was never fully known till gifford a seminary priest came over and made a tender of his service to walsingham by his means the discovery became of the utmost importance and involved the fate of mary as well as of those zealous partisans of that princess  babington and his associates having laid such a scheme as they thought promised infallible success were impatient to communicate the design to the queen of scots and to obtain her approbation and concurrence for this service they employed gifford who immediately applied to walsingham that the interest of that minister might forward his secret correspondence with mary walsingham proposed the matter to paulet and desired him to connive at giffords corrupting one of his servants but paulet was averse to the introducing such a pernicious precedent into his family and desired that they would rather think of some other expedient gifford found a brewer who supplied the family with ale and bribed him to convey letters to the captive queen the letters by paulets connivance were thrust through a chink in the wall and answers were returned by the same conveyance  ballard and babington were at first diffident of giffords fidelity and to make trial of him they gave him only blank papers made up like letters but finding by the answers that these had been faithfully delivered they laid aside all farther scruple and conveyed by his hands the most criminal and dangerous parts of their conspiracy babington informed mary of the design laid for a foreign invasion the plan of an insurrection at home the scheme for her delivery and the conspiracy for assassinating the usurper by six noble gentlemen as he termed them all of them his private friends who from the zeal which they bore to the catholic cause and her majestys service would undertake the tragical execution mary assents to the conspiracy mary replied that she approved highly of the design that the gentlemen might expect all the rewards which it should ever be in her power to conler and that the death of elizabeth was a requisite circumstance before any attempts were made either for her own delivery or an insurrection state trials vol i p     camden p      these letters with others to mendoza charles paget the archbishop of glasgow and sir francis ingelfield were carried by gifford to secretary walsingham were decyphered by the art of philips his clerk and copies taken of them walsingham employed a new artifice in order to obtain full insight into the plot he subjoined to a letter of marys a postscript in the same cipher in which he made her desire babington to inform her of the names of the six conspirators the indiscretion of babington furnished walsingham with still another means of detection as well as of defense that gentleman had made a picture be drawn where he himself was represented standing amidst the six assassins and a motto was subjoined expressing that their common perils were the band of their consederacy a copy of this picture was brought to elizabeth that she might know the assassins and guard herself against their approach to her person  meanwhile babington anxious to ensure and hasten the foreign succors resolved to dispatch ballard into france and he procured for him under a feigned name a license to travel in order to remove from himself all suspicion he applied to walsingham pretended great zeal for the queens service offered to go abroad and promised to employ that confidence which he had gained among the catholics to the detection and disappointment of their conspiracies walsingham commended his loyal purposes and promising his own council and assistance in the execution of them still fed him with hopes and maintained a close correspondence with him a warrant meanwhile was issued for seizing ballard and this incident joined to the consciousness of guilt begot in all the conspirators the utmost anxiety and concern some advised that they should immediately make their escape others proposed that savage and charnoc should without delay execute their purpose against elizabeth and babington in prosecution of this scheme furnished savage with money that he might buy good clothes and have thereby the more easy access to the queens person next day they began to apprehend that they had taken the alarm too hastily and babington having renewed his correspondence with walsingham was persuaded by that subtle minister that the seizure of ballard had proceeded entirely from the usual diligence of informers in the detection of popish and seminary priests he even consented to take secretly lodgings in walsinghams house that they might have more frequent conferences together before his intended departure for france but observing that he was watched and guarded he made his escape and gave the alarm to the other conspirators they all took to flight covered themselves with several disguises and lay concealed in woods or barns the conspirators seized and executed but were soon discovered and thrown into prison in their examinations they contradicted each other and the leaders were obliged to make a full confession of the truth september fourteen were condemned and executed of whom seven acknowleged the crime on their trial the rest were convicted by evidence  the lesser conspirators being dispatched measures were taken for the trial and conviction of the queen of scots on whose account and by whose concurrence all these attempts had been made against the life of the queen and the tranquillity of the kingdom some of elizabeths counselors were averse to this procedure and thought that the close confinement of a woman who was become very sickly and who would probably put a speedy end to their anxiety by her natural death might give sufficient security to the government without attempting a measure of which there scarcely remains any example in history leicester advised that mary should be secretly dispatched by poison and he sent a divine to convince walsingham of the lawfulness of that action but walsingham declared his abhorrence of it and insisted still in conjunction with the majority of the counselors for the open trial of the queen of scots the situation of england and of the english ministers had indeed been hitherto not a little dangerous no successor of the crown was declared but the heir of blood to whom the people in general were likely to adhere was by education an enemy to the national religion was from multiplied injuries an enemy to the ministers and principal nobility and their personal safety as well as the security of the government seemed to hang alone on the queens life who was now somewhat advanced in years no wonder therefore that elizabeths counselors knowing themselves to be so obnoxious to the queen of scots endeavored to push every measure to extremity against her and were even more anxious than the queen herself to prevent her from ever mounting the throne of england  though all england was acquainted with the detection of babingtons conspiracy every avenue to the queen of scots was so strictly guarded that she remained in utter ignorance of the whole matter and it was a great surprise to her when sir thomas gorges by elizabeths orders informed her that all her partisans were discovered and arrested he chose the time for giving her this intelligence when she was mounted on horseback to go a hunting and she was not permitted to return to her former place of abode but was conducted from one gentlemans house to another till she was landed in fotheringhay castle in the county of northampton which it was determined to make the last stage of her trial and sufferings her two secretaries nau a frenchman and curle a scot were immediately arrested all her papers were seized and sent up to the council above sixty different keys to ciphers were discovered there were also found many letters from persons beyond sea and several too from english noblemen containing expressions of respect and attachment the queen took no notice of this last discovery but the persons themselves knowing their correspondence to be detected thought that they had no other method of making atonement for their imprudence than declaring themselves thenceforth the most inveterate enemies to the queen of scots camden p       resolution to try the queen of scots it was resolved to try mary not by the common statutes of treason but by the act which had passed the former year with a view to this very event and the queen in terms of that act appointed a commission consisting of forty noblemen and privycounsellors and empowered them to examine and pass sentence on mary whom she denominated the late queen of scots and heir to james the fifth of scotland the commissioners came to fotheringhay castle and sent to her sir walter mildmay sir amias paulet and edward barker who delivered her a letter from elizabeth informing her of the commission and of the approaching trial mary received the intelligence without any commotion or astonishment she said however that it seemed strange to her that the queen should command her as a subject to submit to a trial and examination before subjects that she was an absolute independent princess and would yield to nothing which might derogate either from her royal majesty from the state of sovereign princes or from the dignity and rank of her son that however oppressed by misfortunes and calamities her spirits were not yet so much broke as her enemies flattered themselves nor would she on any account be accessory to her own degradation and dishonor that she was ignorant of the laws and statutes of england was utterly destitute of council and could not conceive who were entitled to be called her peers or could legally sit as judges on her trial that though she had lived in england for many years she had lived in captivity and not having received the protection of the laws she could not merely by her involuntary residence in the country be supposed to have subjected herself to their jurisdiction and authority that notwithstanding the superiority of her rank she was willing to give an account of her conduct before an english parliament but could not view these commissioners in any other light than as men appointed to justify by some color of legal proceeding her condemnation and execution and that she warned them to look to their conscience and their character in trying an innocent person and to reflect that these transactions would somewhere be subject to revision and that the theater of the whole world was much wider than the kingdom of england  the commissioners prevail on her to submit to the trial in return the commissioners sent a new deputation informing her that her plea either from her royal dignity or from her imprisonment could not be admitted and that they were empowered to proceed against her even though she should refuse to appear before them burleigh the treasurer and bromley the chancellor employed much reasoning to make her submit to the trial but the person whose arguments had the chief influence was sir christopher hatton vicechamberlain his speech was to this purpose you are accused madam said he but not condemned of having conspired the destruction of our lady and queen anointed you say you are a queen but in such a crime as this and such a situation as yours the royal dignity itself neither by the civil nor canon law nor by the law of nature or of nations is exempt from judgment if you be innocent you wrong your reputation in avoiding a trial we have been present at your protestations of innocence but queen elizabeth thinks otherwise and is heartily sorry for the appearances which lie against you to examine therefore your cause she has appointed commissioners honorable persons prudent and upright men who are ready to hear you with equity and even with favor and will rejoice if you can clear yourself of the imputations which have been thrown upon you believe me madam the queen herself will rejoice who affirmed to me at my departure that nothing which ever befell her had given her so much uneasiness as that you should be suspected of a concurrence in these criminal enterprises laying aside therefore the fruitless claim of privilege from your royal dignity which can now avail you nothing trust to the better defense of your innocence make it appear in an open trial and leave not upon your memory that stain of infamy which must attend your obstinate silence on this occasion camden p     by this artful speech mary was persuaded to appear before the court and thereby gave an appearance of legal procedure to the trial and prevented those difficulties which the commissioners must have fallen into had she persevered in maintaining so specious a plea as that of her sovereign and independent character her conduct in this particular must be regarded as the more imprudent that formerly when elizabeths commissioners pretended not to exercise any jurisdiction over her and only entered into her cause by her own consent and approbation she declined justifying herself when her honor which ought to have been dearer to her than life seemed absolutely to require it  the trial on her first appearance before the commissioners mary either sensible of her imprudence or still unwilling to degrade herself by submitting to a trial renewed her protestation against the authority of her judges the chancellor answered her by pleading the supreme authority of the english laws over every one who resided in england and the commissioners accommodated matters by ordering both her protestation and his answer to be recorded  the lawyers of the crown then opened the charge against the queen of scots they proved by intercepted letters that she had allowed cardinal allen and others to treat her as queen of england and that she had kept a correspondence with lord paget and charles paget in a view of engaging the spaniards to invade the kingdom mary seemed not axious to clear herself from either of these imputations she only said that she could not hinder others from using what style they pleased in writing to her and that it was lawful for her to employ every expedient for the recovery of her liberty  an intercepted letter of here is to mendoza was next produced in which she promised to transfer to philip her right to the kingdom of england if her son should refuse to be converted to the catholic faith an event she said of which there was no expectation while he remained in the hands of his scotch subjects state trials vol i p      even this part of the charge she took no pains to deny or rather she seemed to acknowledge it she said that she had no kingdoms to dispose of yet was it lawful for her to give at her pleasure what was her own and she was not accountable to any for her actions she added that she had formerly rejected that proposal from spain but now since all her hopes in england were gone she was fully determined not to refuse foreign assistance there was also produced evidence to prove that allen and parsons were at that very time negotiating by her orders in rome the conditions of transferring her english crown to the king of spain and of disinheriting her heretical son canden p     this evidence was that of curle her secretary whom she allowed to be a very honest man and who as well as nau had given proofs of his integrity by keeping so long such important secrets from whose discovery he could have reaped the greatest profit mary after all thought that she had so little reason to complain of curles evidence that she took care to have him paid a considerable sum by her testament which she wrote the day before her death coodal vol i p     neither did she forget nau though less satisfied with his conduct id ibid   it is remarkable that marys prejudices against her son were at this time carried so far that she had even entered into a conspiracy against him had appointed lord claude hamilton regent of scotland and had instigated her adherents to seize the kings person and deliver him into the hands of the pope or the king of spain whence he was never to be delivered but on the condition of his becoming catholic the detail of this conspiracy is to be found in a letter of the queen of scots to charles paget her great consident this letter is dated the  0th of may      and is contained in dr orbes manuscript collections at present in the possession of lord royston it is a copy attested by curle marys secretary and indorsed by lord burleigh what proves its authenticity beyond question is that we find in murdens collection p  0 that mary actually wrote that very day a letter to charles pagt and further she mentions in the manuscript letter a letter of charles pagets of charles pagets of the  0th of april new we find by murden p  00 that charles paget did actually write her a letter of that date  this violence of spirit is very consistent with marys character her maternal affection was too weak to oppose the gratification of her passions particularly her pride her ambition and her bigotry her son having made some fruitless attempts to associate her with him in the title and having found this shme impracticable on account of the prejudices of his protestant subjects at last desisted from that design and entered into an alliance with england without comprehending his mother she was in such a rage at this undutiful behavior as she imagined it that she wrote to queen elizabeth that she no longer cared what became of him or her in the world the greatest satisfaction she could have before her death was to see him and all his adherents become a signal example of tyranny ingratitude and impiety and undergo the vengeance of god for their wickedness she would sind in christerdom other heirs and doubted not to put her inheritance in such hands as would retain the firmest hold of it she cared not after taking this revenge what became of her body the quickest death would then be the most agreeable to her and she assured her that if he persevered she would disown him for her son would give him her malediction would disinherit him as well of his present possessions as of all he could expect by her abandoning him not only to her subjects to treat him as they had done her but to all strangers to subdue and conquer him it was in vain to employ menaces against her the fear of death or other misfortune would never induce her to make one step or pronounce one syllable beyond what she had determined she would rather perish with honor in maintaining the dignity to which god had raised her than degrade herself by the least pusillanimity or act what was unworthy of her station and of her race murden p          james said to courcelles the french ambassador that he had seen a letter under her own hard where she threatened to disinherit him and said that he might betake him to the lordship of dley for that was all he had by his father counceller letter a ms of d campels there is in jebb vol ii p     a letter of here is where she throws out the same menace against him  we sind this scheme of seizing the king of scots and delivering him into the hands of the pope of the king of spain proposed by morgan to mary see murden p         the only part of the charge which mary positively denied was her concurrence in the design of assassinating queen elizabeth this article indeed was the most heavy and the only one which could fully justify the queen in proceeding to extremities against her in order to prove the accusation there were produced the following evidence copies taken in secretary walsinghams office of the intercepted letters between her and babington in which her approbation of the murder was clearly expressed the evidence of her two secretaries nau and curle who had sworn without being put to any torture that she both received these letters from babington and that they had wrote the answers by her order the confession of babington that he had wrote the letters and received the answers state trials vol i p      and the confession of ballard and savage that babington had showed them these letters of mary wrote in the cipher which had been settled between them  it is evident that this seeming complication of evidence resolves itself finally into the testimony of the two secretaries who alone were acquainted with their mistresss concurrence in babingtons conspiracy and who knew themselves exposed to all the rigours of imprisonment torture and death if they refused to give any evidence which might be required of them in the case of an ordinary criminal this proof with all its disadvantages would be esteemed legal and even satisfactory if not opposed by some other circumstances which shake the credit of the witnesses but on the present trial where the absolute power of the prosecutor concurred with such important interests and such a strong inclination to have the princess condemned the testimony of two witnesses even though men of character ought to be supported by very strong circumstances in order to remove all suspicion of tyranny and injustice the proof against mary it must be confessed is not destitute of this advantage and it is very difficult if not impossible to account for babingtons receiving an answer wrote in her name and in the cipher concerted between them without allowing that the matter had been communicated to that princess such is the light in which this matter appears even after time has discovered every thing which could guide our judgment with regard to it no wonder therefore that the queen of scots unassisted by council and confounded by so extraordinary a trial found herself incapable of making a satisfactory defense before the commissioners her reply consisted chiefly in her own denial whatever force may be in that denial was much weakened by her positively affirming that she never had had any correspondence of any kind with babington a fact however of which there remains not the least question the volume of state papers collected by mr murden prove beyond controversy that mary was long in close correspondence with babington p                 she entertained a like correspondence with ballard morgan and charles paget and laid a scheme with them for an insurrection and for the invasion of england by spain p         the same papers show that there had been a discontinuance of babingtons correspondence agreeable to camdens narration see state papers p     where morgan recommends it to queen mary to renew the correspondence with babington the former letters which passed between that queen and babington seem to have been destroyed by some accident these circumstances prove that no weight can be laid on marys denial of guilt and that her correspondence with babington contained particulars which could not be avowed  she asserted that as nau and curle had taken an oath of secrecy and fidelity to her their evidence against her ought not to be credited she confessed however that nau had been in the service of her uncle the cardinal of lorraine and had been recommended to her by the king of france as a man in whom she might safely confide she also acknowleged curle to be a very honest man but simple and easily imposed on by nau if these two men had received any letters or had wrote any answers without her knowledge the imputation she said could never lie on her and she was the more inclined she added to entertain this suspicion against them that nau had in other instances been guilty of a like temerity and had ventured to transact business in her name without communicating the matter to her there are three suppositions by which the letter to babington may be accounted for without allowing marys concurrence in the conspiracy for assassinating elizabeth the first is that which she seems herself to have embraced that her secretaries had received babingtons letter and had ventured of themselves to answer it without communicating the matter to her but it is utterly improbable that a princess of that sense and spirit would in an affair of that importance be so treated by her servants who lived in the house with her and who had every moment an opportunity of communicating the secret to her if the conspiracy failed they must expect to suffer the severest punishment from the court of england if it succeeded the lightest punishment which they could hope for from their own mistress must be disgrace on account of their temerity not to mention that marys concurrence was in some degree requisite for effectuating the design of her escape it was proposed to attack her guards while she was employed in hunting she must therefore concert the time and place with the conspirators the second supposition is that these two secretaries were previously traitors and being gained by walsingham had made such a reply in their mistresss cipher as might involve her in the guilt of the conspiracy but these two men had lived long with the queen of scots had been entirely trusted by her and had never fallen under suspicion either with her or her partisans camden tells us that curle afterward claimed a reward from walsingham on pretense of some promise but walsingham told him that he owed him no reward and that he had made no discoveries on his examination which were not known with certainty from other quarters the third supposition is that neither the queen nor the two secretaries nau and curle ever saw babingtons letter or made any answer but that walsingham having decyphered the former forged a reply but this supposition implies the falsehood of the whole story told by camden of giffords access to the queen of scotss family and paulets resusal to concur in allowing his servants to be bribed not to mention that as naus and curles evidence must on this supposition have been extorted by violence and terror they would necessarily have been engaged for their own justification to have told the truth afterward especially upon the accession of james but camden informs us that nau even after that event persisted still in his testimony  we must also consider that the two last suppositions imply such a monstrous criminal conduct in walsingham and consequently in elizabeth for the matter could be no secret to her as exceeds all credibility if we consider the situation of things and the prejudices of the times marys consent to babingtons conspiracy appears much more natural and probable she believed elizabeth to be an usurper and a heretic she regarded her as a personal and a violent enemy she knew that schemes of assassinating heretics were very familiar in that age and generally approved of by the zealous catholics her own liberty and sovereignty were connected with the success of this enterprise and it cannot ppear strange that where men of so much merit as babington could be engaged by bigotry alone in so criminal an enterprise mary who was actuated by the same motive joined to so many others should have given her consent to a scheme projected by her friends we may be previously certain that if such a scheme was ever communicated to her with any probability of success she would assent to it and it served the purpose of walsingham and the english ministry to facilitate the communication of these schemes as soon as they had got an expedient sor intercepting her answer and detecting the conspiracy now walsinghams knowledge of the matter is a supposition necessary to account for the letter delivered to babington  as to the not punishing of nau and curle by elizabeth it never is the practice to punish lesser criminals who had given evidence against the principal  but what should induce us to reject these three suppositions is that they must all of them be considered as bare possibilities the partisans of mary can give no reason for preferring one to the other not the slightest evidence ever appeared to support any one of them neither at that time nor at any time after was any reason discovered by the numerous zealots at home and abroad who had embraced marys defense to lead us to the belief os any of these three suppositions and even her apologists at present seem not to have fixed on any choice among these supposed possibilities the positive proof of two credible witnesses supported by the other very strong circumstances still remains unimpeached babington who had an extreme interest to have communication with the queen of scots believed he had found a means of correspondence with her and had received an answer from her he as well as the other conspirators died in that belief there has not occurred since that time the least argument to prove they were mistaken can there be any reason at present to doubt of the truth of their opinion camden though a professed apologist for mary is constrained to tell the story in such a manner as evidently supposes her guilt such was the impossibility of sinding any other consistent account even by a man of parts who was a contemporary  in this light might the question have appeared even during marys trial but what now puts her guilt beyond all controversy is the following passage of her letter to thomas morgan dated the   th of july     as to babington he has both kindly and honestly offered himself and all his means to be employed any way i would whereupon i hope to have satisfied him by two of my several letters since i had his and the rather for that i opened him the way whereby i received his with your aforesaid murden p     babington confessed that he had offered her to assassinate the queen it appears by this that she had accepted the offer so that all the suppositions of walsinghams gery or her secretarys temerity or treachery sall to the ground     the sole circumstance of her defense which to us may appear to have some force was her requiring that nau and curle should be confronted with her and affirming that they never would to her face persist in their evidence but that demand however equitable was not supported by law in trials of high treason and was often refused even in other trials where the crown was prosecutor the clause contained in an act of the   th of the queen was a novelty that the species of treason there enumerated must be proved by two witnesses confronted with the criminal the law of   and   of edward vi cap    which required the confrontation of two witnesses for all species of treason was repealed in the first of mary  but mary was not tried upon that act and the ministers and crown lawyers of this reign were always sure to refuse every indulgence beyond what the strict letter of the law and the settled practice of the courts of justice required of them not to mention that these secretaries were not probably at fotheringay during the time of the trial and could not upon marys demand be produced by the commissioners queen elzabeth was willing to have allowed curle and nau to be produced in the trial and writes to that purpose to burleigh and walsingham in her letter of the  th of october in forbers ms collections she only says that she thinks it needles though she was willing to agree to it the not consionting the with  was not result of design but the practice of the age   there passed two incidents in this trial which may be worth observing a letter between mary and babington was read in which mention was made of the earl of arundel and his brothers on hearing their names she broke into a sigh alas said she what has that noble house of the howards suffered for my sake she affirmed with regard to the same letter that it was easy to forge the handwriting and cipher of another she was afraid that this was too familiar a practice with walsingham who she also heard had frequently practiced both against her life and her sons walsingham who was one of the commissioners rose up when he heard this accusation he protested that in his private capacity he had never acted any thing against the queen of scots in his public capacity he owned that his concern for his sovereigns safety had made him very diligent in searching out by every expedient all designs against her sacred person or her authority for attaining that end he would not only make use of the assistance of ballard or any other conspirator he would also reward them for betraying their companions but if he had tampered in any manner unworthy of his character and office why did none of the late criminals either at their trial or execution accuse him of such practices mary endeavored to pacify him by saying that she spoke from information and she begged him that he would thenceforth give no more credit to such as standered her than she would to such as accused him the great character indeed which sir francis walsingham bears for probity and honor should remove from him all suspicion of such base arts as forgery and subornation arts which even the most corrupt ministers in the most corrupt times would scruple to employ    th october having finished the trial the commissioners adjourned from fotheringay and met in the star chamber at london where after taking the oaths of marys two secretaries who voluntarily without hope or reward vouched the authenticity of those letters before produced they pronounced sentence of death upon the queen of scots and confirmed it by their seals and subscriptions sentence against mary the same day a declaration was published by the commissioners and the judges that the sentence did no way derogate from the title and honor of james king of scotland but that he was in the same place degree and right as if the sentence had never been pronounced camden p       the queen had now brought her affairs with mary to that situation which she had long ardently desired and had sound a plausible reason for executing vengeance on a competitor whom from the beginning of her reign she had ever equally dreaded and hated but she was restrained from gratifying instantly her resentment by several important considerations she foresaw the invidious colors in which this example of uncommon jurisdiction would be represented by the numerous partisans of mary and the reproach to which she herself might be exposed with all foreign princes perhaps with all posterity the rights of hospitality of kindred and of royal majesty seemed in one signal instance to be all violated and this sacrifice of generosity to interest of clemency to revenge might appear equally unbecoming a sovereign and a woman elizabeth therefore who was an excellent hypocrite pretended the utmost reluctance to proceed to the execution of the sentence affected the most tender sympathy with her prisoner displayed all her scruples and objections rejected the solicitation of her courtiers and ministers and affirmed that were she not moved by the deepest concern for her peoples safety she would not hesitate a moment in pardoning all the injuries which she herself had received from the queen of scots    th october that the voice of her people might be more audibly heard in the demand of justice upon mary she summoned a new parliament and she knew both from the usual dispositions of that assembly and from the influence of her ministers over them that she should not want the most earnest solicitation to consent to that measure which was so agreeable to her secret inclinations she opened not this assembly in person but appointed for that purpose three commissioners the chancellor bromley the treasurer burleigh and the earl of derby the reason assigned for this measure was that the queen foreseeing that the affair of the queen of scots would be tried in parliament found her tenderness and delicacy so much hurt by that melancholy incident that she had not the courage to be present while it was under deliberation but withdrew her eyes from what she could not behold without the utmost reluctance and uneasiness she was also willing that by this unusual caution the people should see the danger to which her person was hourly exposed and should thence be more strongly incited to take vengeance on the criminal whose restless intrigues and bloody conspiracies had so long exposed her to the most imminent perils dewes p       the parliament answered the queens expectations the sentence against mary was unanimously ratisied by both houses and an application was agreed on to obtain elizabeths consent to its publication and execution ibid p      she gave them an answer ambiguous embarrassed full of real artifice and seeming irresolution she mentioned the extreme danger to which her life was continually exposed she declared her willingness to die did she not foresee the great calamities which would thence fall upon the nation she made professions of the greatest tenderness to her people she displayed the clemency of her temper and expressed her violent reluctance to proceed to extremity against her unhappy kinswoman she affirmed that the late law by which that princess was tried so far from being made to ensnare her was only intended to give her warning beforehand not to engage in such attempts as might expose her to the penalties with which she was thus openly menaced and she begged them to think once again whether it was possible to find any other expedient besides the death of the queen of scots for securing the public tranquillity dewes p  0   0   the parliament in obedience to her commands took the affair again under deliberation but could find no other possible expedient they reiterated their solicitations and entreaties and arguments they even remonstrated that mercy to the queen of scots was cruelty to them her subjects and children and they affirmed that it were injustice to deny execution of the law to any individual much more to the whole body of the people now unanimously and earnestly suing for this pledge of her parental care and tenderness this second address set the pretended doubts and scruples of elizabeth anew in agitation she complained of her own unfortunate situation expressed her uneasiness from their importunity renewed the professions of affection to her people and dismissed the committee of parliament in an uncertainty what after all this deliberation might be her final resolution this parliament granted the queen a supply of a subsidy and two fifteenths they adjourned and met again after the execution of the queen of scots when there passed some remarkable incidents which it may be proper not to omit we shall give them in the words of sir simo dewes p   0     which are almost wholly transcribed from townsends journal on monday the   th of february mr cope first using some speeches touching the necessity of a learned ministry  the amendment of things amiss in the ecclesiastical estate offered to the house a bill and a book written the bill containing a petition that it might be enacted that all laws now in force touching ecclesiastical government should be void and that it might be enacted that that book of common prayer now offered and none other might be received into the church to be used the book  the form of prayer and administration of the sacraments with diverse rite and ceremonies to be hied in the church and he desired that the book might be read whereupon mr speaker in effect us  this speech for that her majesty before this time had commanded the house not to meddle with thi matter and that her majesty had promised to take order in those causes he doubted ot ut to the  satisfaction of all her people he desired that it would please them to  the reading of  withstanding the house desired the reading of it whereupon mr speaker desired the clerk to read and the court being ready to read it mr dalton made a motion against the reading of  saying that it was not meet to be read and it did appoint a new form of administration of the  men and ceremonies of the church to the discredit of the book of common prayer and of the where  and thought that this dealing would bring her majestys indignation against the house thus to ctprize this dealing with those things which her majesty especially had taken into her own charge and direction whereupon mr lewkenor spoke showing the necessity of preaching and of a learned ministry and thought it very fit that the petition and book should be read to this purpose spoke mr hurleston and mr bainbrigg and so the time being passed the house broke up and the petition nor book read this done her majesty sent to mr speaker as well for this petition and book as for that other petition and book for the like effect that was delivered the last session of parliament which mr speaker sent to her majesty on tuesday the   th of february her majesty sent for mr speaker by occasion whereof the house did not sit on wednesday the first day of march mr wentworth delivered to mr speaker certain articles which contained questions touching the liberties of the house and to some of which he was to answer and desired they might be read mr speaker desired him to spare his motion until her majestys pleasure was farther known touching the petition and book lately delivered into the house but mr wentworth would not be so satisfied but required his articles might be read mr wentworth introduced his queries by lamenting that he as well as many others were deterred from speaking by their want of knowledge and experience in the liberties of the house and the queries were as follows whether this council were not a place for any member of the same here assembled freely and without controulment of any person or danger of laws by bill or speech to utter any of the griefs of this commonwealth whatsoever touching the service of god the safety of the prince and this noble realm whether that great honor may be done unto god and benefit and service unto the prince and state without free speech in this council that may be done with it whether there be any council which can make add or diminish from the laws of the realm but only this council of parliament whether it be not against the orders of this council to make any secret or matter of weight which is here in hand known to the prince or any other concerning the high service of god prince or state without the consent of the house whether the speaker or any other may interrupt any member of this council in his speech used in this house tending to any of the forenamed services whether the speaker may rise when he will any matter being propounded without consent of the house or not whether the speaker may overruled the house in any matter or cause there in question or whether he is to be ruled or overruled in any matter or not whether the prince and state can continue and stand and be maintained without this council of parliament not altering the government of the state at the end of these questions says sir simon dewes i found set down this short note or memorial ensuing by which it may be perceived both what sergeant puckering the speaker did with the said questions after he had received them and what became also of this business viz these questions mr puckering pocketed up and showed sir thomas heneage who so handled the matter that mr wentworth went to the tower and the questions not at all moved mr buckler of essex herein brake his says in forsaking the matter etc and no more was done after setting down continues sir simon dewes the said business of mr wentworth in the original journal book there follows only this shortconclusion of the day itself viz this day mr speaker being sent for to the queens majesty the house departed on thursday the second of march mr cope mr lwenor mr hurlston and mr bainbrigg were sent for to my lord chancellor and by diverse of the privy council and from thence were sent to the tower on saturday the fourth day of march sir john higham made a motion to this house for that diverse good and necessary members thereof were taken from them that it would please them to be humble petitioners to her majesty son the ressitution of them again to the house to which speeches mr vicechamberlain answered that it the gentlemen were committed for matter within the compass of the privilege of this house then there might be a petition but if not then we should give occasion to her majestys farther displeasure and therefore advised to stay until they heard more which could not be long and farther he said touching the book and the petition her majesty had for diverse good causes best known to herself thought sit to suppress the same without any farther examination thereof and yet thought it very unsit for her majesty to give any account of her doings  but whatsoever mr vicechamberlain pretended it is most probable these members were committed for intermeddling with matters touching the church which her majesty had often inhibited and which had caused so much disputation and so many meetings between the two houses the last parliament  this is all we find of the matter in sir simon dewes and townsend and it appears that those members who had been committed were detained in custody till the queen thought sit to release them these questions of mr wentworth are curious because they contain the first faint dawnings of the present english constitution though suddenly eclipsed by the arbitrary government of elizabeth wentworth was indeed by his puritanism as well as his love of liberty for these two characters of such unequal merit arose and advanced together the true forerunner of the hambdens the pyms and the hollises who in the next age with less courage because with less danger rendered their principles so triumphant i shall only ask whether it be not sufficiently clear from all these transactions that in the two succeeding reigns it was the people who encroached upon the sovereign not the sovereign ho attempted as is pretended to usurp upon the people     but though the queen affected reluctance to execute the sentence against mary she complied with the parliaments request to publish it and the proclamation seemed to be attended with the unanimous and hearty rejoicings of the people the lord buckhurst and beale clerk to the council were sent to the queen of scots and notified to her the sentence pronounced against her its ratification by parliament and the earnest applications made for its execution by that assembly who thought that their religion could never while she was alive attain a full settlement and security mary was no way dismayed at this intelligence on the contrary she joyfully laid hold of the last circumstance mentioned to her and insisted that since her death was demanded by the protestants for the establishment of their faith she was really a martyr to her religion and was entitled to all the merits attending that glorious character she added that the english had often imbrued their hands in the blood of their sovereigns no wonder they exercised cruelty toward her who derived her descent from these monarchs camden p      paulet her keeper received orders to take down her canopy and to serve her no longer with that respect due to sovereign princes he told her that she was now to be considered as a dead person and incapable of any dignity jebb vol ii p      this insult she received without any seeming emotion she only replied that she received her royal character from the hands of the almighty and no earthly power was ever able to bereave her of it  the queen of scots wrote her last letter to elizabeth full of dignity without departing from that spirit of meekness and of charity which appeared suitable to this concluding scene of her unfortunate life she preferred no petition for averting the fatal sentence on the contrary she expressed her gratitude to heaven for thus bringing to a speedy period her sad and lamentable pilgrimage she requested some favors of elizabeth and entreated her that she might be beholden for them to her own goodness alone without making applications to those ministers who had discovered such an extreme antipathy to her person and her religion she desired that after her enemies should be satiated with her innocent blood her body which it was determined should never enjoy rest while her soul was united to it might be consigned to her servants and be conveyed by them into france there to repose in a catholic land with the sacred relicts of her mother in scotland she said the sepulchers of her ancestors were violated and the churches either demolished or profaned and in england where she might be interred among the ancient kings her own and elizabeths progenitors she could entertain no hopes of being accompanied to the grave with those rites and ceremonies which her religion required she desired that no one might have the power of inflicting a private death upon her without elizabeths knowledge but that her execution should be public and attended with her ancient servants who might bear testimony of her perseverance in the faith and of her submission to the will of heaven she begged that these servants might afterward be allowed to depart whither they pleased and might enjoy those legacies which she should leave them and she conjured her to grant these favors by their near kindred by the soul and memory of henry the seventh the common ancestor of both and by the royal dignity of which they equally participated camden p     jebb vol ii p      elizabeth made no answer to this letter being unwilling to give mary a refusal in her present situation and foreseeing inconveniences from granting some of her requests  while the queen of scots thus prepared herself to meet her fate great efforts were made by foreign powers with elizabeth to prevent the execution of the sentence pronounced against her besides employing laubespine the french resident at london a man devoted to the house of guise henry sent over bellievre with a professed intention of interceding for the life of mary the duke of guise and the league at that time threatened very nearly the kings authority and elizabeth knew that though that monarch might from decency and policy think himself obliged to interpose publicly in behalf of the queen of scots he could not secretly be much displeased with the death of a princess on whose fortune and elevation his mortal enemies had always founded so many daing and ambitious projects ibid p      it is even pretended that bellievre had orders after making public and vehement remonstrances against the execution of mary to exhort privately the queen in his masters name not to defer an act of justice so necessary for their common interests du maurier  but whether the french kings intercession was sincere or not it had no weight with the queen and she still persisted in her former resolution  interposition of king james the interposition of the young king of scots though it was not able to change elizabeths determination seemed on every account to merit more attention so soon as james heard of the trial and condemnation of his mother he sent william keith gentleman of his bed chamber to london and wrote a letter to the queen in which he remonstrated in very severe terms against the indignity of the procedure he said that he was astonished to hear of the presumption of english noblemen and counselors who had dared to sit in judgment and pass sentence upon a queen of scotland descended from the royal blood of england but was still more astonished to hear that thoughts were seriously entertained of putting that sentence in execution that he entreated elizabeth to reflect on the dishonor which she would draw on her name by embruing her hands in the blood of her near kinswoman a person of the same royal dignity and the same sex with herself that in this unparalelled attempt she offered an affront to all diadems and even to her own and by reducing sovereigns to a level with other men taught the people to neglect all duty toward those whom providence had appointed to rule over them that for his part he must esteem the injury and insult so enormous as to be incapable of all atonement nor was it possible for him thenceforth to remain on any terms of correspondence with a person who without any pretense of legal authority had deliberately inflicted an ignominious death upon his parent and that even if the sentiments of nature and duty did not inspire him with this purpose of vengeance his own honor required it of him nor could he ever acquit himself in the eyes of the world if he did not use every effort and endure every hazard to revenge so great an indignity spotswood p      soon after james sent the master of gray and sir robert melvil to enforce the remonstrances of keith and to employ with the queen every expedient of argument and menaces elizabeth was at first offended with sharpness of these applications and she replied in a like strain to the scotch ambassadors when she afterward reflected that this earnestness was no more than what duty required of james she was pacified but retained still her resolution of proceeding to extremities against mary ibid p      it is believed that the master of gray gained by the enemies of that princess gave secretly his advice not to spare her and undertook at all adventures to pacify his master the queen also from many circumstances was induced to pay small attention to the applications of james and to disregard all the efforts which he could employ in behalf of his mother she was well acquainted with his character and interests the factions which prevailed among his people and the inveterate hatred which the zealous protestants particularly the preachers bore to the queen of scots the present incidents put these dispositions of the clergy in a full light james observing the fixed purpose of elizabeth ordered prayers to be offered up for his mother in all the churches and knowing the captious humor of the ecclesiastics he took care that the form of the petition should be most cautious as well as humane and charitable that it might please god to illuminate mary with the light of his truth and save her from the apparent danger with which she was threatened but excepting the kings own chaplains and one clergyman more all the preachers refused to pollute their churches by prayers for a papist and would not so much as prefer a petition for her conversion james unwilling or unable to punish this disobedience and desirous of giving the preachers an opportunity of amending their fault appointed a new day when prayers should be said for his mother and that he might at least secure himself from any insult in his own presence he desired the archbishop of st andrews to preach before him in order to disappoint this purpose the clergy instigated one couper a young man who had not yet received holy orders to take possession of the pulpit early in the morning and to exclude the prelate when the king came to church and saw the pulpit occupied by couper he called to him from his seat and told him that the place was destined for another yet since he was there if he would obey the charge given and remember the queen in his prayers he might proceed to divine service the preacher replied that he would do as the spirit of god should direct him this answer sufficiently instructed james in his purpose and he commanded him to leave the pulpit as couper seemed not disposed to obey the captain of the guard went to pull him from his place upon which the young man cried aloud that this day would be a witness against the king in the great day of the lord and he denounced a woe upon the inhabitants of edinburgh for permitting him to be treated in that manner spotswood p      the audience at first appeared desirous to take part with him but the sermon of the prelate brought them over to a more dutiful and more humane disposition  elizabeth when solicited either by james or by foreign princes to pardon the queen of scots seemed always determined to proceed to extremities against her but when her ministers urged her to interpose no more delays in the execution her scruples and her hesitation returned her humanity could not allow her to embrace such violent and sanguinary measures and she was touched with compassion for the misfortunes and with respect for the dignity of the unhappy prisoner the courtiers sensible that they could do nothing more acceptable to her than to employ persuasion on this head failed not to enforce every motive for the punishment of the queen of scots and to combat all the objections urged against that act of justice reasons for the execution of mary they said that the treatment of that princess in england had been on her first reception such as sound reason and policy required and if she had been governed by principles of equity she would not have refused willingly to acquiesce in it that the obvious inconveniences either of allowing her to retire into france or of restoring her by force to her throne in opposition to the protestants and the english party in scotland had obliged the queen to detain her in england till time should offer some opportunity of serving her without danger to the kingdom or to the protestant religion that her usage had there been such as became her rank her own servants in considerable numbers had been permitted to attend her exercise had been allowed her for her health and all access of company for amusement and these indulgencies would in time have been carried farther if by her subsequent conduct she had appeared worthy of them that after she had instigated the rebellion of northumberland the conspiracy of norfolk the bull of excommunication of pope pius an invasion from flanders after she had seduced the queens friends and incited every enemy foreign or domestic against her it became necessary to treat her as a most dangerous rival and to render her confinement more strict and rigorous that the queen notwithstanding these repeated provocations had in her favor rejected the importunity of her parliaments and the advice of her sagest ministers digges p      vol ii p                and was still in hopes of her amendment determined to delay coming to the last extremity against her that mary even in this forlorn condition retained so high and unconquerable a spirit that she acted as competitor to the crown and allowed her partisans every where and in their very letters addressed to herself to treat her as queen of england that she had carried her animosity so far as to encourage the atrocious design of assassinating the queen and this crime was unquestionably proved upon her by her own letters by the evidence of her secretaries and by the dying confession of her accomplices that she was but a titular queen and at present possessed no where any right of sovereignty much less in england where every one was subject to the laws and to elizabeth the only true sovereign that even allowing her to be still the queens equal in rank and dignity selfdefence was permitted by a law of nature which could never be abrogated and every one still more a queen had sufficient jurisdiction over an enemy who by open violence and still more who by secret treachery threatened the utmost danger against her life that the general combination of the catholics to exterminate the protestants was no longer a secret and as the sole resource of the latter persecuted sect lay in elizabeth so the chief hope which the former entertained of final success consisted in the person and in the title of the queen of scots that this very circumstance brought matters to extremity between these princesses and rendering the life of the one the death of the other pointed out to elizabeth the path which either regard to selfpreservation or to the happiness of her people should direct her to follow and that necessity more powerful than policy thus demanded of the queen that resolution which equity would authorize and which duty prescribed camden p       ibid  a criminal attempt of this nature was even imputed to laubespine the french ambassador and that minister was obliged to leave the kingdom the queen affecting to be in great terror and perplexity was observed to sit much alone pensive and silent and sometimes to mutter to herself half sentences importing the difficulty and distress to which she was reduced ibid p     she at last called davison a man of parts but easy to be imposed on and who had lately for that very reason been made secretary and she ordered him to draw out secretly a warrant for the execution of the queen of scots which she afterward said she intended to keep by her in case any attempt should be made for the delivery of that princess she signed the warrant and then commanded davison to carry it to the chancellor in ord r to have the seal affixed to it next day she sent killigrew to davison enjoining him to forbear some time executing her former orders and when davison came and told her that the warrant had already passed the seals she seemed to be somewhat moved and blamed him for his precipitation davison being in some perplexity acquainted the council with this whole transaction and they endeavored to persuade him to send off beale clerk of the council with the warrant if the queen should be displeased they promised to justify his conduct and to take on themselves the whole blame of this measure it appears by some letters published by strype vol iii book ii c   that elizabeth had not expressly communicated her intention to any of her ministers not even to burleigh they were such experienced courtiers that they knew they could not gatly her more than by serving her without waiting till the desired them  the secretary not perceiving their intention complied with the advice and the warrant was dispatched to the earls of shrewsbury and kent and some others ordering them to see the sentence executed upon the queen of scots   th february the execution the two earls came to fotheringhay and being introduced to mary informed her of their commission and told her to prepare for death next morning at eight oclock she was nowise dismayed though somewhat surprised with the intelligence she said with a cheerful and even a smiling countenance that she did not think the queen her sister would have consented to her death or have executed the sentence against a person who was not subject to the laws and jurisdiction of england but as such is her will said she death which puts an end to all my miseries shall be to me most welcome nor can i esteem that soul worthy the felicities of heaven which cannot support the body under the horrors of the last passage to these blissful mansions camden p     ebb vol ii p 0  ms in the advocates library p   from the cott lib call c    she then requested the two noblemen that they would permit some of her servants and particularly her confessor to attend her but they told her that compliance with this last demand was contrary to their conscience ebb vol ii p  0   and that dr fletcher dean of peterborow a man of great learning should be present to instruct her in the principles of true religion her refusal to have any conference with this divine inflamed the earl of kents zeal and he bluntly told her that her death would be the life of their religion as on the contrary her life would have been the death of it mention being made of babington she constantly denied his conspiracy to have been at all known to her and the revenge of her wrong she resigned into the hands of the almighty  when the earls had left her she ordered supper to be hastened that she might have the more leizure to finish the few affairs which remained to her in this world and to prepare for her passage to another it was necessary for her she said to take some sustenance left a failure of her bodily strength should depress her spirits on the morrow and lest her behavior should thereby betray a weakness unworthy of herself ibid p     she supped sparingly as her manner usually was and her wonted cheerfulness did not even desert her on this occasion she comforted her servants under the affliction which overwhelmed them and which was too powerful for them to conceal from her turning to bourgoin her physician she asked him whether he did not remark the great and invincible force of truth they pretend said she that i must die because i conspired against the queens life but the earl of kent avowed that there was no other cause of my death but the apprehensions which if i should live they entertain for their religion my constancy in the faith is my real crime the rest is only a color invented by interested and designing men toward the end of supper she called in all her servants and drank to them they pledged her in order on their knees and craved her pardon for any past neglect of their duty she deigned in return to ask their pardon for her offenses toward them and a plentiful effusion of tears attended this last solemn farewell and exchange of mutual forgiveness jebb vol ii p  0      camden p       her care of her servants was the sole remaining affair which employed her concern in this world she perused her will in which she had provided for them by legacies she ordered the inventory of her goods clothes and jewels to be brought her and she wrote down the names of those to whom she bequeathed each particular to some she distributed money with her own hands and she adapted the recompense to their different degrees of rank and merit she wrote also letters of recommendation for her servants to the french king and to her cousin the duke of guise whom she made the chief executor of her testament at her wonted time she went to bed slept some hours and then rising spent the rest of the night in prayer having foreseen the difficulty of exercising the rites of her religion she had had the precaution to obtain a consecrated host from the hands of pope pius and she had reserved the use of it for this last period of her life by this expedient she supplied as much as she could the want of a priest and confessor who was refused her jebb vol ii p       toward the morning she dressed herself in a rich habit of silk and velvet the only one which she had reserved to herself she told her maids that she would willingly have left them this dress rather than the plain garb which she wore the day before but it was necessary for her to appear at the ensuing solemnity in a decent habit  thomas andrews sheriff of the county entered the room and informed her that the hour was come and that he must attend her to the place of execution she replied that she was ready and bidding adieu to her servants she leaned on two of sir amias paulets guards because of an infirmity in her limbs and she followed the sheriff with a serene and composed aspect in passing through a hall adjoining to her chamber she was met by the earls of shrewsbury and kent sir amias paulet sir drue drury and many other gentlemen of distinction here she also found andrew melvil her steward who flung himself on his knees before her and wringing his hands cried aloud ah madam unhappy me what man was ever before the messenger of such heavy tidings as i must carry when i shall return to my native country and shall report that i saw my gracious queen and mistress beheaded in england his tears prevented further speech and mary too felt herself moved more from sympathy than affliction cease my good servant said she cease to lament thou have cause rather to rejoice than to mourn for now shall thou see the troubles of mary stuart receive their long expected period and determination know continued she good servant that all the world at best is vanity and subject still to more sorrow than a whole ocean of tears is able to bewail but i pray thee carry this message from me that i die a true woman to my religion and unalterable in my affections to scotland and to france heaven forgive them that have long desired my end and have thirsted for my blood as the heart pants after the water brooks o god added she thou that art the author of truth and truth itself thou know the inmost recesses of my heart thou know that i was ever desirous to preserve an entire union between scotland and england and to obviate the source of all these fatal discords but recommend me melvil to my son and tell him that notwithstanding all my distresses i have done nothing prejudicial to the state and kingdom of scotland after these words reclining herself with weeping eyes and face bedewed with tears she kissed him and so said she good melvil farewell once again farewell good melvil and grant the assistance of thy prayers to thy queen and mistress ms p   jebb vol ii p     strype vol iii p       she then turned about to the noblemen who attended her and made a petition in behalf of her servants that they might be well treated that they might be allowed to enjoy the presents which she had made them and be sent safely into their own country having received a favorable answer she moved another request that they might be permitted to attend her at her death in order said she that their eyes may behold and their hearts bear witness how patiently their queen and mistress can bear her execution and how constantly she perseveres in her attachments to her religion the earl of kent opposed this desire and told her that they would be apt by their speeches and cries both to disturb herself and the spectators he was also apprehensive lest they should practice some superstition unmeet for him to suffer such as dipping their handkerchiefs in her blood for that was the instance which he made use of my lord said the queen of scots i will give my word although it be but dead that they shall not incur any blame in any of the actions which you have named but alas poor souls it would be a great consolation to them to bid their mistress farewell and i hope added she that your mistress being a maiden queen would vouchsafe in regard of womanhood that i should have some of my own people about me at my death i know that her majesty has not given you any such strict command but that you might grant me a request of far greater courtesy even though i were a woman of much inferior rank to that which i bear finding that the earl of kent persisted still in his refusal her mind which had fortified itself against the terrors of death was affected by this circumstance of indignity for which she was not prepared i am cousin to your queen cried she and descended from the blood royal of henry the seventh and a married queen of france and an anointed queen of scotland the commissioners perceiving how invidious their obstinacy would appear conferred a little together and agreed that she might carry a few of her servants along with her she made choice of four men and two maidservants for that purpose  she then passed into another hall where was erected the scaffold covered with black and she saw with an undismayed countenance the two executioners and all the preparations of death the room was crowded with spectators and no one was so steeled against all sentiments of humanity as not to be moved when he reflected on her royal dignity considered the surprising train of her misfortunes beheld her mild but inflexible constancy recalled her amiable accomplishments or surveyed her beauties which though faded by years and yet more by her afflictions still discovered themselves in this fatal moment here the warrant for her execution was read to her and during this ceremony she was silent but showed in her behavior an indifference and unconcern as if the business had no way regarded her before the executioners performed their office the dean of peterborow stepped forth and though the queen frequently told him that he needed not concern himself about her that she was settled in the ancient catholic and roman religion and that she meant to lay down her life in defense of that faith he still thought it his duty to persist in his lectures and exhortations and to endeavor her conversion he told her that the queen of england had in this moment shown a tender care of her and notwithstanding the punishment justly to be inflicted on her for her manifold trespasses was determined to use every expedient for saving her soul from that destruction with which it was so nearly threatened that she was now standing upon the brink of eternity and had no other means of escaping endless perdition but by repenting her former wickedness by justifying the sentence pronounced against her by acknowleging the queens favors and by exerting a true and lively faith in christ jesus that the scriptures were the only rule of doctrine the merits of christ the only means of salvation and if she trusted in the inventions or devices of men she must expect in a moment to fall into utter darkness into a place where shall be weeping howling and gnashing of teeth that the hand of death was upon her the ax was laid to the root of the tree the throne of the great judge of heaven was erected the book of her life was spread wide and the particular sentence and judgment was ready to be pronounced upon her and that it was now during this important instant in her choice either to rise to the resurrection of life and hear that joyful salutation come ye blessed of my father or to share the resurrection of condemnation replete with sorrow and grief and to suffer that dreadful denunciation go ye cursed into everlasting fire ms p      0    strype vol iii p     during this discourse the queen could not forbear sometimes betraying her impatience by interrupting the preacher and the dean finding that he had profited nothing by his lecture at last bid her change her opinion repent her of her former wickedness and settle her faith upon this ground that only in christ jesus could she hope to be saved she answered again and again with great earnestness trouble not yourself any more about the matter for i was born in this religion i have lived in this religion and in this religion i am resolved to die even the two earls perceived that it was fruitless to harrass her any further with theological disputes and they ordered the dean to desist from his unseasonable exhortations and to pray for her conversion during the deans prayer she employed herself in private devotion from the office of the virgin and after he had finished she pronounced aloud some petitions in english for the afflicted church for an end of her own troubles for her son and for queen elizabeth and prayed god that that princess might long prosper and be employed in his service the earl of kent observing that in her devotions she made frequent use of the crucifix could not forbear reproving her for her attachment to that popish trumpery as he termed it and he exhorted her to have christ in her heart not in her hand ms p    jebb vol ii p             she replied with presence of mind that it was difficult to hold such an object in her hand without feeling her heart touched with some compunction jebb ibid   she now began with the aid of her two women to disrobe herself and the executioner also lent his hand to assist them she smiled and said that she was not accustomed to undress herself before so large a company nor to be served by such valets her servants seeing her in this condition ready to lay her head upon the block burst into tears and lamentations she turned about to them put her finger upon her lips as a sign of imposing silence upon them jebb p  0       and having given them her blessing desired them to pray for her one of her maids whom she had appointed for that purpose covered her eyes with a handkerchief she laid herself down without any sign of fear or trepidation and her head was severed from her body at two strokes by the executioner  marys character thus died in the fortysixth year of her age and the nineteenth of her captivity in england mary queen of scots a princess of great accomplishments both of body of mind natural as well as acquired but unfortunate in her life and during one period very unhappy in her conduct the beauties of her person and of her air combined to make her the most amiable of women and the charms of her address and conversation aided the impression which her lovely figure made on the hearts of all beholders ambitious and active in her temper yet inclined to cheerfulness and society of a lofty spirit constant and even vehement in her purpose yet polite and gentle and affable in her demeanor she seemed to partake only so much of the male virtues as to render her estimable without relinquishing those soft graces which compose the proper ornaments of her sex in order to form a just idea of her character we must set aside one part of her conduct while she abandoned herself to the guidance of a profligate man and must consider these faults whether we admit them to be imprudences or crimes as the result of an inexplicable though not uncommon inconstancy in the human mind of the frailty of our nature of the violence of passion and of the influence which situations and sometimes momentary incidents have on persons whose principles are not thoroughly confirmed by experience and reflection enraged by the ungrateful conduct of her husband seduced by the treacherous counsels of one in whom she reposed confidence transported by the violence of her own temper which never lay sufficiently under the guidance of discretion she was betrayed into actions which may with some difficulty be accounted for but which admit of no apology nor even of alleviation an enumeration of her qualities might carry the appearance of a panegyric an account of her conduct must in some parts wear the aspect of a severe satire and invective  her numerous misfortunes the solitude of her long and tedious captivity and the persecutions to which she had been exposed on account of her religion had wrought her up to a degree of bigotry during her latter years and such was the prevalent spirit and principles of that age that it is the less wonder if her zeal her resentment and her interest uniting induced her to give consent to a design which conspirators actuated only by the first of these motives had formed against the life of elizabeth  the queens affected sorrow when the queen heard of marys execution she affected the utmost surprise and indignation her countenance changed her speech faltered and failed her and for a long time her sorrow was so deep that she could not express it but stood fixed like a statue in silence and mute astonishment after her grief was able to find vent it burst out in loud wailings and lamentations she put herself into deep mourning for this deplorable event and she was seen perpetually bathed in tears and surrounded only by her maids and women none of her ministers or counselors dared to approach her or if any assumed such temerity she chaced them from her with the most violent expressions of rage and resentment they had all of them been guilty of an unpardonable crime in putting to death her dear sister and kinswoman contrary to her fixed purpose and intention camden p     stype vol iii appendix p     jebb vol ii p     of which they were sufficiently apprized and acquainted  no sooner was her sorrow so much abated as to leave room for reflection than she wrote a letter of apology to the king of scots and sent it by sir robert carry son to lord hunsdon she there told him that she wished he knew but not felt the unutterable grief of mind she experienced on account of that lamentable accident which without her knowledge much less concurrence had happened in england that as her pen trembled when she attempted to write it she found herself obliged to commit the relation of it to the messenger her kinsman who would likewise inform his majesty of every circumstance which attended this dismal and unlooked for misfortune that she appealed to the supreme judge of heaven and earth for her innocence and was also so happy amidst her other afflictions as to find that many persons in her court could bear witness to her veracity in this protestation that she abhorred hypocrisy and dissimulation esteemed nothing more worthy of a prince than a sincere and open conduct and could never surely be esteemed so base and poorspirited as that if she had really given orders for this latal execution she could on any consideration be induced to deny it that though she was sensible of the justice of the sentence she was determined from clemency never to carry it into execution and could not but resent the temerity of those who on this occasion had disappointed her intentions and that as no one loved him more dearly than herself or bore a more anxious concern for his welfare she hoped that he would consider every one as his enemy who endeavored on account of the present incident to excite any animosity between them camden p     spotswood p       in order the better to appease james she committed davison to prison and ordered him to be tried in the star chamber for his misdemeanour the secretary was confounded and being sensible of the danger which must attend his entering into a contest with the queen he expressed penitence for his error and submitted very patiently to be railed at by those very counselors whose persuasion had induced him to incur the guilt and who had promised to countenance and protect him he was condemned to imprisonment during the queens pleasure and to pay a fine of ten thousand pounds he remained a long time in prison and the fine though it reduced him to want and beggary was strictly levied upon him all the favor which he could obtain from the queen was the sending him small supplies from time to time to keep him from perishing in necessity camden p      he privately wrote an apology to his friend walsingham which contains many curious particulars the french and scotch ambassadors he said had been remonstrating with the queen in marys behalf and immediately after their departure she commanded him of her own accord to deliver her the warrant for the execution of that princess she signed it readily and ordered it to be sealed with the great seal of england she appeared in such good humor on this occasion that she said to him in a jocular manner go tell all this to walsingham who is now sick though i fear he will die for sorrow when he hears it she added that though she had so long delayed the execution lest she should seem to be actuated by malice or cruelty she was all along sensible of the necessity of it in the same conversation she blamed drury and paulet that they had not before eased her of this trouble and she expressed her desire that walsingham would bring them to a compliance in that particular she was so bent on this purpose that some time after she asked davison whether any letter had come from paulet with regard to the service expected of him davison showed her paulets letter in which that gentleman flatly refused to act any thing inconsistent with the principles of honor and justice the queen fell into a passion and accused paulet as well as drury of perjury that having taken the oath of association in which they had bound themselves to avenge her wrongs they had yet refused to lend their hand on this occasion but others she said will be sound less scrupulous davison adds that nothing but the consent and exhortations of the whole council could have engaged him to send off the warrant he was well aware of his danger and remembered that the queen after having ordered the execution of the duke of norfolk had endeavored in like manner to throw the whole blame and odium of that action upon lord burleigh camden p    strype vol iii  library a  from the ott lib    elizabeths dissimulation was so gross that it could deceive no body who was not previously resolved to be blinded but as jamess concern for his mo her was certainly more sincere and cordial he discovered the highest resentment a refused to admit carry into his presence he recalled his

himself to the king arrayed in complete armor and said that that was the proper mourning for the queen the catholics took the opportunity of rting james to ally himself with the king of spain to lay imm diate claim to the crown of england and to prevent the danger which from his mothers example he might conclude would certainly if elizabeths power prevailed overwhelm his person and his kingdom the queen was s nsible of the danger attending these councils and after allowing james some decent interval to vent his grief and anger she employed her emissaries to pacify him and to set before him every motive of hope or fear which might induce him to live in peace and friendship with her   walsingham wrote to lord thirlstone the scotch secretary of state a very judicious letter to the same purpose he said that he was much surprised to hear of the violent resolutions taken in scotland and of the passion discovered by a prince of so much judgment and temper as james that a war founded merely on the principle of revenge and that too on account of an act of justice which necessity had extorted would for ever be exposed to blame and could not be excused by any principles of equity or reason that if these views were deemed less momentous among princes policy and interest ought certainly to be attended to and these motives did still more evidently oppose all thoughts of a rupture with england and all revival of expioded claims and pretensions to the english throne that the inequality between the two  ived james of any hopes of inss if he trusted merely to the force of his own slate and had no recourse to foreign powers for assistance that the objections attending the introduction of succors from a more powerful monarch appeared so evident from all the transactions of history that they could not escape a person of the kings extensive knowledge but there were in the present case several peculiar circumstances which ought for ever to prevent him from having recourse to so dangerous an expedient that the french monarch the ancient ally of scotland might willingly use the assistance of that kingdom against england but would be displeased to see the union of these two crowns on the head of james an union which would ever after exclude him from all hopes of practicing that policy formerly so useful to france and so pernicious to the scotch nation that henry besides infested with faction and domestic war was not in a condition of supporting distant allies much less would he undergo any hazard or expense in order to aggrandize a near kinsman to the house of guise the most determined enemies of his repose and authority that the extensive power and exorbitant ambition of the spanish monarch rendered him a still more dangerous ally to james and as he evidently aspired to an universal monarchy in the west and had in particular advanced some claims on england as if he were descended from the house of lancaster he was at the same time the common enemy of all princes who desired to maintain their liberty and independance and the immediate rival and competitor of the king of scots that the queen by her own naval power and her alliance with the hollanders would probably intercept all succors which james might receive from abroad and be enabled to decide the controversy in this island with the superior forces of her own kingdom opposed to those of scotland that if the king revived his mothers pretensions to the crown of england he must also embrace her religion by which alone they could be justified and must thereby undergo the infamy of abandoning those principles in which he had been strictly educated and to which he had hitherto religiously adhered that as he would by such an apostasy totally alienate all the protestants in scotland and england he could never gain the confidence of the catholics who would still entertain a very reasonable doubt of his honor and sincerity that by advancing a present claim to the crown he forfeited the certain prospect of his succession and revived that national animosity which the late peace and alliance between the kingdoms had happily extinguished that the whole gentry and nobility of england had openly declared themselves for the execution of the queen of scots and if james showed such violent resentment against that act of justice they would be obliged for their own security to prevent for ever so implacable and revengeful a prince from ruling over them and that however some persons might represent his honor as engaged to seek vengeance for the present affront and injury the true honor of a prince consisted in wisdom and moderation and justice not in following the dictates of blind passion or in pursuing revenge at the expense of every motive and every interest strype vol iii p    spotswood these considerations joined to the peaceable unambitious temper of the young prince prevailed over his resentment and he fell gradually into a good correspondence with the court of england  while elizabeth ensured tranquillity from the attempts of her nearest neighbor she was not negligent of more distant dangers hearing that philip while he seemed to dissemble the daily insults and injuries which he received from the english was secretly preparing a great navy to attack her she sent sir francis drake with a fleet to intercept his supplies to pillage his coast and to destroy his shipping drake  at cadiz drake carried out four capital ships of the queens and twentysix great and small with which the london merchants in hopes of sharing in the plunder had supplied him having learned from two dutch ships whom he met in his passage that a spanish fleet richly laden was lying at cadiz ready to set sail for lisbon the rendezvous of the intended armada he bent his course to the former harbor and boldly as well as fortunately made an attack on the enemy he obliged six galleys which made head against him to take shelter under the forts he burned about an hundred vessels laden with ammunition and naval stores and he destroyed a great ship of the marquess of santa croce thence he set sail for cape st vincent and took by assault the castle situated on that promontory with three other strong holds he next insulted lisbon and finding that the merchants who had engaged entirely in expectation of profit were discontented with these military enterprises he set sail for the tercera islands with an intention of lying in wait for a rich carrack which was expected in these quarters he was so fortunate as to meet with his prize and in this short expedition where the public bore so small a share the adventurers were encouraged to attempt farther enterprises the english seamen learned to despise the great unwieldy ships of the enemy the naval preparations of spain were destroyed the intended expedition against england was retarded a twelvemonth and the queen had thereby leizure to take more secure measures against that formidable invasion camden p    sir william monson  tracts in churchills voyages vol iii p     this year thomas cavendish a gentleman of devonshire who had dissipated his estate by living at court being resolved to repair his fortune at the expense of the spaniards fitted out three ships at plymouth one of an hundred and twenty tons another of sixty and a third of forty and with these small vessels he adventured into the south seas and committed great depredations on the spaniards he took nineteen vessels some of which were richly laden and returning by the cape of good hope he came to england and entered the river in a kind of triumph his mariners and soldiers were clothed in silk his sails were of damask his topmast cloth of gold and his prize was esteemed the richest that ever had been brought into england  vol i p    the land enterprises of the english were not during this campaign so advantageous or honorable to the nation the important place of deventer was entrusted by leicester to william stanley with a garrison of twelve hundred english and his gentleman being a catholic was alarmed with the discovery of babingtons conspiracy and became apprehensive lest every one of his religion should thenceforth be treated with distrust in england he entered into a correspondence with the spaniards betrayed the city to them for a sum of money and engaged the whole garrison to desert with him to the spanish service roland york who commanded a fort near zutphen imitated his example and the hollanders formerly disgusted with leicester and suspicious of the english broke out into loud complaints against the improvidence if not the treachery of his administration soon after he arrived himself in the low countries but his conduct was nowise calculated to give them satisfaction or to remove the suspicions which they had entertained against him the prince of parma having besieged sluys he attempted to relieve the place first by sea then by land but failed in both enterprises and as he ascribed his bad success to the ill behavior of the hollanders they were equally free in reflections upon his conduct the breach between them became wider every day they slighted his authority opposed his measures and neglected his councils while he endeavored by an imperious behavior and by violence to recover that influence which he had lost by his imprudent and ill concerted measures he was even suspected by the dutch of a design to usurp upon their liberties and the jealousy entertained against him began to extend toward the queen herself that princess had made some advances toward a peace with spain a congress had been opened at bourbourg a village near gaveline and though the two courts especially that of spain had no other intention than to amuse each of them its enemy by negotiation and mutua ly relax the preparations for defense or assault the dutch who were determined on no condition to return under the spanish yoke became apprehensive lest their liberty should be sacrificed to the political interests of england  part ii lib   strype vol iv   but the queen who knew the importance of her alliance with the slates in the present  was resolved to give them entire satisfaction by recalling  commanding him to resign his government maurice son to the prince of orange a youth of twenty years of age was elected by the states governor in his place and peregrine lord willoughby was appointed by the queen commander of the english forces the measures of these two generals were much disturbed by the malignity of leicester who had left a faction behind him and who still attempted by means of his emissaries to disturb all the operations of the slates so soon as elizabeth got intelligence of these disorders she took care to redress them and she obliged all the partisans of england to fall into unanimity with prince maurice rymer tom xv p   but though her good sense so far prevailed over her partiality to leicester she never could be made fully sensible of his vices and imprudence the submissions which he made her restored him to her wonted favor and the lord bukhurst who had accused him of misconduct in holland lost for some time her confidence and was even committed to custody  sir christopher hatton was another favorite who at this time received some marks of her partiality though he had never followed the profession of the law he was made chancellor in the place of bromley deceased but notwithstanding all the expectations and wishes of the lawyers he behaved in a manner not unworthy that high station his good natural capacity supplied the place of experience and study and his decisions were not found deficient either in point of equity or judgment his enemies had contributed to this promotion in hopes that his absence from court while he attended the business of chancery would gradually estrange him from the queen and give them an opportunity of undermining him in her favor   philip though he had not yet declared war on account of the hostilities whi h elizabeth every where committed upon him had long harbored a secret and violent desire of revenge against her his ambition also and the hopes of extending his empire were much encouraged by the present prosperous situation of his affairs by the conquest of portugal the acquisition of the indian commerce and  ttlements and the yearly importation of vast treasures from america the point on which he rsted his highest glory the perpetual object of his policy was to support orthodoxy and exterminate heresy and as the power and credit of elizabeth was the chief bulwark

to proceed immediately to the execution of his ambitious projects during some time he had been secretly making preparations the invincible armada but so soon as the resolution was fully taken every part of his vast empire resounded with the noise of armaments and all hisministers generals and admirals were employed in forwarding the design the marquess of santo croce a sea officer of great reputation and experience was destined to command the fleet and by his counsel were the naval equipments conducted in all the ports of sicily of naples of spain and portugal artizans were employed in building vessels of uncommon size and force naval stores were bought up at a prodigious expense provisions amassed armies levied and quartered in the maritime towns of spain and plans laid for fitting out such a fleet and embarkation as had never before had its equal in europe the military preparations in flanders were no less formidable forces from all quarters were every moment assembling to reinforce the duke of parma capizuchi and spinelli conducted forces from italy the marquess of borgaut a prince of the house of austria levied troops in germany the walloon and burgundian regiments were completed or augmented the spanish infantry was supplied with recruits and an army of thirty four thousand men were assembled in the netherlands and kept in a readiness to be transported into england the duke of parma employed all the carpenters which he could procure either in flanders or in lower germany and the coasts of the baltic and he built at dunkirk and newport but especially at antwerp a great number of boats and flat bottomed vessels for the transport of his infantry and cavalry into england the most renowned nobility and princes of italy and spain were ambitious of sharing in the honor of this great enterprise don amadeaeus of savoy don john of medicis vespasian gonzaga duke of sabionetta and the duke of pastrana hastened to join the army under the duke of parma about two thousand volunteers many of them men of family had inlisted for the service in spain no doubt was entertained but such vast preparations conducted by officers of such consummate skill must finally be successful and the spaniards ostentatious of their power and elevated with vain hopes had already denominated their navy the invincible armada  news of these extraordinary preparations soon reached england and notwithstanding the secrecy of the spanish council and their pretending intentions to employ this force in the indies it was easily concluded that they meant to make some effort against england preparations in england the queen had foreseen the invasion and finding that she must now contend for her crown with the whole force of spain she made preparations for resistance nor was she dismayed with that danger by which all europe apprehended she must of necessity be overwhelmed her force seemed very unequal to resist so powerful an enemy all the seamen in england amounted at that time only to fourteen thousand two hundred and ninetyfive monson p     the size of the english shipping was in general so small that except a few of the queens ships of war there were not four vessels belonging to the merchants which exceeded four hundred tuns ibid p     the royal navy consisted only of twentyeight vessels ibid p      many of which were of very small size none of them exceeding the bulk of our largest frigates and most of them deserving rather the name of pinnaces than of ships the only advantage of the english fleet consisted in the dexterity and courage of the seamen who being accustomed to sail in tempestuous seas and expose themselves to all dangers as much exceeded in this particular the spanish mariners as their vessels were inferior in size and force to those of that nation ibid p     all the commercial towns of england were required to furnish ships for reinforcing this small navy and they discovered on the present occasion great alacrity in defending their liberty and religion against those imminent perils with which they were menaced the city of london in order to show their vigor in the common cause instead of fifteen vessels which they were commanded

commanded by the lord seymour second son of protector somerset and lay off dunkirk in order to intercept the duke of parma  the land forces of england compared to those of spain possessed contrary qualities to its naval power they were more numerous than the enemy but much inferior in discipline reputation and experience an army of twenty thousand men was disposed in different bodies along the south coast and orders were given them if they could not hinder the spaniards from landing to retire backwards to waste the country around and to wait for reinforcement from the neighboring counties before they approached the enemy a body of twentytwo thousand foot and a thousand horse under the command of the earl of leicester was stationed at tilbury in order to defend the capital the main army consisted of thirtyfour thousand foot and two thousand horse and was commanded by lord hunsdon these forces were reserved for the guard of the queens person and were appointed to march whithersoever the enemy should appear the fate of england if the whole spanish armies should be able to land seemed to depend on the issue of a single battle and men of reflection entertained the most dismal apprehensions when they considered the force of fifty thousand veteran spaniards commanded by experienced officers under the duke of parma the most consummate general of the age and compared this formidable armament with the military power which england not enervated by peace but long disused to war could muster up against it  the chief support of the kingdom seemed to consist in the vigor and prudence of the queens conduct who undismayed by the present dangers issued all her orders with tranquillity animated her pe ple to a steady resistance and employed every resource which either her domestic situation or her foreign alliances could afford her she sent sir robert sydney into scotland and exhorted the king to remain attached to her and to consider the danger which at present menaced his sovereignty no less than her own from the ambition of the spanish tyrant she made him some promises which she  fulfilled to give him a dukedom in england with suitable lands and revenue to settle  000 l a year on him and pay him a guard for the safety of his person from a m of lord loyston  the ambassador found james sufficiently disposed to cultivate an union with england and he even kept himself prepared to march with the force of his whole kingdom to the assistance of elizabeth her authority with the king of denmark and the tie of their common religion engaged this prince upon her application to seize a squadron of ships which philip had bought or hired in the danish harbors strype vol iii p     the hanse towns though not at that time on good terms with england were induced by the same motives to retard so long the equipment of some vessels in their ports that they became useless to the purpose of invading england all the protestants throughout europe regarded this enterprise as the critical event which was to decide for ever the fate of their religion and though unable by reason of their distance to join their force to that of elizabeth they kept their eyes fixed on her conduct and fortune and beheld with anxiety mixed with admiration the intrepid countenance with which she encountered that dreadful tempest which was every moment approaching toward her  the queen also was sensible that next to the general popularity which she enjoyed and the confidence which her subjects reposed in her prudent government the firmest support of her throne consisted in the general zeal of the people for the protestant religion and the strong prejudices which they had imbibed against popery she took care on this occasion to revive in the nation this attachment to their own sect and this abhorrence of the opposite the english were reminded of their former danger from the tyranny of spain all the barbarities exercised by mary against the protestants were ascribed to the counsels of that bigoted and imperious nation the bloody massacres in the indies the unrelenting executions in the low countries the horrid cruelties and iniquities of the inquisition were set before mens eyes a list and description was published and pictures dispersed of the several instruments of torture with which it was pretended the spanish armada was loaded and every artifice as well as reason was employed to animate the people to a vigorous defense of their religion their laws and their liberties  but while the queen in this critical emergence rouzed the animosity of the nation against popery she treated the partisans of that sect with moderation and gave not way to an undistinguishing fury against them though she knew that sixtus quintus the present pope famous for his capacity and his tyranny had fulminated a new bull of excommunication against her had deposed her from the throne had absolved her subjects from their oaths of allegiance had published a croisade against england and had granted plenary indulgence to every one engaged in the present invasion she would not believe that all her catholic subjects could be so blinded as to sacrifice to bigotry their duty to their sovereign and the liberty and independency of their native country she rejected all violent counsels by which she was prompted to seek pretexts for dispatching the leaders of that party she would not even consine any considerable number of them and the catholics sensible of this good usage generally expressed the highest zeal for the public defense some gentlemen of that sect conscious that they could not justly expect any trust or authority entered themselves as volunteers in the fleet or army stowe p      some equipped ships at their own charge and gave the command of them to protestants others were active in animating their tenants and vassals and neighbors to the defense of their country and every rank of men burying for the present all party distinctions seemed to prepare themselves with order as well as vigor to resist the violence of these invaders  the more to excite the martial spirit of the nation the queen appeared on horseback in the camp at tilbury and riding through the lines discovered a cheerful and animated countenance exhorted the soldiers to remember their duty to their country and their religion and professed her intention though a woman to lead them herself into the field against the enemy and rather to perish in battle than survive the ruin and slavery of her people the queens speech to the  military was in  wrd my loving people we

soldiery an attachment to her person became a species of enthusiasm among them and they asked one another whether it were possible that englishmen could abandon this glorious cause could display less courage than appeared in the female sex or could ever by any dangers be induced to relinquish the defense of their heroic princess  the spanish armada was ready on the beginning of may but the moment it was preparing to sail the marquess of santa croce the admiral was seized with a violent fever of which he soon after died the vice admiral the duke of paliano by a strange concurrence of accident at the very same time  the same fate and the king appointed for admiral the duke of meina sidonia the nobleman of the greatest family in spain but unexperienced in action and utterly unacquainted with sea affairs alcarede was appointed vice admiral this misfortune besides the loss of so great an officer as santa croce retarded the sailing of the armada and gave the english more time for their preparations to oppose them at last the fleet full of hopes and alacrity set sail from lisbon   th may but next day met with a violent tempest which scattered the ships sunk some of the smallest and forced the rest to take shelter in the groyne where they waited till they could be refitted when news of this event was carried to england the queen concluded that the design of an invasion was disappointed for this summer and being always ready to lay hold of every pretense for saving money she made walsingham write to the admiral directing him to lay up some of the larger ships and to discharge the seamen but lord effingham who was not so sanguine in his hopes used the freedom to disobey these orders and he beged leave to retain the whole ships in service though it should be at his own expense camden p      he took advantage of a north wind and sailed toward the coast of spain with an intention of attacking the enemy in their harbors but the wind changing to the south he became apprehensive lest they might have set sail and by passing him at sea invade england now exposed by the absence of the fleet he returned therefore with the utmost expedition to plymouth and lay at anchor in that harbor  meanwhile the armada had repaired all her damages and with fresh hopes set out again to sea in prosecution of her enterprise the fleet consisted of a hundred and thirty vessels of which near a hundred were galleons and were of greater size than any which had ever before been used in europe it carried on board nineteen thousand two hundred and ninetyfive soldiers eight thousand four hundred and fiftysix mariners two thousand and eightyeight galley slaves and two thousand six hundred and thirty great pieces of brass ordnance it was victualled for six months and was attended with twenty lesser ships called caravals and ten salves with six oars apiece strype vol iii appen p       the plan formed by the king of spain was that the armada should sail to the coast opposite to dunkirk and newport and having chased away all english or flemish vessels which might obstruct the passage for it was never supposed they could make opposition should join themselves with the duke of parma should thence make sail to the thames and having landed the whole spanish army thus complete at one blow the entire conquest of england in prosecution of this plan philip gave orders to the duke of medina that in passing along the channel he should sail as near the coast of france as he could with safety that he should by this policy avoid meeting with the english fleet and keeping in view the main enterprise should neglect all smaller successes which might prove an obstacle or even interpose a delay to the acquisition of a kingdom monson p      after the armada was under sail they took a fisherman who informed them that the english admiral had been lately at sea had heard of the tempest which scattered the armada had retired back into plymouth and no longer expecting an invasion this season had laid up his ships and discharged most of the seamen from this false intelligence the duke of medina conceived the great facility of attacking and destroying the english ships in harbor and he was tempted by the prospect of so decisive an enterprise to break his orders and make sail directly for plymouth a resolution which proved the safety of england   th july the armada arrives in the channel the lizard was the first land made by the armada about sunset and as the spaniards took it for the ramhead near plymouth they bore out to sea with an intention of returning next day and attacking the english navy they were descried by fleming a scottish pyrate who was roving in these seas and who immediately set sail to inform the english admiral of their approach monson p     another fortunate event which contributed extremely to the safety of the fleet effingham had just time to get out of port when he saw the spanish armada coming full sail toward him disposed in the form of a half moon and stretching the distance of seven miles from the extremity of one division to that of the other  the writers of that age raise their style by a pompous description of this spectacle the most magnificent which had ever appeared upon the ocean infusing equal terror and admiration into the minds of all beholders the lofty masts the swelling sails and the towering prows of the spanish galleons seem impossible to be justly painted otherwise than by assuming the colors of poetry and an eloquent historian of italy in imitation of camden has asserted that the armada though the ships bore every sail yet advanced with a slow motion as if the ocean groaned with supporting and the winds were tired with impelling so enormous a weight  pr      the truth however is the largest of the spanish vessels would scarce pass for third rates in the present navy of england yet were they so ill framed or so ill governed that they were quite unwieldy and could not sail upon a wind nor tack on occasion nor be managed in stormy weather by the seamen neither the mechanics of shipbuilding nor the experience of mariners had attained so great perfection as could serve for the security and government of such bulky vessels and the english who had already had experience how unserviceable they commonly were were not dismayed with their tremendous appearance  effingham gave orders not to come to a close sight with the spaniards where the size of the ships he suspected and the numbers of soldiers would be a disadvantage to the english but to cannonade them at a distance and to wait the opportunity which winds currents or various chances must afford them of intercepting some scattered vessels of the enemy nor was it long before the event answered expectation a great ship of bisay on board of which was a considerable part of the spanish money was set on fire by accident and while all hands were employed in extinguishing it she fell behind the rest of the armada the great galleon of andaluzia was detained by the springing of her mast and both these vessels were taken after some resistance by sir francis drake as the armada advanced up the channel the english hung upon their rear and still infested them with skirmishes each trial abated the confidence of the spaniards and added courage to the english and the latter soon found that even in close fight the size of the spanish ships was no advantage to them their bulk exposed them the more to the bullets of the enemy while their cannon placed too high shot over the heads of the english the alarm having now reached the coast of england the nobility and gentry hastened out with their vessels from every harbor and reinsorced the admiral the earls of oxford northumberland and cumberland sir thomas cecil sir robert cecil sir walter raleigh sir thomas vavasor sir thomas gerrard sir charles blount with many others distinguished themselves by this generous and disinterested service of their country the english fleet after the conjunction of these ships amounted to an hundred and forty fail  the armada had now reached calais a d cast anchor before that place in expectation that the duke of parma who had got intelligence of their approach would put to sea and join his forces to them the english admiral practiced here a very successful stratagem upon the spaniards he took eight of his smaller ships and filling them with all combustible materials sent them one after another into the midst of the enemy the spaniards fancied that they were fireships of the same contrivance with a famous vessel which had lately done so much execution at antwerp and they immediately cut their cables and took to slight with the greatest disorder and precipitation the english sell upon them next morning while in confusion and besides doing great damage to other ships they took or destroyed about twelve of the enemy  by this time it was become apparent that the intention for which these great preparations were made by the spaniards was entirely srustrated the vessels provided by the duke of parma were made for transport not for sighting and that general when urged to leave the harbor utterly refused to expose his flourishing army to such apparent hazard as it must incur while the english not only were able to keep the sea but seemed even to triumph over their enemy the spanish admiral found in many rncounters that while he lost so considerable a part of his own navy he had destroyed only one small vessel of the english and he foresaw that by continuing so unequal a combat he must draw inevitable destruction on all the remainder he prepared therefore to defeated a violent tempest overtook the armada after it passed the orkneys the ships had already lost their anchors and were obliged to keep to sea the mariners unaccustomed to such hardships and not able to govern such unwieldy vessels yielded to the fury of the storm and allowed their ships to drive either on the western isles of scotland or on the coast of ireland where they were miserably shipwrecked not a half of the navy returned to spain and the seamen as well as soldiers who remained were so overcome with hardship and fatigue so dispirited by their discomfiture that they filled all spain with accounts of the valor of the english and of the tempestuous violence of that ocean which surrounds them  such was the miserable and dishonorable conclusion of an enterprise which had been preparing for three years which had exhausted the revenue and force of spain and which had long filled all europe with anxiety or expectation philip who was a slave to his passions but had an entire command over his countenance no sooner heard of the mortifying event which blasted all his schemes of ambition than he fell on his knees and rendering thanks for that gracious dispensation of providence expressed his joy that the calamity was not greater the spanish priests who had so ofttn blessed this holy croisade and foretold its intallible success were somewhat at a loss to account for the victory gained over the catholic monarch by excommunicated heretics and an execrable usurper but they at last discovered that all the calamities of the spaniards had proceeded from their allowing the infidel moors to live among them strype vol iii p     on the fourth of september soon after the dispersion of the spanish armada died the earl of  the queens great but unworthy favorite her tttion to him continued to the last he had discovered no conduct in any of his military enterprize and was suspected of cowardice yet she  him with the command of her armies during the danger of the spanish invasion a partiality which might have proved fatal to her had the duke of  been able to land his troops in england she had even ordered a commission to be drawn lot him  him her lieutenant in the kingdom of england and ireland but burleigh and haon sented to her the danger of entrusting such unlimited authority in the hands of any subject and prevented the execution of that design no wonder that a conduct so unlike the usual jealousy of elizabeth gave reason to suspect that her partiality was founded on some other passion than friendship but elizabeth seemed to carry her affection to leicester no farther than the grave she ordered his goods to be disposed of at a public sale to reimburse herself of some money which he owed her and her usual attention to money was observed to prevail over her regard to the memory of the deceased this earl was a great hypocrite a pretender to the strictest religion an encourager of the puritans and a founder of hospitals    th february soon after the defeat and dispersion of the spanish armada the queen summoned a new parliament and received from them a supply of two subsidies and four fifteenths payable in four years this is the first instance that subsidies were doubled in one supply and so unusual a concession was probably obtained from the joy of the present success and from the general sense of the queens necessities some members objected to this heavy charge on account of the great burden of loans which had lately been imposed upon them strype vol iii p     id appen p     there are some singular passages in this last speech which may be worth taking notice of especially as they came from a member who was no courtier for he argues against the subsidy and first says he for the necessity thereof i cannot deny but if it were a charge imposed upon us by her majestys commandment or a demand proceeding from her majesty by way of request that i think there is not one among us all either so disobedient a subject in regard of our duty or so unthankful a man in respect of the inestimable benefits which by her or from her we have received which would not with frank consent both of voice and heart most willingly submit himself thereunto without any unreverend enquiry into the causes thereof for it is continually in the mouth of us all that our lands goods and lives are at our princes disposing and it agrees very well with that position of the civil law which says quod omnia regis sunt but how pa tamen ut omnium sint ad regem enim potestas omntum pertinet ad singulos poprieta so that although it be most true that her majesty has over ourselves and our goods ptstatem imperandi yet it is true that until that power command which no doubt will not command without very just cause every subject has his own proprietatem possidend which power and commandment from her majesty which we have not yet received i take it saving reformation that we are freed from the cause of necessity and the cause of necessity is the dangerous estate of the common wealth etc the tenor of the speech pleads rather for a general benevolence than a subsidy for the law of richard the third against benevolence was never conceived to have any force the member even proceeds to assert with some precaution that it was in the power of parliament to refuse the kings demand of a subsidy and that there was an instance of that liberty in henry the thirds time near four hundred years before sub sine   a parliament elizabeth foresaw that this house of commons like all the foregoing would be governed by the puritans and therefore to obviate their enterprises she renewed at the beginning of the session her usual injunction that they should not on any account presume to treat of matters ecclesiastical notwithstanding this strict inhibition the zeal of one damport moved him to present a bill to the commons for remedying the grievances and restraining the tyranny of the ecclesiastical commission which were certainly enormous but when mr secretary wolley reminded the house of her majestys commands no one durst second the motion the bill was not so much as read and the speaker returned it back to damport without taking the least notice of it dewe p     some members of the house notwithstanding the general submission were even committed to custody on account of this attempt strypes life of whitgist p  0 neal vol   p  00   the imperious conduct of elizabeth appeared still more clearly in another parliamentary transaction the right of purveyance was an ancient prerogative by which the officers of the crown could at pleasure take provisions for the household from all the neighboring counties and the use of carts and carriages and the price of these services was fixed and stated the payment of the money was often distant and uncertain and the rates were always much inferior to the market price so that purveyance besides the slavery of it was always regarded as a great burden and being arbitrary and casual was liable to great abuses we may fairly presume that the hungry courtiers of elizabeth supported by her unlimited power would be sure to render this prerogative very oppressive to the people and the commons had last session found it necessary to pass a bill for regulating these exactions but the bill was lost in the house of peers dewe p   the continuance of the abuses begot a new attempt for redress and the same bill was now revived and sent up again to the house of peers together with a bill for some new regulations in the court of exchequer soon after the commons received a message from the upper house desiring them to appoint a committee for a conference at this conference the peers informed them that the queen by a message delivered by lord burleigh had expressed her displeasure that the commons should presume to touch on her prerogative if there were any abuses she said either in imposing purveyance or in the practice of the court of exchequer her majesty was both able and willing to provide due reformation but would not permit the parliament to intermeddle in these matters ibid p    the commons alarmed at this intelligence appointed a new committee to attend the queen and endeavor to satisfy her of their humble and dutiful intentions elizabeth gave a gracious reception to the committee she expressed her great nestimable loving care toward her loving subjects which she said was greater than of her own self or even than any of them could have of themselves she told them that she had already given orders for an enquiry into the abuses attending purveyance but the dangers of the spanish invasion had retarded the progress of that design that she had as much skill will and power to rule her own household as any subjects whatsoever to govern theirs and needed as little the assistance of her neighbors that the exchequer was her chamber consequently more near to her than even her household and therefore the less proper for them to intermeddle with and that she would of herself with the advice of her council and the judges redress all grievances in these matters but would not permit them by laws moved without her privity to bereave her of the honor attending these regulations dewes p      the issue of this matter was the same that attended all contests between elizabeth and her parliaments si rixa est ubi tu pulsas ego vapulo tantum juven  she seems even to have been more imperious in this particular than her predecessors at least her more remote ones for they often permitted the abuses of purveyance we may judge of the extent and importance of these abuses by a speech of bacons against purveyors delivered in the first parliament of the subsequent reign first says he they take in hand what they ought not to take secondly they take in quantity a far greater proportion than comes to your majestys use thirdly they take in an unlawful manner in a manner i say directly and expressly prohibited by several laws for the first i am a little to alter their name for instead of takers they become taxers instead of taking provisions for your majestys service they tax your people ad redimendam vexationem imposing upon them and extorting from them diverse sums of money sometimes in gross sometimes in the nature of stipends annually paid ne noceant to be freed and eased of their oppression again they take trees which by law they cannot do timber trees which are the beauty countenance and shelter of mens houses that men have long spared from their own purse and profit that men esteem for their use and delight above ten times the value that area loss which men cannot repair or recover these do they take to the defacing and spoiling of your subjects mansions and dwellings except they may be compounded with to their own appetites and if a gentleman be too hard for them while he is at home they will watch their time when there is but a bailiss or a servant remaining and put the ax to the root of the tree ere ever the master can stop it again they use a strange and most unjust exaction in causing the subjects to pay poundage of their own debts due from your majesty unto them so as a poor man when he has had his hay or his wood or his poultry which perchance he was full loath to part with and had for the provision of his own family and not to put to sale taken from him and that not at a just price but under the value and comes to receive his money he shall have after the rate of twelve pence in the pound abated for poundage of his due payment upon so hard conditions nay farther they are grown to that extremity as is affirmed though it be scarce credible save that in such  all things are credible that they will take double poundage once when the debenture is made and again the second time when the money is paid for the second point most gracious soverign touching the quantity which they take sar above that which is answered to your majestys use  affirmed unto me by diverse gentlemen of good report as a matter which i may safely avouch unto your majesty that there is no pound profit which redoundeth unto your majesty in this course but induces and begets three pound damage upon your subjects beside the coffeehouse and to the end they may make their spoil more securely what do they whereas diverse statutes do strictly provide that whatsoever they take shall be registered and attested to the end that by making a collation of that which is taken from the country and that which is answered above their deceits might appear they to the end to obscure their deceits utterly omit the observation of this which the law prescribes and therefore to descend if it may please your majesty to the third sort of abuse which is of the unlawful manner of their taking whereof this question is a branch it is so manifold as it rather asks an enumeration of some of the particulars than a prosecution of all for their price by law they ought to take as they can agree with the subject by abuse they take at an imposed and enforced price by law they ought to make but one apprizement by neighbors in the country by abuse they make a second apprizement at the court gate and when the subjects cattle come up many miles lean and out of plight by reason of their travel then they prize them anew at an abated price by law they ought to take between sun and sun by abuse they take by twilight and in the nightime a time well chosen for malefactors by law they ought not to take in the highways a place by her majestys high prerogative protected and by statute by special words excepted by abuse they take in the highways by law they ought to show their commission etc a number of other particulars there are etc bacons works vol iv p  0   0   such were the abuses which elizabeth would neither permit her parliaments to meddle with nor redress herself i believe it will readily be allowed that this slight prerogative alone which ha passed almost unobserved amidst other branches of so much greater importance was sufficient to extinguish all regular liberty for what elector or member of parliament or even juryman dust oppose the will of the court while he lay under the lash of such an anbitrary prerogative for a farther account of the grievous and incredible oppressions of purveyors see the journals of the house of commons vol i p   0 there is a story of a carter which may be worth mentioning on this occasion a carter had three time been at windsor with his cart to carry away upon summons of a remove some part of the stuff of her majestys wardrobe and when he had repaired thither once twice and the third time and that they of the wardrobe had told him the third time that the remove held not the carter clapping his hand on his thigh said now life than the  as well as my wife which words being overheard by her majesty who then stood at the window she said what a viliain is this and so sent him three angels to stop his mouth irchs memoi vol i p       to be redressed by law see the statutes under this head of purveyance  edward the third allowed ten several statutes to be enacted for that purpose  in so great awe did the commons stand of every courtier as well as of the crown that they durst use no freedom of speech which they thought would give the least offense to any of them sir edward hobby showed in the house his great grief that by some great personage not a member of the house he had been sharply rebuked for speeches delivered in parliament he craved the favor of the house and desired that some of the members might inform that great personage of his true meaning and intention in these speeches dewes p          the commons to obviate these inconveniences passed a vote that no one should reveal the secrets of the house an act was passed this session enforcing the former statute which imposed twenty pounds a month on every one absent from public worship but the penalty was restricted to two thirds of the income of the recusant   eliz cap     the discomfiture of the armada had begot in the nation a kind of enthusiastic passion for enterprises against spain and nothing seemed now impossible to be achieved by the valor and fortune of the english don antonio prior of crato was a natural son of the royal family of portugal who trusting to the aversion of his countrymen against the castilians had advanced a claim to the crown and flying first to france thence to england had been encouraged both by henry and elizabeth in his pretensions expedition against portugal a design was formed by the people not the court of england to conquer the kingdom for don antonio sir francis drake and sir john norris were the leaders in this romantic enterprise near twenty thousand volunteers birchs memoirs of queen elizabeth vol l p    monson p     says that there were only fourteen thousand soldiers and four thousand seamen in the whole on this expedition but the account contained in dr birch is given by one of the most considerable of the adventurers inlisted themselves in the service and ships were hired as well as arms provided at the sole charge of the adventurers the queens frugality kept her from contributing more than sixty thousand pounds to the expense and she only allowed six of her ships of war to attend the expedition monson p      there was more spirit and bravery than foresight or prudence in the conduct of this enterprise the small stock of the adventurers would not permit them to buy either provisions or ammunition sufficient for such an undertaking they even wanted vessels to stow the numerous volunteers who crowded to them and they were obliged to seize by force some ships of the hanse towns which they met with at sea an expedient which set them somewhat more at their case in point of room for their men but remedied not the deficiency of their provisions ibid p      had they sailed directly to portugal it is believed that the good will of the people joined to the defenseless state of the kingdom might have ensured them of success but hearing that great preparations were making at the groine for the invasion of england they were induced to go thither and destroy this new armament of spain they broke into the harbor burned some ships of war particularly one commanded by recalde vice admiral of spain they defeated an army of four or five thousand men which was assembled to oppose them they assaulted the groine and took the lower town which they pillaged and they would have taken the higher though well fortified had they not found their ammunition and provisions beginning to fall short the young earl of essex a nobleman of very promising hopes who ired with the thirst of military honor had secretly unknown to the queen stole from england here joined the adventurers and it was then agreed by common consent to make ail for portugal the main object of their enterprise  the english landed at paniche a seaport town twelve leagues from lisbon and norris led the army to that capital while drake undertook to sail up the river and attack the city with his united forces by this time the court of spain had got leizure to prepare against the invasion of the english forces were thrown into lisbon the portuguese were disarmed all suspected persons were taken into custody and thus though the inhabitants bore great affection to don antonio none of them dared to declare in favor of the invaders the english army however made themselves masters of the suburbs which abounded with riches of all kinds but as they desired to conciliate the affections of the portugueze and were more intent on honor than profit they observed a strict discipline and abstained from all plunder meanwhile they found their ammunition and provisions totally exhausted they had not a single cannon to make a breach in the walls the admiral had not been able to pass some fortresses which guarded the river there was no appearance of any insurrection in their favor sickness from fatigue hunger and intemperance in wine and fruits had seized the army so that it was found requisite to make all haste possible to reimbark they were not pursued by the enemy and finding at the mouth of the river sixty ships laden with naval stores they seized them as lawful prize though they belonged to the hanse towns a neutral power they sailed thence to vigo which they took and burned and having ravaged the country round they set sail and arrived safely in england above the half of these gallant adventurers perished by sickness famine fatigue and the sword birchs memoit vol l p     and england reaped much more honor than profit from this extraordinary expedition it is computed that eleven hundred gentlemen embarked on board this fleet and that only three hundred and fifty survived these multiplied disasters birch ibid   when these ships were on their voyage homewards they met with the earl of cumberland who was outward bound with a fleet of seven sail all equipped at his own charge except one ship of war which the queen had lent him that nobleman supplied sir francis drake with some provisions a generosity which saved the lives of many of drakes men but which the others suffered severely for afterward cumberland sailed toward the tereras and took several prizes from the enemy but the richest valued at an hundred thousand pounds perished in her return with all her cargo near st michaels mount in cornwall many of these adventurers were killed in a rash attempt at the terceras a destructive mortality seized the rest and it was with difficulty that the few hands which remained were able to str the ships home into harbor monson p       scotch affairs though the signal advantages gained over the spaniards and the spirit which they infused into the english gave elizabeth great security during the rest of her reign she could not forbear keeping an anxious eye toward scotland whose situation rendered the revolutions of that kingdom always of importance to her it might have been expected that this highspirited princess who knew so well to encounter danger would not have retained that suspicious jealousy toward scotland with which during the lifetime of mary she had been so much agitated james had indeed succeeded to all his mothers claims but he had not succeeded to the favor of the catholics which could alone render these claims dangerous winwood vol i p     and as the queen was now well advanced in years and enjoyed the most uncontrouled authority over her subjects it was not likely that the king of scots who was of an indolent unambitious temper would ever give her any disturbance in the possession of her throne yet all these circumstances could not remove her timorous suspicions and so far from satisfying the nation by a settlement of the successi n or a declaration of jamess title she was as anxious to prevent every incident which might raise his credit or procure him the regard of the english as if he had been her immediate rival and competitor most of his ministers and favorites were her pensioners and as she was desirous to hinder him from marrying and having children she obliged them to throw obstacles in the way of every alliance even the most reasonable which could be offered him and during some years she succeeded in this malignant policy melvil p          he had fixed on the eldest daughter of the king of denmark who being a remote prince and not very powerful could give her no umbrage yet did she so artfully cross this negotiation that the danish monarch impatient of delay married his daughter to the duke of brunswic james then renewed his suit to the younger princess and still found obstacles from the intrigues of elizabeth who merely with a view of interposing delay proposed to him the sister of the king of navarre a princess much older than himself and entirely destitute of fortune the young king besides the desire of securing himself by offspring from those traitorous attempts too frequent among his subjects had been so watched by the rigid austerities of the ecclesiastics that he had another inducement to marriage which is not so usual with monarchs his impatience therefore broke through all the politics of elizabeth the articles of marriage were settled the ceremony was performed by proxy and the princess embarked for scotland but was drove by a storm into a port of norway this tempest and some others which happened near the same time were universally believed in scotland and denmark to have proceeded from a combination of the scottish and danish witches and the dying confession of the criminals was supposed to place the accusation beyond all controversy melvil p   0  james however though a great believer in sorcery was not deterred by this incident from taking a voyage in order to conduct his bride home he arrived in norway carried the queen thence to copenhagen and having passed the winter in that city he brought her next spring to scotland where they were joyfully received by the people the clergy alone who never let pass an opportunity of vexing him made opposition to the queens coronation on account of the ceremony of anointing her which they alleged was either a jewish or a popish rite and therefore utterly antichristian and unlawful but james was as much bent on the ceremony as they were averse to it and after much controversy and many intrigues his authority which had not often happened at last

discouraged by the great superiority of his enemies took the field and in the year      gained at coutras a complete victory over the army of the french king but as his allies the germans were at the same time discomfited by the army of the league under the duke of guise his situation notwithstanding his victory seemed still as desperate as ever the chief advantage which he reaped from this diversity of success was the divisions which by that means took place among his enemies the inhabitants of paris intoxicated with admiration of guise and strongly prejudiced against their king whose intentions had become suspicious to them took to arms and obliged henry to fly for his safety that prince dissembling his resentment entered into negotiation with the league and having conferred many high offices on guise and his partisans summoned an assembly of the states at blois under preten e of finding means and expedients to support the intended war against the hugonots the various scenes of persidy and cruelty which had been exhibited in france had justly begot a mutual diidence among all parties yet guise trusting more to the timidity than honor of the king rashly put himself into

embraced more violent counsels than were natural to him and ordered that duke and his brother the cardinal of guise to be assassinated in his palace  this cruel execution which the necessity of it could alone excuse had nearly proved fatal to the author and seemed at first to plunge him into greater dangers than those which he sought to avoid by taking vengeance on his enemy the partisans of the league were enflamed with the utmost rage against him the populace every where particularly at paris renounced all allegiance to him the ecclesiastics and the preachers filled all places with execrations against his name and the most powerful cities and the most opulent provinces appeared to combine in a resolution of renouncing monarchy or of changing their monarch henry finding slender resources among his catholic subjects was constrained to enter into a confederacy with the hugonots and the king of navarre he enlisted large bodies of swiss infantry and german cavalry and being still supported by his chief nobility he assembled by all these means an army of near forty thousand men and advanced to the gates of paris ready to crush the league and subdue all his enemies the desperate resolution of one man diverted the course of these great events jaques clement a dominican monk inflamed by that bloody spirit of bigotry which distinguishes this century and a great part of the following one beyond all other ages of the world embraced the resolution of sacrificing his own life in order to save the church from the persecutions of an heretical tyrant murder of henry the

their sovereign this remarkable incident happened on the first of august       the king of navarre next heir to the crown assumed the government under the title of henry the fourth but succeeded to much greater difficulties than those which surrounded his predecessor the prejudices entertained against his religion made a great part of the nobility desert him and it was only by his promise of hearkening to conferences and instruction that he could engage any of the catholics to adhere to his undoubted title the league governed by the duke of mayenne brother to guise gathered new force and the king of spain entertained views either of dismembering the monarchy or of annexing the whole to his own dominions in these distressful circumstances henry addressed himself to elizabeth and found her well disposed to contribute to his assistance and to oppose the progress of the catholic league and of the king of spain her inveterate and dangerous enemies to prevent the desertion of his swiss and german troops she made him a present of twentytwo thousand pounds a larger sum than as he declared he had ever seen before and she sent him a reinforcement of four thousand men under lord willoughby an officer of reputation who joined the french at dieppe strengthened by these supplies henry marched directly to paris and having taken the suburbs sword in hand he abandoned them to be pillaged by his soldiers he employed this body of english troops in many other enterprises and found still great cause to praise their courage and fidelity the time of their service being elapsed he dismissed them with many high commendations sir william drury sir thomas baskerville and sir john boroughs acquired reputation this campaign and revived in france the ancient fame of english valor  progress of henry the fourth the army which henry next campaign led into the field was much inferior to that of the league but as it was composed of the chief nobility of france he feared not to encounter his enemies in a pitched battle at yvr and he gained a complete victory over them this success enabled him to blockade paris and he reduced that capital to the last extremity of famine when the duke of parma in consequence of orders from philip marched to the relief of the league and obliged henry to raise the blockade having performed this important service he retired back to the low countries and by his consummate skill in the art of war performed these long marches in the face of the enemy without affording the french monarch that opportunity which he sought of giving him battle or so much as putting his army once in disorder the only loss which he sustained was in the low countries where prince maurice took advantage of his absence and recovered some towns which parma had formerly conquered from the states this year the nation suffered a great loss by the death of sir francis walsingham secretary o state a man equally celebrated for his ability and his integrity he had passed through many employment had been very frugal in his expenses yet died so poor that his family was obliged to give him a private burial he lt only one daughter first married to sir philip sidney

seat of their naval preparations and might more easily from that near neighborhood than from spain or portugal project an invasion of england she concluded therefore a new treaty with henry in which she engaged to send over three thousand men to be employed in the reduction of britanny and stipulated that her charges should in a twelve month or so soon as the enemy was expelled be refunded her camden p      these forces were commanded by sir john norris and under him by his brother henry and by anthony shirley sir roger williams was at the head of a small body which garrisoned dieppe and a squadron of ships under the command of sir henry palmer lay upon the coast of france and intercepted all the vessels belonging to the spaniards or the leaguers  the events of war can very little be regulated before hand by any treaty or agreement and henry who found it requisite to lay aside the projected enterprise against britanny persuaded the english commanders to join his army and to take a share in the war which he carried on in picardy rymer tom xiv p      notwithstanding the disgust which elizabeth received from this disappointment he laid before her a plan for expelling the leaguers from normandy and persuaded her to send over a new body of four thousand men to assist him in that enterprise the earl of essex was appointed general of these forces a young nobleman who by many exterior accomplishments and still more real merit was daily advancing in favor with elizabeth and seemed to occupy that place in her affections which leicester who was now deceased had so long enjoyed essex impatient for military fame was extremely uneasy to lie some time at dieppe unemployed and had not the orders which he received from his mistress been so positive he would gladly have accepted of henrys invitation and have marched to join the french army now in champagne this plan of operations was also proposed to elizabeth by the french ambassador but she rejected it with great displeasure and she threatened immediately to recall her troops if henry should persevere any longer in his present practice of breaking all concert with her and attending to nothing but his own interests birchs negociations  rymer tom xiv p       0  urged by these motives the french king at last led his army into normandy and laid siege to rouen which he reduced to great difficulties but the league who were unable of themselves to take the field against him had again recourse to the duke of parma who received orders to march to their assistance he executed this enterprise with his usual ability camden p      it is probable however that their own ardent courage and their desire of distinguishing themselves in so celebrated a theater for war were the cause why they so often enjoyed this perilous honor  notwithstanding the indifferent success of former enterprises the queen was sensible how necessary it was to support henry against the league and the spaniards and she formed a new treaty with him in which they agreed never to make peace with philip but by common consent she promised to send him a new supply of four thousand men and he stipulated to repay her charges in a twelvemonth to employ these forces joined to a body of french troops in an expedition against britanny and to consign into her hands a seaport town of that province for a retreat to the english rymer vol xvi p                  henry knew the impossibility of executing some of these articles and the imprudence of fulfilling others but finding them rigidly insisted on by elizabeth he accepted of her succors and trusted that he might easily under some pretense be able to excuse his failure in the execution of his part of the treaty this campaign was the least successful to henry of all those which he had yet carried on against the league  naval enterprises against spain during these military operations in france elizabeth employed her naval power against spain and endeavored to intercept the westindian treasures the source of that greatness which rendered philip so formidable to all his neighbors she sent a squadron of seven ships under the command of lord thomas howard for this service but the king of spain informed of her purpose fitted out a navy of fiftyfive sail and dispatched them to escort the indian fleet they fell in with the english squadron and by the courageous obstinacy of sir richard greenville the vice admiral who refused to make sail with the rest of the squadron they took one ship the first english man of war which had yet fallen into the hands of the spaniards this action of sir richard greenville is so singular as to merit a more particular relation he was engaged alone with the whole spanish fleet of fiftythree sail which had ten thousand men on board and from th time the fight begun which was about three in the afternoon to the break of day next morning he repulsed the enemy fifteen times though they continually shifted their vessels and boarded with fresh men in the beginning of the action he himself received a wound but he continued doing his duty above deck till eleven at night when receiving a fresh wound he was carried down to be dressed during this operation he received a shot in the head and the surgeon was killed by his side the english began now to want powder all their small arms were broke or become useless of their number which were but a hundred and three at first forty were killed and almost all the rest wounded their masts were beat overboard their tackle cut in pieces and nothing but a hulk left unable to move one way or other in this situation sir richard proposed to the ships company to trust to the mercy of god not to that of the spaniards and to destroy the ship with themselves ather than yield to the enemy the master gunner and many of the seamen agreed to this desperate resolution but others opposed it and obliged greenville to surrender himself prisoner he died a few days after and his last words were here die i richard greenville with a joyful and quiet mind for that i have ended my life as a true soldier ought to do fighting for his country queen religion and honor my soul willingly departing from this body leaving behind the lasting fame of having behaved as every valiant soldier is in duty bound to do the spaniards lost in this sharp though unequal action sour ships and about a thousand men and greenvilles vessel herself perished soon after with two hundred spaniards in her hackluyts voyages vol ii part   p     camden p      the rest of the squadron returned safely into england frustrated of their expectations but pleasing themselves with the idea that their attempt had not been altogether fruitless in hurting the enemy the indian fleet had been so long detained in the havanna from the fear of the english that they were obliged at last to set sail in an improper season and most of them perished by shipwreck ere they reached the spanish harbors monson p      the earl of cumberland made a like unsuccessful enterprise against the spanish trade he carried out one ship of the queens and seven others equipped at his own expense but the prizes which he made did not compensate him for the charge ibid p       the spirit of these expensive and hazardous adventures was very prevalent in england sir walter raleigh who had enjoyed great favor with the queen finding his interest to decline resolved to recover her good graces by some important undertaking and as his reputation was high in england he persuaded great numbers to engage with him as volunteers in an attempt on the west indies the fleet was detained so long in the channel by contrary winds that the season was lost raleigh was recalled by the queen sir martin forbisher succeeded to the command and made a privateering voyage against the spaniards he took a rich carrack near the island of flores and destroyed another ibid p     camden p      about the same time thomas white a londoner took two spanish ships which besides fourteen hundred chests of quicksilver contained above two millions of bulls for indulgences a commodity useless to the english but which had cost the king of spain three hundred thousand florins and would have been sold by him in the indies for five millions  strype vol iii  a charge which notwithstanding her extreme frugality was too burdensome for her narrow revenues to bear    february a parliament she summoned therefore a parliament in order to obtain supply but she either thought her authority so established that she needed to make them no concessions in return or she rated her power and prerogative above money for there was never any parliament whom she treated in so haughty a manner whom she made more sensible of their own weakness or whose privileges she more undervalued when the speaker sir edward coke made the three usual demands of freedom from arrests of access to her person and of liberty of speech she replied to him by the mouth of puckering lord keeper that liberty of speech was granted the commons but they must know what liberty they were entitled to not a liberty for every one to speak what he lists or what comes in his brain to utter their privilege extended no farther than a liberty of aye or no that she enjoined the speaker if he perceived any idle heads so negligent of their own safety as to attempt reforming the church or innovating in the commonwealth that he should refuse any bills exhibited to that purpose till they were examined by such as were fitter to consider of these things and could better judge of them that she would not impeach the freedom of their persons but they must beware lest under color of this privilege they imagined that any neglect of their duty could be covered or protected and that she would not refuse them access to her person provided it was upon urgent and weighty causes and at times convenient and when she might have leisure from other important causes of the realm dewes p   0     townsend p      notwithstanding the menacing and contemptuous air of this speech the intrepid and indefatigable peter wentworth not discouraged by his former ill success ventured to transgress the imperial orders of elizabeth he presented to the lord keeper a petition in which he desired the upper house to join the lower in a supplication to her majesty for entailing the succession of the crown and declared that he had a bill ready prepared for that purpose this method of proceeding was sufficiently respectful and cautious but the subject was always extremely disagreeable to the queen and what she had expressly prohibited any one to meddle with she sent wentworth immediately to the tower committed sir thomas bromley who had seconded him to the fleet prison together with stevens and welsh two members to whom sir thomas had communicated his intention dewes p   0 townsend p   about a fortnight after a motion was made in the house to petition the queen for the release of these members but it was answered by all the privy counselors there present that her majesty had committed them for causes best known to herself and that to press her on that head would only tend to the prejudice of the gentlemen whom they meant to serve she would release them whenever she thought proper and would be better pleased to do it of her own proper motion than from their suggestion dewes p      the house willingly acquiesced in this reasoning  so arbitrary an act at the commencement of the session might well repress all farther attempts for freedom but the religious zeal of the puritans was not so easily restrained and it inspired a courage which no human motive was able to surmount morris attorney of the court of wards made a motion for redressing the abuses in the bishops courts but above all in the high commission where subscriptions he said were exacted to articles at the pleasure of the prelates where oaths were imposed obliging persons to answer to all questions without distinction even though they should tend to their own condemnation and where every one who refused entire satisfaction to the commissioners was imprisoned without relief or remedy  p     townsend p  0  this motion was seconded by some members but the ministers and privy counselors opposed it and foretold the consequences which ensued the queen sent for the speaker and after requiring him to deliver morrices bill to her she told him that it was in her power to call parliaments in her power to dissolve them in her power to give assent or dissent to any determination which they should form that her purpose in summoning thy parliament was twofold to have laws enacted for the farther enforcement of uniformity in religion and to provide for the defense of the nation against the exorbitant power of spain that these two points ought therefore to be the object of their deliberation she had enjoin d them already by the mouth of the lord keeper to meddle neither with matters of state nor of religion and she wondered how any one could be so assuming as to attempt a subject so expressly contrary to her prohibition that she was highly offended with this presumption and took the present opportunity to reiterate the commands given by the keeper and to require that to bill regarding other state  or reformation in causes ecclesiastical be exhibited in the house and that in particular she charged the speaker upon his allegiance that if any such bills were offered ab olutely to refuse them a r aing and not so much as per them to be debated by the members dewes p         townsend p     this command from the queen was submitted to without farther question morris was seized in the house by a sergeant at arms discharged from his office of chancellor of the duchy disabled from any practice

should and should not do the commons were as obsequious to the one as to the other of her injunctions they passed a very severe law against recusants such a law as was suited to the persecuting spirit of elizabeth and of that age it was entitled an act to retain her majestys subjects in their due obedience and was meant as the preamble declares to obviate such inconveniences and perils as might grow from the wicked practices of seditious sectaries and disloyal persons for these two species of criminals were always at that time confounded together as equally dangerous to the peace of society it was enacted that any person above sixteen years of age who obstinately refused during the space of a month to attend the public worship should be committed to prison that if after being condemned for this offense he persist three months in his refusal he must abjure the realm and that if he either refuse this condition or return after banishment he is to suffer capitally as a felon without benefit of clergy    eliz c    this law bore equally hard upon the puritans as upon the catholics and had it not been imposed by the queens authority was probably in that respect very much contrary to the private sentiments and inclinations of the majority in the house of commons very little opposition however appears there to have been openly made to it after enacting this statute the clergy in order to remove the odium from themselves often took care that recusants should be tried by the civil judges at the assizes rather than by the ecclesiastical commissioners strypes ann vol iv p      the expenses of the war with spain having reduced the queen to great necessity of a supply the grant of subsidies seems to have been the most important business of this parliament and it was a singular mark of the high spirit of elibeth that while conscious of a present dependence on the commons she opened the session with the most haughty treatment of them and covered her weakness under such a lofty appearance of superiority the commons readily voted two subsidies and four fifteenths but this sum not appearing sufficient to the court a very unusual expedient was fallen upon to induce them to make an enlargement in their concession the peers informed the commons in a conference that they could not give their assent to the supply voted thinking it too small for the queens occasions they therefore proposed a grant of three subsidies and six fifteenths and desired a conference in order to persuade the commons to agree to this measure the commons who had acquired the privilege of beginning all bills of subsidy took offense at this procedure of the lords and at first absolutely rejected the conference but being afraid on reflection that they had by this refusal given offense to their superiors they both agreed to the conference and afterward voted the additional subsidy dewes p           townsend p      the queen notwithstanding this unusual concession of the commons ended the session with a speech containing some reprimands to them and full of the same high pretensions which she had assumed at the opening of the parliament she took notice by the mouth of the keeper that some members spent more time than was requisite by indulging themselves in harangues and reasonings and she expressed her displeasure on account of their not paying the due reverence to privy counselors who she told them were not to be accounted as common knights and burgesses of the house who are counselors but during the parliament whereas the others are standing counselors and for their wisdom and great service are called to the council of the state ddwes p  townsend p   the queen also in her own person made the parliament a spirited harangue in which she spoke of the justice and moderation of her government expressed the small ambition she had ever entertained of making conquests displayed the just grounds of her quarrel with the king of spain and discovered how little she apprehended the power of that monarch even though he should make a greater effort than that of his invincible armada but i am informed added she that when he attempted this last invasion some upon the seacoasts forsook their towns sled up higher into the country and left all naked and exposed to his entrance but i swear unto you by god if i knew those persons or may know of any that shall do so hereafter i will make them feel what it is to be so fearful in so urgent a cause d ewes p     townsend p    by this menace she probably gave the people to understand that she would exercise martial law upon such cowards for there was no statute by which a man could be punished for changing his habitation  the king of france though he had hitherto made war on the league with great bravery and reputation though he had this campaign gained considerable advantages over them and though he was assisted by a considerable body of english under norris who carried hostilities into the heart of britanny was become sensible that he never could by force of arms alone render himself master of his kingdom the nearer his military successes seemed to approach him to a full possession of the throne the more discontent and jealousy arose among those romanists who adhered to him and a party was formed in his own court to elect some catholic monarch of the royal blood if he refused any longer to satisfy them by declaring his conversion this excellent prince was far from being a bigot to his sect and as he esteemed these theological disputes to be entirely subordinate to the public good he had tacitly determined from the beginning to come some time or other to the resolution required of him he had found on the death of his predecessor that the hugonots who formed the bravest and most faithful part of his army were such determined zealots that if he had at that time abjured their faith they would instantly have abandoned him to the pretensions and usurpations of the catholics the more bigoted catholics he knew particularly those of the league had entertained such an unsurmountable prejudice against his person and diffidence of his sincerity that even his conversion would not reconcile them to his title and he must either expect to be entirely excluded the throne or to be admitted to it on such terms as would leave him little more than the mere shadow of royalty in this delicate situation he had resolved to temporize to retain the hugonots by continuing the profession of their religion to gain the moderate catholics by giving them hopes of his conversion to attach both to his person by conduct and success and he hoped either that the animosity of war against the league would make them drop gradually the question of religion or that he might in time after some victories over his enemies and some conferences with divines make finally with more decency and dignity that abjuration which must have appeared at first both mean and suspicious to both parties  henry iv embraces the catholic religion when the people are attached to any theological tenets merely from a general persuasion or prepossession they are easily induced by any motive or authority to change their faith in these mysterious subjects as appears from the example of the english who during some reigns generally embraced without scruple the still varying religion of their sovereigns but a nation like the french where principles had so long been displayed as the badges of faction and where each party had fortified its belief by an animosity against the other were not found so pliable or inconstant and henry was at last convinced that the catholics of his party would entirely abandon him if he gave them not immediate satisfaction in this particular the hugonots also taught by experience clearly saw that his desertion of them was become entirely necessary for the public settlement and so general was this persuasion among them that the duke of sully pretends even the divines of that party purposely allowed themselves to be overcome in the disputes and conferences that the king might more readily be convinced of the weakness of their cause and might more cordially and sincerely at least more decently embrace the religion which it was so much his interest to believe if this selfdenial in so tender a point should appear incredible and supernatural in theologians it will at least be thought very natural that a prince so little instructed in these points as henry and so desirous to preserve his sincerity should insensibly bend his opinion to the necessity of his affairs and should believe that party to have the best arguments who could alone put him in possession of a kingdom all circumstances therefore being prepared for this great event that monarch renounced the protestant religion and was solemnly received by the french prelates of his party into the bosom of the church  elizabeth who was herself chiefly attached to the protestants by her interests and the circumstances of her birth and who seems to have entertained some propensity during her whole life to the catholic superstition at least to the ancient ceremonies yet pretended to be extremely displeased with this abjuration of henry and she wrote him a very angry letter reproaching him with this interested change of his religion sensible however that the league and the king of spain were still their common enemies she hearkened to his apologies continued her succors both of men and money and formed a new league in which they mutually stipulated never to make peace but by common agreement  scotch affairs the intrigues of spain were not limited to france and england the never failing pretense of religion joined to the influence of money excited new disorders in scotland and gave fresh alarms to elizabeth george ker brother to the lord newbottle had been taken while he was making his passage secretly into spain and some papers were found about him by which a dangerous conspiracy of some catholic noblemen with philip was discovered the earls of angus errol and huntley the heads of three potent families had entered into a confederacy with the spanish monarch and had stipulated to raise all their forces to join with thirty thousand spanish troops which philip engaged to send into scotland and after reestablishing the catholic religion in that kingdom to march with their united power in order to effectuate the same purpose in england spotswood p     rymer tom xvi p     graham of fintry who had also entered into this conspiracy was taken and arraigned and executed elizabeth sent lord borough ambassador into scotland and exhorted the king to exercise the same severity on the three earls to forfeit their estates and by annexing them to the crown both increase his own demesns and set an example to all his subjects of the dangers attending treason and rebellion this advice was certainly very rational but not easy to be executed by the small revenue and limited authority of james he desired therefore some supply from her of men and money but though she had reason to esteem the prosecution of the three popish earls a common cause he never could obtain the least assistance from her the tenth part of the expense which she bestowed in supporting the french king and the states would have sufficed to execute this purpose more immediately essential to her security spotswood p    rymer tom xvi p      but she seems ever to have borne some degree of malignity to james whom she hated both as her heir and as the son of mary her hated rival and competitor so far from giving him assistance to prosecute the catholic conspirators she rather contributed to his inquietude by countenancing the turbulent disposition of the earl of bothwel ibid p          a nobleman descended from a natural son of james the fifth bothwel more than once attempted to render himself master of the kings person and being expelled the kingdom for these traitorous designs he took shelter in england was secretly protected by the queen and lurked near the borders where his power lay with a view of still enterprizing some new violence he succeeded at last in an attempt on the king and by the mediation of the english ambassador imposed very dishonorable terms upon that prince but james with the authority of the convention of states annulled this agreement as imposed by violence again expelled bothwel the country and obliged him to take shelter in england elizabeth pretending ignorance of the place of his retreat never executed the treaties by which she was obliged to deliver up all rebels and fugitives to the king of scotland during these disorders increased by the refractory disposition of the ecclesiastics the prosecution of the catholic earls remained in suspense  the established authority of the queen secured her from all such attempts as james was exposed to from the mutinous disposition of his subjects and her enemies found no other means of giving her any domestic disturbance than by such traitorous and perfidious machinations as ended in their own disgrace and in the ruin of their criminal instruments roderigo lopez a jew domestic physician to the queen being imprisoned on suspicion confessed that he had received a bribe to poison her from fuentes and ibarra who had succeeded parma lately deceased in the government of the netherlands but he maintained that he had no other intention than to cheat philip of his money and never meant to fulfill his promise he was however executed for the conspiracy and the queen complained to philip of these dishonorable attempts of his ministers but could obtain no satisfaction camden p     birchs negot p    bacon vol iv p      york and williams two english traitors were afterward executed for a like conspiracy with ibarra camden p      instead of revenging herself by retaliating in this shameful manner elizabeth sought a more honorable vengeance by supporting the king of france and assisting him in finally breaking the force of the league which after the conversion of that monarch went daily to decay and was threatened with speedy ruin and dissolution norris commanded the english forces in britanny and assisted at the taking of morlaix quimpercorentin and breast towns guarded by spanish forces in that province in every action the english though they had so long enjoyed domestic peace discovered a strong military disposition and the queen though herself a heroine found more frequent occasion to reprove her generals for encouraging their temerity than for countenancing their fear or caution ibid p     sir martin forbisher her brave admiral perished with many others before breast morlaix had been promised the english for a place of retreat but the duke daumont the french general eluded this promise by making it be inserted in the capitulation that none but catholics should be admitted into that city  she began to be more sparing in his cause of the blood and treasure of her subjects  some disgusts which she had received from the states joined to the remonstrances of her frugal minister burleigh made her also inclined to diminish her charges on that side and she even demanded by her ambassador sir thomas bodley to be reimbursed of all the money which she had expended in supporting them the states besides alleging the conditions of the former treaty by which they were not obliged to repay her till the conclusion of a peace pleaded their present poverty and distress the great superiority of the spaniards and the difficulty of supporting the war much more of saving money to discharge their encumbrances after much negotiation a new treaty was at last formed by which the states were bound to free the queen immediately from the charge of the english auxiliaries computed at forty thousand pounds a year to pay her annually twenty thousand pounds for some years to assist her with a certain number of ships and to conclude no peace nor treaty without her consent they also bound themselves on the conclusion of the peace with spain to pay her annually the sum of an hundred thousand pounds for four years but on this condition that the payment should be in lieu of all debts and that they should be supplied at their own charges with a body of four thousand auxiliaries from england camden p         undertaken against the common enemy in the great battle of turnhoult gained this campaign by prince maurice the english auxiliaries under sir francis vere and sir robert sidney had extremely distinguished themselves and the fortunate success of that day was universally ascribed to their discipline and valor  naval enterprises though elizabeth at a great expense of blood and treasure made war against philip in france and the low countries the most severe blows which she gave the spanish greatness were owing to those naval enterprises which either she or her subjects scarce ever intermitted during one season in      richard hawkins son to sir john the famous navigator procured the queens commission and sailed with three ships to the south sea by the straits of magellan but his voyage proved unfortunate and he himself was taken prisoner on the coast of chili james lancaster was fitted out the same year with three ships and a pinnace by the merchants of london and was more fortunate in his adventures he took thirtynine ships of the enemy and not contented with this success he made an attempt on fernambouc in brazil where he knew great treasures were at that time lodged as he approached the land he saw it lined with great numbers of the enemy but nowise daunted with this appearance he placed the stoutest of his men in boats and ordered them to row with such violence against the shore as to split them in pieces by this bold action he both deprived his men of all hopes of returning but by victory and terrified the enemy who fled after a short resistance he returned home safely with the treasure which he had so bravely acquired in      sir walter raleigh who had anew forfeited the queens friendship by an intrigue with one of the maids of honor and who had been confined in prison for this misdemeanor no sooner recovered his liberty than he was pushed by his active and enterprizing genius to attempt some great action the success of the first spanish adventurers against mexico and peru had begot an extreme avidity in europe and a prepossession universally took place that in the inland parts of south america called guiana a country as yet undiscovered there were mines and treasures and riches far beyond any thing which cortes or pizarro had yet met with raleigh whose turn of mind was somewhat romantic and extravagant undertook at his own charge the discovery of this wonderful country having taken the small tower of st joseph in the isle of trinidado where he found no riches he left his ship and sailed up the river oroonoko in pinnaces but without meeting with any thing to answer his expectations on his return he published an account of this country full of the greatest and most palpable lies that were ever attempted to be imposed on the credulity of mankind camden p       monson p       the bad success of this enterprise in the indies made the english rather attempt the spanish dominions in europe where they heard philip was making great preparations for a new invasion of england a powerful fleet was equipped at plymouth consisting of an hundred and seventy vessels seventeen of which were capital ships of war the rest tenders and small vessels twenty ships were added by the hollanders in this fleet there were computed to be six thousand three hundred and sixty soldiers a thousand volunteers and six thousand seven hundred and seventytwo seamen beside the dutch the land forces were commanded by the earl of essex the navy by lord effingham high admiral both these commanders had expended great sums of their own in this armament for such was the spirit of elizabeths reign the lord thomas howard sir camden p       the fleet set sail on the first of june      and meeting with a fair wind bent their course to cadiz at which place by sealed orders delivered to all the captains the general rendesvous was appointed they sent before them some armed tenders which intercepted every ship that could carry intelligence to the enemy and they themselves were so fortunate when they came near cadiz as to take an irish vessel by which they learned that that port was full of merchant ships of great value and that the spaniards lived in perfect security without any apprehensions of an enemy this intelligence much encouraged the english fleet and gave them the prospect of a fortunate issue to the enterprise  after a fruitless attempt to land at st sebastians on the western side of the island of cadiz it was upon deliberation resolved by the council of war to attack the ships and galleys in the bay this attempt was esteemed very rash and the lord admiral himself who was cautious in his temper had entertained great scruples with regard to it but essex strenuously urged the enterprise and when he found the resolution at last taken he threw his hat into the sea and gave sympoms of the most extravagant joy he felt however a great mortification when effingham informed him that the queen who was anxious for his safety and who dreaded the effects of his youthful ardour had secretly given orders that he should not be permitted to command the van in the attack monson p      that duty was performed by sir walter raleigh and the lord thomas howard but essex no sooner came within reach of the enemy than he forgot the promise which the admiral had exacted of him to keep in the midst of the fleet he broke through and pressed forward into the thickest of the fire emulation for glory avidity of plunder animosity against the spaniards proved incentives to every one and the enemy were soon obliged to loose anchor and retreat farther into the bay where they ran many of their ships aground essex then landed his men at the fort of puntal and immediately marched to the attack of cadiz which the impetuous valor of the english soon carried sword in hand the generosity of essex which was not inferior to his valor made him soon stop the slaughter and treat his prisoners with the greatest humani y and even assability and kindness the english made a rich plunder in the  but missed of a much richer by the resolution which the duke of mina the spanish admiral took of setting fire to the ships in order to prevent their  into the hands of the enemy it was computed that the loss which the spaniards suffered in this enterprise amounted to twenty millions of ducats birchs memoirs vol ii p     besides the indignity which that proud and ambitious people received from the taking one of their chief cities and destroying in their harbor a fleet of such force and value  essex all on fire for glory regarded this great success only as a step to future achievements he insisted on the keeping possession of cadiz and he undertook with four hundred men and three months provisions to defend the place till succors should arrive from england but all the other seamen and soldiers were satisfied with the glory which they had acquired and were impatient to return home in order to secure their plunder every other proposal of essex to annoy the enemy met with a like reception his scheme for intercepting the carracks at the azores for assaulting the groyne for taking st andero and st sebastian and the english finding so great difficulty to drag this impatient warrior from the enemy at last left him on the spanish coast attended with very few ships he complained much to the queen of their want of spirit in this enterprise nor was she satisfied that they had returned without attempting to intercept the indian fleet ibid p      but the great success in the enterprise on cadiz had covered all their miscarriages and that princess though she admired the lofty genius of essex could not forbear expressing an esteem for the other officers camden p      the admiral was created earl of nottingham and this promotion gave great disgust to essex sydney papers vol ii p     in the preamble of the patent it was said that the new dignity was conferred on him on account of his good services in taking cadiz and destroying the spanish ships a merit which essex pretended to belong solely to himself and he offered to maintain this plea by single combat against the earl of nottingham or his sons or any of his kindred  the achievements in the subsequent year proved not so fortunate but as the indian fleet very narrowly escaped the english philip had still reason to see the great hazard and disadvantage of that war in which he was engaged and the superiority which the english by their naval power and their situation had acquired over him the queen having received intelligence that the spaniards though their fleets were so much shattered and destroyed by the expedition at cadiz were preparing a squadron at ferrol and the groyne and were marching troops thither with a view of making an invasion on ireland was resolved to prevent their enterprise and to destroy the shipping in these harbors she prepared a large fleet of a hundred and twenty sail of which seventeen were her own ships fortythree were smaller vessels and the rest tenders and victuallers she embarked on board this fleet five thousand newlevied soldiers and added a thousand veteran troops whom sir francis vere brought from the netherlands the earl of essex commander in chief both of the land and sea forces was at the head of one squadron lord thomas howard was appointed vice admiral of another sir walter raleigh of the third lord mountjoy commanded the land forces under essex vere was appointed marshal sir george carew lieutenant of the ordnance and sir christopher blount first colonel the earls of rutland and southampton the lords gray cromwell and rich with several other persons of distinction attended as volunteers essex declared his resolution either to destroy this new armada which threatened england or to perish in the attempt   th july this powerful fleet set sail from plymouth but were no sooner out of the harbor than they met with a furious storm which shattered and dispersed them and before they could be refitted essex found that their provisions were so far spent that it would not be safe to carry so numerous an army along with him he dismissed therefore all the soldiers except the thousand veterans under vere and laying aside all thoughts of attacking ferrol or the groyne he confined the object of his expedition to the intercepting the indian fleet which had at first been considered only as the second enterprise which he was to attempt  the indian fleet at that time by reason of the imperfection of navigation had a stated course as well as season both in their going out and in their return and there were certain islands at which as at fixed stages they always touched and where they took in water and provisions the azores being one of these places where about this time the fleet was expected essex bent his course thither and he informed raleigh that he on his arrival intended to attack fayal one of these islands by some accident the squadrons were separated and raleigh arriving first before fayal thought it more prudent after waiting some time for the general to begin the attack alone lest the inhabitants should by farther delay have leizure to make greater preparations for their desence he succeeded in the enterprise but essex jealous of raleigh expressed great displeasure at this conduct and construed it as an intention of robbing the general of the glory which attended that action he cashiered therefore sydney bret berry and others who had concuried in the attempt and would have proceeded to the same extremity against raleigh himself had not lord thomas howard interposed with his good offices and persuaded raleigh though very highspirited to make submissions to the general essex who was placable as well as hasty and passionate was soon appeased and both received raleigh into favor and restored the other officers to their command monson p      this incident however though the quarrel was seemingly accommodated laid the first foundation of that violent animosity which afterward took place between these two gallant commanders  essex made next a disposition proper for intercepting the indian galleons and sir william monson whose station was the most remote of the fleet having fallen in with them made the signals which had been agreed on that able officer here ascribes essexs failure of success when he was so near attaining so mighty an advantage to his want of experience in seamanship and the account which he gives of the errors committed by that nobleman appears very reasonable as well as candid ibid p      the spanish fleet finding that their enemy was upon them made all the sail possible to the terceras and got into the safe and well fortified harbor of angra before the english fleet could overtake them essex intercepted only three ships which however were so rich as to pay all the charges of the expedition  the causes of this miscarriage of essexs enterprise were much canvassed in england upon the return of the fleet and though the courtiers took party differently as they affected either essex or raleigh the people in general who bore an extreme affection to the gallantry spirit and generosity of the former were inclined to justify every circumstance of his conduct the queen who loved the one as much as she esteemed the other maintained a kind of neutrality and endeavored to share her favors with an impartial hand between the parties sir robert cecil second son to lord burleigh was a courtier of very promising hopes much connected with raleigh and she made him secretary of state instead of sir thomas bodley whom essex recommended for that office but not to disgust essex by this preference she promoted him to the dignity of earl marshal of england an office which had been vacant ever since the death of the earl of shrewsbury essex might perceive from this conduct that she never intended to give him the entire ascendant over his rivals and might learn thence the necessity of moderation and caution but his temper was too high for submission his behavior too open and candid to practice the arts of a court and his free sallies while they rendered him only more amiable in the eyes of good judges gave his enemies many advantages against him    th october the war with spain though successful having exhausted the queens treasure she was obliged to assemble a parliament where yelverton a lawyer was chosen speaker by the house of commons it is usual for the speaker to disqualify himself for the office but the reasons employed by this speaker are so singular

haughtiest stomach even of their greatest subjects dewes p      elizabeth took care by the mouth of sir thomas egerton lord keeper to inform this assembly of the necessity of a supply she said that the wars formerly waged in europe had commonly been conducted by the parties without farther view than to gain a few towns or at most a province from each other but the object of the present hostilities on the part of spain was no other than utterly to bereave england of her religion her liberty and her independance that these blessings however she had hitherto been enabled to preserve in spite of the devil the pope and the spanish tyrant and all the mischievous designs of all her enemies that in this contest she had disbursed a sum treble to all the parliamentary supplies granted her and besides expending her ordinary revenues had been obliged to sell many of the crown lands and that she could not doubt but her subjects in a cause where their own honor and interest were so deeply concerned would willingly contribute to such moderate taxations as would be found requisite for their common defense dewes p         townsend p     the commons granted her three subsidies and six fifteenths the same supply which had been given four years before but which had then appeared so unusual that they had voted it should never afterward be regarded as a precedent  the commons this session ventured to engage in two controversies about forms with the house of peers a prelude to those encroachments which as they assumed more courage they afterward made upon the prerogatives of the crown they complained that the lords failed in civility to them by receiving their messages sitting with their hats on and that the keeper returned an answer in the same negligent posture but the upper house proved to their full satisfaction that they were not entitled by custom and the usage of parliament to any more respect dewes p       0   0     townsend p           some amendments had been made by the lords on a bill sent up by the commons and these amendments were wrote on parchment and returned with the bill to the commons the lower house took umbrage at the novelty they pretended that these amendments ought to have been wrote on paper not on parchment and they complained of this innovation to the peers the peers replied that they expected not such a frivolous objection from the gravity of the house and that it was not material whether the amendments were wrote on parchment or on paper nor whether the paper was white black or brown the commons were offended with this reply which seemed to contain a mocquery of them and they complained of it though without obtaining any satisfaction dewes p           an application was made by way of petition to the queen from the lower house against monopolies an abuse which had risen to an enormous height and they received a gracious though a general answer for which they returned their thankful acknowlegements ibid p   0      but not to give them too great encouragement in such applications she told them in the speech which she delivered at their dissolution that with regard to these patents she hoped that her dutiful and loving subjects would not take away her prerogative which is the chief flower in her garden and the principal and head pearl in her crown and diadem but that they would rather leave these matters to her disposal ibid p      the commons also took notice this session of some transactions in the court of high commission but not till they had previously received permission from her majesty to that purpose ibid p           had been amidst war and danger and he had passed the whole course of his life either in arms or in military preparations that after the proofs which he had given of his alacrity in the field no one could doubt but he would willingly for his part have continued in a course of life to which he was now habituated till the common enemy was reduced to such a condition as no longer to give umbrage either to him or to his allies that no private interest of his own not even that of his people nothing but the most inevitable necessity could ever induce him to think of a separate peace with philip or make him embrace measures which were not entirely formed with the approbation of all his confederates that his kingdom torn with the convulsions and civil wars of near half a century required some interval of repose ere it could reach a condition in which it might sustain itself much more support its allies that after the minds of his subjects were composed to tranquillity and accustomed to obedience after his finances were brought into order and after agriculture and the arts were restored france instead of being a burden as at present to her confederates would be able to lend them effectual succors and amply to repay them all the assistance which she had received during her calamities and that if the ambition of spain would not at present grant them such terms as they should think reasonable he hoped that in a little time he should attain such a situation as would enable him to mediate more effectually and with more decisive authority in their behalf  the ambassadors were sensible that these reasons were not feigned and they therefore remonstrated with the less vehemence against the measures which they saw henry was determined to pursue the states knew that that monarch was interested never to permit their final ruin and having received private assurances that he would still notwithstanding the peace give them assistance both of men and money they were well pleased to remain on terms of amity with him his greatest concern was to give satisfaction to elizabeth for this breach of treaty he had a cordial esteem for that princess a sympathy of manners and a gratitude for the extradinary favors which he had received from her during his greatest difficulties and he used every expedient to apologize and atone for that measure which necessity extorted from him peace of vervins but as spain refused to treat with the dutch as a free state and elizabeth would not negociate without her ally henry found himself obliged to conclude at vervins a separate peace by which he recovered possession of all the places seized by spain during the course of the civil wars and procured himself leizure to attend to the domestic settlement of his kingdom his capacity for the arts of peace were not inferior to his military talents and in a little time by his frugality order and wise government he raised france from the desolation and misery in which she was at present involved to a more flourishing condition than she had ever before enjoyed  the queen knew that it would be also in her power whenever she pleased to conclude the war on equitable terms and that philip having no pretensions upon her would be glad to free himself from an enemy who had foiled him in every contest and who had it still so much in her power to make him feel the weight of her arms some of her wisest counselors particularly the lord treasurer advised her to embrace pacific measures and set before her the advantages of tranquillity security and frugality as more considerable than any success which could attend the greatest victories but that highspirited princess though she was at first averse to the war seemed now to have attained such an ascendant over the enemy that she was unwilling to stop the course of her prosperous fortune she considered that her situation and her past victories had given her entire security against any dangerous invasion and the war must henceforth be conducted by sudden enterprises and naval expeditions in which she possessed an undoubted superiority that the weak condition of philip in the indies opened to her the view of the most desirable advantages and the yearly return of his treasure by sea afforded a continual prospect of important though more temporary successes that after his peace with france if she also should consent to an accommodation he would be able to turn all his force against the revolted provinces of the netherlands which though they had surprizingly increased their power by commerce and good government were still unable if not supported by their confederates to maintain the war against so mighty a monarchy and that as her defense of that commonwealth was the original ground of the quarrel it was unsafe as well as dishonorable to abandon their cause till she had placed them in a state of greater security  these reasons were frequently inculcated on her by the earl of essex whose passion for glory as well as his military talents made him earnestly desire the continuance of that war from which he expected to reap so much advantage and distinction the rivalship between this nobleman and lord burleigh made each of them insist the more strenuously on his own councils the earl of  and as essexs person was agreeable to the queen as well as his advice conformable to her inclinations the favorite seemed daily to acquire an ascendant over the minister had he been endowed with caution and selfcommand equal to his shining qualities he would have so riveted himself in the queens considence that none of his enemies had ever been able to impeach his credit but his lofty spirit could ill submit to that implicit deference which her temper required and which she had ever been accustomed to receive from all her subjects being once engaged in a dispute with her about the choice of a governor for ireland he was so heated in the argument that he entirely forgot the rules both of duty and civility and turned his back upon her in a contemptuous manner her anger which was naturally prompt and violent rose at this provocation and she instantly gave him a box in the ear adding a passionate expression suited to his impertinence instead of recollecting himself and making the submissions due to her sex and station he clapped his hand on his sword and swore he would not bear such usage were it from henry the eighth himself and in a great passion he immediately withdrew from court egerton the chancellor who loved essex exhorted him to repair his indiscretion by proper acknowlegements and entreated him not to give that triumph to his enemies that affliction to his friends as must ensue by his supporting a contest with his sovereign and deserting the service of his country but essex was deeply stung with the dishonor which he had received and seemed to think that an insult which might be pardoned a woman was become a mortal affront when it came from his sovereign if the vilest of all indignities said he is done me does religion enforce me to sue for pardon does god require it is it impiety not to do it why cannot princes err cannot subjects receive wrong is an earthly power infinite pardon me my lord i can never subscribe to these principles let solomons fool laugh when he is stricken let those that mean to make their profit of princes show no sense of princes injuries let them acknowledge an infinite absoluteness on earth that do not believe an absolute infiniteness in heaven alluding probably to the character and conduct of sr walter raleigh who lay under the general reproach of impiety as for me continued he i have received wrong i feel it my cause is good i know it and whatsoever happens all the powers on earth can never exert more strength and constancy in oppressing than i can show in suffering every thing that can or shall be imposed upon me your lordship in the beginning of your letter makes me a player and yourself a looker on and me a player of my own game so you may see more than i but give me leave to tell you that since you do but see and i do suffer i must of necessity feel more than you cabbala p     birchs memoirs vol ii p     speed p     the whole letter is so curious and so spirited that the reader may not be displeased to read it my very good lord though there is not that man this day living whom i would sooner make judge of any question that might concern me than yourself yet you must give me leave to tell you that in some cases i must appeal from all earthly judges and if in any then surely in this when the highest judge  earth has imposed on me the heaviest punishment without trial or hearing since then i must either answer your lordships argument or else forsake mine own just defense i will force mine aching head to do me service for an hour i must first deny my discontent which was forced to be an humourous discontent and that it was unseasonable or is of so long continuing your lordship should rather condole with me than expostulate natural seasons are expected here below but violent and unreasonable storms come from above there is no tempest equal to the passionate indignation of a prince nor yet at any time so unseasonable as when it sighteth on those that might expect a harvest of their careful and painful labors he that is once wounded must needs feel smart till his hurt is cured or the part hurt become senseless but cure i expect none her majestys heart being obdurate against me and be without sense i cannot being of flesh and blood but say you i may aim at the end i do more than aim for i see an end of all my fortunes i have set an end to all my desires in this course do i any thing for my enemies when i was at court i found them absolute and therefore i had rather they should triumph alone than have me attendant upon their chariots or do i leave my friends when i was a courtier i could yield them no fruit of my love unto them and now that i am a hermit they shall bear no envy for their love toward me or do i forsake myself because i do enjoy myself or do i overthrow my fortunes because i build not a fortune of paper walls which every puff of wind blows down or do i ruinate mine honor because i leave following the pursuit or wearing the false badge or mark of the shadow of honor do i give courage or comfort to the foreign foe because i reserve myself to encounter with him or because i keep my heart from business though i cannot keep my fortune from declining no no my good lord i give every one of these considerations its due weight and the more i weigh them the more i find myself justified from offending in any of them as for the two last objections that i forsake my country when it has most need of me and fail in that indissoluble duty which i owe to my sovereign i answer that if my country had at this time any need of my public service her majesty that governs it would not have driven me to a private life i am tied to my country by two bonds one public to discharge carefully and industriously that trust which is committed to me the other private to sacrifice for it my life and carcass which has been nourished in it of the first i am free being dismissed discharged and disabled by her majesty of the other nothing can free me but death and therefore no occasion of my performance shall sooner offer itself but i shall meet it half way the indissoluble duty which i owe unto her majesty is only the duty of allegiance which i never have nor ever can fail in the duty of attendance is no indissoluble duty i owe her majesty the duty of an earl and of lord marshal of england i have been content to do her majesty the service of a clerk but i can never serve her as a villain or a slave but yet you say i must give way unto the time so i do for now that i see the storm come i have put myself into the harbor senea says we must give way to fortune i know that fortne is both blind and strong and therefore i go as far as i can out of her way you say the remedy is not to strive i neither strive nor seek for remedy but you say i must yield and submit i can neither yield myself to be guilty nor allow the imputation laid upon me to be just i owe so much to the author of all truth as i can never yield truth to be falsehood nor falsehood to be truth have i given cause you ask and yet take a scandal when i have done no i gave no cause not so much as fimbrias complaint against me for i did totum telum corpore recipere receive the whole sword into my body i patiently bear all and sensibly feel all that i then received when this scandal was given me nay more when the vilest of all indignities are done unto me etc this noble letter bacon afterward in pleading against essex called bold and presumptuous and derogatory to her majesty birchs memoirs vol ii p       this spirited letter was shown by essex to his friends and they were so imprudent as to disperse copies of it yet notwithstanding this additional provocation the queens partiality was so prevalent that she reinstated him in his former favor and her kindness toward him appeared rather to have acquired new force from that short interruption of anger and resentment   august the death of lord burleigh his antagonist which happened about this time seemed to ensure him a constant possession of the queens confidence and nothing indeed but his own indiscretion could thenceforth have shaken his well established credit lord burleigh died in an advanced age and by a rare fortune was equally regretted by his sovereign and the people he had risen gradually from small beginnings by the mere force of merit and though his authority was never entirely absolute or uncontrouled with the queen he was still during a course of near forty years regarded as her principal minister none of her other inclinations or affections could ever overcome her confidence in so useful a counselor and as he had had the generosity or good sense to pay assiduous court to her during her sisters reign when it was dangerous to appear her friend she thought herself bound in gratitude when she mounted the throne to persevere in her attachments to him he seems not to have possessed any shining talents of address eloquence or imagination and was chiefly distinguished by solidity of understanding probity of manners and indefatigable application in business virtues which if they do not always enable a man to rise to high stations do certainly qualify him best for filling them of all the queens ministers he was the only one who left a considerable fortune to his posterity a fortune not acquired by rapine or oppression but gained by the regular profits of his offices and preserved by frugality    august the last act of this able minister was the concluding a new treaty with the dutch who after being in some measure deserted by the king of france were glad to preserve the queens alliance by submitting to any terms which she pleased to require of them the debt which they owed the queen was now fixed at eight hundred thousand pounds of this sum they agreed to pay during the war thirty thousand pounds a year and these payments were to continue till four hundred thousand pounds of the debt should be extinguished they engaged also during the time that england should continue the war with spain to pay the garrison of the cautionary towns they stipulated that if spain should invade england or the isle of wight or jersey or scilly they should assist her with a body of five thousand foot and five hundred horse and that in case she undertook any naval armament against spain they should join an equal number of ships to hers rymer vol xvi p   0  by this treaty the queen was eased of an annual charge of an hundred and twenty thousand pounds  soon after the death of burleigh the queen who regreted extremely the loss of so wise and faithful a minister was informed of the death of her capital enemy philip the second who after languishing under many infirmities expired in an advanced age at madrid this haughty prince desirous of an accommodation with his revolted subjects in the netherlands but disdaining to make in his own name the concessions requisite for that purpose had transferred to his daughter married to the archduke albert the property of the low country provinces but as it was not expected that that princess could have any posterity and as the reversion in case of the failure of her issue was stillreserved to the crown of spain the states considered this deed only as the change of a name and persisted with equal obstinacy in their resistance to the spanish arms the other states also of europe made no distinction between the courts of brussels and madrid and the secret opposition of france as well as the avowed force of england continued to operate against the progress of albert as it had done against that of philip  chap vii state of ireland  tyrones rebellion

thought of for the preserving dominion over its conquered provinces  the english nation all on fire for the project of subduing france a project whose success was the most improbable and would to them have proved the most pernicious neglected all other enterprises to which their situation so strongly invited them and which in time would have brought them an accession of riches grandeur and security the small army which they maintained in ireland they never supplied regularly with pay and as no money could be levied from the island which possessed none they gave their soldiers the privilege of free quarter upon the natives rapine and insolence inflamed the hatred which prevailed between the conquerors and the conquered want of security among the irish introducing despair nourished still farther the sloth so natural to that uncultivated people  but the english carried farther their illjudged tyranny instead of inviting the irish to adopt the more civilized customs of their conquerors they even refused though earnestly solicited to communicate to them the privilege of their laws and every where marked them out as aliens and as enemies thrown out of the protection of justice the natives could find security no where but in force and flying the neighborhood of cities which they could not approach with safety they sheltered themselves in their marshes and forests from the insolence of their inhuman masters being treated like wild beasts they became such and joining the ardor of revenge to their yet untamed barbarity they grew every day more intractable and dangerous  as the english princes esteemed the conquest of the dispersed irish to be more the object of time and patience than the source of military glory they willingly delegated that office to private adventurers who inlisting soldiers at their own charge conquered provinces of that island which they converted to their own profit separate jurisdictions and principalities were established by these lordly conquerors the power of peace and war was assumed military law was exercised over the irish whom they subdued and by degrees over the english by whose assistance they conquered and after their dominion had once taken root deeming the english institutions less favorable to barbarous empire they degenerated into mere irish and abandoned the garb language manners and laws of their native country  by all this imprudent conduct of england the natives of its dependant state remained still in that abject condition into which the northern and western parts of europe were sunk before they received civility and slavery from the refined policy and irresistible bravery of rome even at the end of the sixteenth century when every christian nation was cultivating with ardour every civil art of life that island lying in a temperate climate enjoying a fertile soil accessible in its situation possessed of innumerable harbors was still notwithstanding these advantages inhabited by a people whose customs and manners approached nearer those of savages than of barbarians  as the brutality and ignorance of the irish was extreme they were sunk below the reach of that curiosity and love of novelty by which every other people in europe had been seized at the beginning of that century and which had engaged them in innovations and religious disputes with which they were still so violently agitated the ancient superstition the practices and observances of their fathers mingled and polluted with many wild opinions still maintained an unshaken empire over them and the example alone of the english was sufficient to render the reformation odious to the prejudiced and discontented irish the old opposition of manners laws and interest was now inflamed by religious antipathy and the subduing and civilizing that country seemed to become every day more difficult and more impracticable  the animosity against the english was carried so far by the irish that in an insurrection raised by two sons of the earl of clanricard they put to the sword the whole inhabitants of the town of athenry though irish because they began to conform themselves to english customs and institutions and

occasion instead of subduing a mutinous kingdom served rather to provoke the natives and to excite those frequent insurrections and rebellions which still farther inflamed the animosity between the two nations and increased the barbarity and disorders to which the irish were naturally subject  in    0 shan oneale or the great oneale as the irish called him because head of that potent clan raised

undertake a new insurrection in      but being pushed by sir henry sidney lord deputy he retreated into clandeboy and rather than submit to the english he put himself into the hands of some scotch islanders who commonly infested those parts by their incursions the scotch who retained a quarrel against him on account of former injuries violated the laws of hospitality and murdered him in a

death because they endeavored to introduce the use of bread after the english fashion ibid p  0   though so violent an enemy to luxury he was extremely addicted to riot and was accustomed after his intemperance had thrown him into a fever to plunge his body into mire that he might allay the flame which he had raised by former excesses ibid p  0  cox p      such was the life led by this haughty

much encouragement and great rewards from philip who intended to make use of him as an instrument to disturb queen elizabeth he was found to possess too little interest for executing those high

lord gray succeeded sydney in the government of ireland and in      suppressed a new rebellion of the earl of desmond though supported by a body of spaniards and italians the rebellion of the bourks

vassals stowe p   0  the queen finding ireland so burdensome to her tried several expedients for reducing it to a state of greater order and submission she encouraged the earl of essex father to that nobleman who was afterward her favorite to attempt the subduing and planting clandeboy ferny and other territories part of some late forfeitures but that enterprise proved unfortunate and essex died of a distemper occasioned as is supposed by the vexation which he had conceived from his disappointments an university was founded in dublin with a view of introducing arts and learning into that kingdom and civilizing the uncultivated manners of the inhabitants camden p      but the most unhappy expedient employed in the government of ireland was that made use of in      by sir john perrot at that time lord deputy he put arms into the hands of the irish inhabitants of ulster in order to enable them without the assistance of the government to repress the incursions of the scotch islanders by which these parts were much infested nantons fragmenta regalia p  0   at the same time the invitations of philip joined to their zeal for the catholic religion engaged many of the gentry to serve in the low country wars and thus ireland being provided both of officers and soldiers of discipline and arms became formidable to the english and was able to maintain a more regular war against her ancient masters  tyrones rebellion hugh oneale nephew to shan oneale had been raised by the queen to the dignity of earl of tyrone but having murdered his cousin son to that rebel and being acknowledged head of his clan he preferred the pride of barbarous license and dominion to the pleasures of opulence and tranquillity and fomented all those disorders by which he hoped to weaken or overturn the english government he was noted for the vices of perfidy and cruelty so common among uncultivated nations and was also eminent for courage a virtue which their disorderly course of life requires and which notwithstanding being unsupported by the principle of honor is commonly more precarious among them than among a civilized people tyrone actuated by this spirit secretly fomented the discontents of the maguires odonnels orourks macmahons and other rebels yet trusting to the influence of his deceitful oaths and professions he put himself into the hands of sir william russel who in the year      was sent over lord deputy into ireland contrary to the advice and protestation of sir henry bagnal marshal of the army he was dismissed and returning to his own country he embraced the resolution of raising an open rebellion and of relying no longer on the lenity or inexperience of the english government he entered into a correspondence with spain he procured thence a supply of arms and ammunition and having united all the irish chieftains in a dependence upon him he began to be regarded as a formidable enemy  the native irish were so miserably poor that their country afforded few other commodities but cattle and oatmeal which were easily destroyed or driven away on the approach of the enemy and as elizabeth was averse to the expense requisite for supporting her armies the english found much difficulty in pushing their advantages and in pursuing the rebels into the bogs woods and other fastnesses to which they retreated these motives made sir john norris who commanded the english army the more ready to hearken to any proposals of accommodation made him by tyrone and after the war was spun out by these artifices for some years that gallant englishman finding that he had been deceived by treacherous promises and that he had performed nothing worthy of his ancient reputation was seized with a languishing distemper and died of vexation and discontent sir henry bagnal who succeeded him in the command was still more unfortunate as he advanced to relieve the sort of blackwater besieged by the rebels he was surrounded in disadvantageous ground his soldiers discouraged by their powders accidentally taking fire were put to flight and though the pursuit was stopped by montacute who commanded the english horse fifteen hundred men together with the general himself were left dead upon the spot this victory so unusual to the irish mightily raised their spirits supplied them with arms and ammunition and exalted the reputation of tyrone who assumed the character of the deliverer of his country and patron of irish liberty cox p       the english council were now sensible that the rebellion in ireland was come to a dangerous head and that the former temporizing arts of granting truces and pacifications to the rebels and of allowing them to purchase pardons by resigning part of the plunder acquired during their insurrections served only to encourage the spirit of mutiny and disorder among them it was therefore resolved to push the war by vigorous measures and the queen cast her eye on charles blount lord mountjoy as a man who though hitherto less accustomed to arms than to books and literature was endowed she thought with talents equal to that undertaking but the young earl of essex ambitious of glory and desirous of obtaining this government for himself opposed the choice of mountjoy and represented the necessity of appointing for that important employment some person more experienced in war than this nobleman more practiced in business and of higher quality and reputation by this description he was understood to mean himself bacon vol iv p      and no sooner was his desire known to be possessed of that government than his enemies even more zealously than his friends conspired to render his wishes effectual many of his friends thought that he never should consent except for a very short time to accept of employments which must remove him from court and prevent him from cultivating that personal inclination which the queen so visibly bore him cabbasa p     his enemies hoped that if by his absence she had once leizure to forget the charms of his person and conversation his impatient and lofty demeanor would soon disgust a princess who usually exacted such profound submission and implicit obedience from all her servants essex sent over to ireland but essex was incapable of entering into such cautious views and even elizabeth who was extremely desirous of subdoing the irish rebels and who was much prepossessed in favor of essexs genius readily agreed to appoint him governor of ireland under the title of lord lieutenant the more to encourage him in his undertaking she granted him by his patent more extensive authority than had ever before been conferred on any lieutenant the power of carrying on or finishing the war as he pleased of pardoning the rebels and of filling all the most considerable employments of the kingdom rymer tom xvi p      and to ensure him of success she levied a numerous army of sixteen thousand foot and thirteen hundred horse which she afterward augmented to twenty thousand foot and two thousand horse a force which it was apprehended would be able in one campaign to overwhelm the rebels and make an entire conquest of ireland nor did essexs enemies the earl of nottingham lord admiral sir robert cecil secretary sir walter raleigh and lord cobham throw any obstacles in the way of these preparations but hoped that the higher the queens expectations were raised of success the more difficult it would be for the event to correspond to them in a like view they rather seconded than opposed those exalted encomiums which essexs numerous and sanguine friends dispersed of his high genius of his elegant endowments his heroic courage his unbounded generosity and his noble birth nor were they displeased to observe that passionate fondness which the people every where expressed for this nobleman these artful politicians had studied his character and finding that his open and undaunted spirit if taught temper and reserve from opposition must become invincible they resolved rather to give full breath to those sails which were already too much expanded and to push him upon dangers of which he seemed to make such small account camden osborne p      and the better to make advantage of his indiscretions spies were set upon all his actions and even expressions and his vehement spirit which while he was in the midst of the court and environed by his rivals was unacquainted with disguise could not fail after he thought himself surrounded by none but friends to give a pretense for malignant suspicions and constructions  essex left london in the month of march attended by the acclamations of the populace and what did him more honor accompanied by a numerous train of nobility and gentry who from affection to his person had attached themselves to all his fortunes and proposed to acquire fame and military experience under so renowned a commander the first act of authority which he exercised after his arrival in ireland was an indiscretion but of the generous kind and in both these respects suitable to his character he appointed his intimate friend the earl of southampton general of the horse a nobleman who had displeased the queen by secretly marrying without her consent and whom she had therefore enjoined essex not to employ in any command under him she no sooner heard of this instance of disobedience than she reprimanded him and ordered him to recall his commission to southampton but essex who had imagined that some reasons which he opposed to her first injunctions had convinced her had the imprudence to remonstrate against these second orders birchs memoirs vol ii p          and it was not till she reiterated her commands that he could be prevailed on to displace his friend  his ill success essex on his landing at dublin had deliberated with the irish council concerning the proper methods of carrying on war against the rebels and here he was guilty of a capital error which was the ruin of his enterprise he had always while in england blamed the conduct of former commanders who artfully protracted the war who harrassed their troops in small enterprises and who by agreeing to truces and temporary pacifications with the rebels had given them leizure to recruit their broken forces ibid p  bacon vol iv p      in conformity to these views he had ever insisted upon leading his forces immediately into ulster against tyrone the capital enemy and his instructions had been drawn agreeable to these his declared intentions and resolutions but the irish counselors persuaded him that the season was too early for the enterprise and that as the morasses in which the irish usually sheltered themselves would not as yet be penetrable to the english forces it would be better to employ the present time in an expedition into munster their secret reason for this advice was that many of them possessed estates in that province and were desirous to have the enemy dislodged from their neighborhood birchs memoirs vol ii p      but the same selfish spirit which had induced them to give this council made them soon after disown it when they found the bad consequences with which it was attended winwood vol i p   0   essex obliged all the rebels of munster either to submit or to fly into the neighboring provinces but as the irish from the greatness of the queens preparations had concluded that she intended to reduce them to total subjection or even utterly to exterminate them they considered their present defense as a common cause and the english forces were no sooner withdrawn than the inhabitants of munster relapsed into rebellion and renewed their confederacy with their other countrymen the army meanwhile by the fatigue of long and tedious marches and by the influence of the climate was become extreme sickly and on their return to dublin about the middle of july were suprizingly diminished in number their courage was even much abated for though they had prevailed in some lesser enterprises as against the lord cahir and others yet had they sometimes met with a more stout resistance than they expected from the irish whom they were wont to despise and as they were raw troops and unexperienced a considerable body of them had been put to flight at the glins by an inferior number of the enemy essex was so enraged at this misbehaviour that he cashiered all the officers and decimated the private men cox p      but this instance of severity though necessary had intimidated the soldiers and had increased their aversion to the present service  the queen was extremely disgusted when she heard that so considerable a part of the season was consumed in these frivolous enterprises and was still more surprised that essex persevered in the same practice which he had so much condemned in others and which he knew to be so much contrary to her purpose and intention that nobleman in order to give his troops leizure to recruit from their sickness and fatigue marched with a small body of fifteen hundred men into the county of ophelie against the oconnors and omores whom he forced to a submission but on his return to dublin he found the army so extremely diminished that he wrote to the english council an account of his condition and informed them that if he received not immediately a reinforcement of two thousand men it would be impossible for him this season to attempt any thing against tyrone that there might be no pretense for farther inactivity the queen immediately sent over the number demanded birchs memoirs vol ii p   0 cox p      and essex began at last to assemble his forces for the expedition into ulster the army was so extremely averse to this enterprise and terrified with the reputation of tyrone that many of them counterfeited sickness many of them deserted sydneys letters vol ii p          and essex found that after leaving the necessary garrisons he could scarce lead four thousand men against the rebels he marched however with this small army but was soon sensible that in so advanced a season it would be impossible for him to effectuate any thing against an enemy who though superior in number were determined to avoid every decisive action he hearkened therefore to a message sent him by tyrone who desired a conference and a place near the two camps was accordingly appointed the generals met without any of their attendants and a river ran between them into which tyrone entered to the depth of his saddle but essex stood on the opposite bank after half an hours conference where tyrone behaved with great submission and respect to the lord lieutenant a cessation of arms was concluded to the first of may renewable from six weeks to six weeks but which might be broke off by either party upon a fortnights warning ibid p      essex also received from tyrone proposals for a peace in which that rebel had inserted many unreasonable and exorbitant conditions and there appeared afterward some reason to suspect that he had here commenced a very unjustifiable correspondence with the enemy winwood vol i p  0  state trials bacon vol iv p               so unexpected an issue of an enterprise the greatest and most expensive which elizabeth had ever undertaken provoked her extremely against essex and this disgust was much augmented by other circumstances of that noblemans conduct he wrote many letters to the queen and council full of peevish and impatient expressions complaining of his enemies lamenting that their calumnies should be believed against him and discovering symptoms of a mind equally haughty and discontented she took care to inform him of her dissatisfaction but commanded him to remain in ireland till farther orders  essex heard at once of elizabeths anger and of the promotion of his enemy sir robert cecil to the office of master of the wards an office which he himself aspired to and dreading that if he remained any longer absent the queen would be totally alienated from him he hastily embraced a resolution which he knew had once succeeded with the earl of leicester the former favorite of elizabeth leicester being informed while in the low countries that his mistress was extremely displeased with his conduct disobeyed her orders by coming over into england and having pacified her by his presence by his apologies and by his flattery and insinuation disappointed all the expectations of his enemies birchs memoirs vol ii p      returns to england essex therefore weighing more the similarity of circumstances than the difference of characters between himself and leicester immediately set out for england and making speedy journeys he arrived at court before any one was in the least apprized of his intentions winwood vol i p      though besmeared with dirt and sweat he hastened up stairs to the presence chamber thence to the privy chamber nor stopped till he was in the queens bed chamber who was newly risen and was sitting with her hair about her face he threw himself on his knees kissed her hand and had some private conference with her where he was so graciously received that on his departure he was heard to express great satisfaction and to thank god that though he had suffered much trouble and many storms abroad he found a sweet calm at home sydneys letters vol ii p       but this placability of elizabeth was merely the result of her surprise and of the momentary satisfaction which she felt on the sudden and unexpected appearance of her favorite after she had found leizure for recollection all his faults recurred to her memory and she thought it necessary by some severe discipline to subdue this haughty and imperious spirit who presuming on her partiality and indulgence had pretended to domineer in her councils to engross all her favor and to act in the most important affairs without regard to her orders and instructions is disgraced when essex waited on her in the afternoon he found her extremely altered in her carriage toward him she ordered him to be consined to his chamber to be twice examined by the council and though his answers were calm and submissive she committed him to the custody of the lord keeper egerton and held him sequestered from all company even from that of his countess nor was so much as the intercourse of letters permitted between them essex dropped many expressions of humiliation and sorrow none of resentment he prosessed an entire submission to the queens will declared his intention of retiring into the country and of leading thenceforth a private life remote from courts and business but though he assected to be so entirely cured of his aspiring ambition the vexation of this disappointment and of the triumph gained by his enemies preyed upon his haughty spirit and he sell into a distemper which seemed to put his life in hazard  the queen had always declared to all the world and even to the earl himself that the purpose of her severity was to correct not to ruin him birchs memoirs p         sydney papers vol ii p  0   and when she heard of his condition she was not a little alarm d with the danger she ordered eight physicians of the best reputation and experience to consult of his case and being informed that the issue was much to be apprehended she sent dr james to him with some broth and desired that physician to deliver him a message which she probably deemed of still greater virtue that if she thought such a step consistent with her honor she would herself pay him a visit the by standers who carefully observed her countenance remarked that in pronouncing these words her eyes were suffused with tears sydney letters vol ii p       when these symptoms of the queens returning affection towards essex were known they gave a sensible alarm to the faction which had declared their opposition to him sir walter raleigh in particular the most violent as well as the most ambitious of his enemies was so affected with the appearance of that sudden revolution that he was seized with sickness in his turn and the queen was obliged to apply the same salve to his wound and to send him a favorable message expressing her desire of his recovery ibid p       ibid p      and she relapsed into her former rigor against him he wrote her a letter and sent her a rich present on new years day as was usual among the courtiers of that time she read the letter but rejected the present ibid p          after some interval however of severity she allowed him to retire to his own house and though he remained still under custody and was sequestered from all company he was so grateful for this mark of lenity that he sent her a letter of thanks on the occasion this farther degree of goodness said he does sound in mine ears as if your majesty spoke these words die not essex for though i punish thine offense and humble thee for thy good yet will i one day be served again by thee my prostrate soul makes this

sir francis walsingham possessed as well as her husband a very refined taste in literature and the chief consolation which essex enjoyed during this period of anxiety and expectation consisted in her company and in reading with her those instructive and entertaining authors which even during the time of his greatest prosperity he had never entirely neglected  there were several incidents which kept alive the queens anger against essex every account which she received from ireland convinced her more and more of his misconduct in that government and of the insignificant purposes to which he had employed so much force and treasure tyrone so far from being quelled had thought proper in less than three months to break the truce and joining with o donel and other rebels had overrun almost the whole kingdom he boasted that he was certain of receiving a supply of men money and arms from spain he pretended to be champion of the catholic religion and he loudly exulted in the present of a phaenix plume which the pope clement the eighth in order to encourage him in the prosecution of so good a cause had consecrated and had conferred upon him camden p      the queen that she might check his progress returned to her former intention of appointing mountjoy lorddeputy and though that nobleman who was an intimate friend of essex and desired his return to the government of ireland did at first very earnestly excuse himself on account of his bad state of health she obliged him to accept of that employment mountjoy found the island almost in a desperate situation but being a man of capacity and vigor he was so little discouraged that he immediately advanced against tyrone in ulster he penetrated into the heart of that country the chief seat of the rebels he fortified derry and mountnorris in order to bridle the irish he chaced them from the field and obliged them to take shelter in the woods and morasses he employed with equal success sir george carew in munster and by these promising successes he gave new life to the queens authority in that country  as the comparison of mountjoys administration with that of essex contributed to alienate her from her favorite she received additional disgust from the partiality of the people who prepossessed with an extravagant idea of essexs merit complained of the injustice which was done him by his removal from court and by his consinement libels were secretly dispersed against cecil and raleigh and all his enemies and his popularity which was always great seemed rather to be increased than diminished by his misfortunes elizabeth in order to justify to the public her conduct with regard to him had often taken the resolution of having him tried in the star chamber for his offenses but her tenderness for him prevailed at last over her severity and she was contented to have him only examined by the privy council the attorney general coke opened the cause against him and treated him with the cruelty and insolence which that great lawyer usually exercised against the unfortunate he displayed in the strongest colors all the faults committed by essex in his administration of ireland his making southampton general of the horse contrary to the queens injunctions his deserting the enterprise against tyrone and marching to leinster and munster his conferring knighthood on too many persons his secret conference

  the sollicitorgeneral fleming insisted upon the wretched situation in which the earl had left that kingdom and francis bacon son to sir nicholas bacon who had been lord keeper in the beginning of the present reign closed the charge with displaying the undutiful expressions contained in some letters wrote by the earl  essex when his turn came to plead in his own behalf renounced with great submission and humility all pretensions to an apology sydneys letters vol ii p  00  and declared his resolution never on this or any other occasion to have any contest with his sovereign he said that having severed himself from the world and abjured all sentiments of ambition he had no scruple to confess every failing or error into which his youth folly or manifold infirmities might have betrayed him that his inward sorrow for his offenses against her majesty was so profound that it exceeded all his outward crosses and afflictions nor did he retain any scruple of submitting to a public confession of whatever she had been pleased to impute to him that in his acknowlegements he retained only one reserve which he never would relinquish but with his life the assertion of a loyal and unpolluted heart of an unfeigned affection of an earnest desire ever to perform to her majesty the best service which his poor abilities would permit and that if this sentiment was recognized by the council he willingly acquiesced in any condemnation or sentence which they could pronounce against him this submission was uttered with so much eloquence and in so pathetic a manner that it drew tears from many of the spectators sydneys letters vol ii p  00  0   all the privycounsellors in giving their judgment made no scruple of doing the earl justice with regard to the loyalty of his intentions even cecil whom he believed his capital enemy treated him with regard and humanity and the sentence given by the lord keeper to which the council assented was in these words if this cause said he had been heard in the star chamber my sentence must have been for as great a fine as ever was set upon any mans head in that court together with perpetual confinement in that prison which belongs to a man of his quality the tower but since we are now in another place and in a course of favor my censure is that the earl of essex is not to execute the office of a counselor nor that of earl marshal of england nor of master of the ordinance and to return to his own house there to continue a prisoner till it shall please her majesty to release this and all the rest of his sentence birchs memoirs vol ii p     camden p        the earl of cumberland made a slight opposition to this sentence and said that if he thought it would stand he would have required a little longer time to deliberate that he thought it somewhat severe and that any commander in chief might easily incur a like penalty but however added he in confidence of her majestys mercy i agree with the rest the earl of worcester delivered his opinion in a couple of latin verses implying that where the gods are offended even misfortunes ought to be imputed as crimes and that accident is no excuse for transgressions against the divinity  bacon so much distinguished afterward by his high offices and still more by his profound genius for the sciences was nearly allied to the cecil family being nephew to lord burleigh and cousingerman to the secretary but notwithstanding his extraordinary talents he had met with so little protection from his powerful relations that he had not yet obtained any preferment in the law which was his profession but essex who could distinguish merit and who passionately loved it had entered into an intimate friendship with bacon had zealously attempted though without success to procure him the office of queens solicitor and in order to comfort his friend under the disappointment had conferred on him a present of land to the value of eighteen hundred pounds cabbala p     the public could ill excuse bacons appearance before the council against so munificent a benefactor though he acted in obedience to the queens orders but she was so well pleased with his behavior that she imposed on him a new task of drawing a narrative of that days proceedings in order to satisfy the nation of the justice and lenity of her conduct bacon who wanted firmness of character more than humanity gave to the whole transaction the most favorable turn for essex and in particular painted out in elaborate expression the dutiful submission which that nobleman discovered in the defense which he made for his conduct when he read the paper to her she smiled at that passage and observed to bacon that old love she saw could not easily be forgotten he replied that he hoped she meant that o herself cabbala p      all the world indeed expected that essex would soon be reinstated in his former credit winwood vol l p      perhaps as is usual in reconcilements founded on inclination would acquire an additional ascendant with the queen and after all his dilgraces would again appear more a favorite than ever they were confirmed in this hope when they saw that though he was still prohibited to appear at court birchs memoirs vol ii p      he was continued in his office of master of horse and was restored to his liberty and that all his friends had access to him essex himself seemed determined to persevere in that conduct which had hitherto been so successful and which the queen by all this discipline had endeavored to render habitual to him he wrote to her that he kissed her majestys hands and the rod with which she had corrected him but that he could never recover his usual cheerfulness till she deigned to admit him to that presence which had ever been the chief source of his happiness and enjoyment and that he had now resolved to make amends for his past errors to retire into a country solitude and to say with nebuchadnezzar let my dwelling be with the beasts of the field let me eat grass as an ox and be wet with the dew of heaven till it shall please the queen to restore me to my understanding the queen was much pleased with these sentiments and replied that she heartily wished his actions might correspond to his expressions that he had tried her patience a long time and it was but just she should now make some experiment of his submission that her father would never have pardoned so much obstinacy but that if the furnace of affliction produced such good effects she should ever after have the better opinion of her chemistry camden p       the earl of essex possessed a monopoly of sweet wines and as his patent was near expiring he patiently expected that the queen would renew it and considered this event as the critical circumstance of his life which would determine whether he could ever hope to be reinstated in credit and authority birchs memoris vol ii p   but elizabeth though gracious in her demeanor was of a temper somewhat haughty and severe and being continually surrounded with essexs enemies means were found to persuade her that his lofty spirit was not yet sufficiently humbled and that he must undergo this farther trial before he could again be safely received into favor she therefore refused his demand and even added in a contemptuous style that an ungovernable beast must be stinted in his provender camden p       his intrigues this rigor pushed one step too far proved the final ruin of this young nobleman and was the source of infinite sorrow and vexation to the queen herself essex who had with great difficulty o long subdued his proud spirit and whose patience was now exhausted imagining that the queen was entirely inexorable burst at once all restraints of submission and of prudence and was determined to seek relief by proceeding to the utmost extremities against his enemies even during his greatest favor he had ever been accustomed to carry matters with a high hand against his sovereign and as this practice gratified his own temper and was sometimes successful he had imprudently imagined that it was the only proper method of managing her cabbala p     but being now reduced to despair he gave entire reins to his violent disposition and threw off all appearance of duty and respect intoxicated with the general favor which he already possessed he practiced anew every art of popularity and endeavored to increase the general good will by an hospitable manner of life little suited to his situation and his circumstances his former employments had given him great connections with gentlemen of the military profession and he now entertained by additional caresses and civilities a friendship with all desperate adventurers whose attachment he hoped might in his present views prove serviceable to him he secretly courted the confidence of the catholics but his chief trust lay in the puritans whom he openly caressed and whose manners he seemed to have entirely adopted he engaged the most celebrated preachers of that sect to resort to essexhouse he had daily prayers and sermons in his family and he invited all the zealots in london to attend those pious exercises such was the disposition now beginning to prevail among the english that instead of feasting and public spectacles the methods anciently practiced in commonwealths to gain the populace nothing so effectually ingratiated an ambitions leader with the public as these fanatical entertainments and as the puritanical preachers frequently inculcated in their sermons the doctrine of resistance to the civil magistrate they prepared the minds of their hearers for those purposes which essex was secretly contriving birchs memoirs vol ii p     camden p   0   but the most pernicious imprudence of this nobleman proceeded from the openness of his temper by which he was ill qualified to suceeed in such difficult and dangerous projects he indulged himself in great liberties of speech and was even heard to say of the queen that she was now grown an old woman and was become as crooked in her mind as in her body camden p     osborne p    sir walter raleighs prerogative of parliaments p     some court ladies whose favors essex had formerly neglected carried her these stories and incensed her to a high degree against him elizabeth was ever remarkably jealous on this head and though she was now approaching to her seventieth year she allowed her courtiers birchs memoirs vol ii p          and even foreign ambassadors sydneys letters vol ii p      to compliment her upon her beauty nor had all her good sense been able to cure her of this preposterous infirmity most of queen elizabeths courtiers feigned love and desire toward her and addressed themselves to her in the style of passion and gallantry sir walter raleigh having fallen into disgrace wrote the following letter to his friend sir robert cecil with a view no doubt of having it shown to the queen my heart was never broke till this day that i hear the queen goes away so far off whom i have followed so many years with so great love and desire in so many journeys and am now left behind her in a dark prison all alone while she was yet near at hand that i might hear of her once in two or three days my sorrows were the less but even now my heart is cast into the depth of all misery i that was wont to behold her riding like alexander hunting like diana walking like venus the gentle wind blowing her fair hair about her pure cheeks like a nymph sometimes sitting in the shade like a goddess sometimes singing like an angel sometimes playing like orpheus behold the sorrow of this world once amiss has bereaved me of all o glory that only shines in misfortune what is become of thy assurance all wounds have scars but that of fantasy all affections their relenting but that of womankind who is the judge of friendship but adversity or when is grace witnessed but in offenses there were no divinity but by reason of compassion for revenges are brutish and mortal all those times past the loves the sighs the sorrows the desires cannot they weigh down one frail misfortune cannot one drop of gall be hid in so great heaps of sweetness i may then conclude spes and fortune valete she is gone in whom i trusted and of me has not one thought of mercy nor any respect of that which was do with me now therefore what you list i am more weary of life than they are desirous i should perish which if it had been for her as it is by her i had been too happily born murdin     it is to be remarked that this nymph venus

you i made some difficulties yet upon his importunity offered it to his view very secretly holding it still in my hand he beheld it with passion and admiration saying that i had reason j me rend protesting that he had never seen the like so with great reverence he kissed it twice or thrice i detaining it still in my hand in the end with some kind of contention he took it from me vowing that i might take my leave of it for he would not forgo it for any treasure and that to possess the favor of the lively picture he would forsake all the world and hold himself most happy with many other most passionate speeches murdin p     for farther particulars on this head see the ingenious author of the catalogue of royal and noble authors article essex   there was another expedient of essex which if possible was more provoking to the queen than those sarcasms on her age and deformity and that was his secret applications to the king of scots her heir and successor that prince had this year very narrowly escaped a dangerous though ill formed conspiracy of the earl of gowry and even his delivery was attended with this disagreeable circumstance that the obstinate ecclesiastics persisted in spite of the most incontestible evidence to maintain to his face that there had been no such conspiracy james harrassed with his turbulent and factious subjects cast a wistful eye to the succession of england and in proportion as the queen advanced in years his desire increased of mounting that throne on which besides acquiring a great addition of power and splendour he hoped to govern a people so much more tractable and submissive he negociated with all the courts of europe in order to ensure himself friends and partisans he even neglected not the court of rome and that of spain and though he engaged himself in no positive promise he flattered the catholics with hopes that in case of his succession they might expect some more liberty than what was at present indulged them elizabeth was the only sovereign in europe to whom he never dared to mention his right of succession he knew that though her great age might now invite her to think of fixing an heir to the crown she never could bear the prospect of her own death without horror and was determined still to retain him and all other competitors in an entire dependence upon her  essex was descended by females from the royal family and some of his sanguine partisans had been so imprudent as to mention his name among those of other pretenders to the crown but the earl took care by means of henry lee whom he secretly sent into scotland to assure james that so far from entertaining such ambitious views he was determined to use every expedient for extorting an immediate declaration in favor of this monarchs right of succession james willingly hearkened to this proposal but did not approve of the violent methods which essex intended to employ essex had communicated his scheme to mountjoy lord deputy of ireland and as no man ever commanded more the cordial affection and attachment of his friends he had even engaged a person of that virtue and prudence to entertain thoughts of bringing over part of his army into england and of forcing the queen to declare the king of scots her successor birchs memoirs vol ii p     and such was essexs impatient ardour that though james declined this dangerous expedient he still endeavored to persuade mountjoy not to desist from the project but the deputy who thought that such violence though it might be prudent and even justifiable when supported by a sovereign prince next heir to the crown would be rash and criminal if attempted by subjects entirely refused his concurrence the correspondence however between essex and the court of scotland was still conducted with great secrecy and cordiality and that nobleman besides conciliating the favor of james represented all his own adversaries as enemies to that princes succession and as men entirely devoted to the interests of spain and partisans of the chimerical title of the infanta  the infanta and archduke albert had made some advances to the queen for peace and boulogne as a neutral town was chosen for the place of conference    may sir henry neville the english resident in france herbert edmondes and beale ere sent thither as ambassadors from england and negociated with zuniga carillo richardot and verheiken ministers of spain and the archduke but the conferences were soon broke off on account of a dispute of ceremony among the european states england had ever been allowed the precedence above castile arragon portugal and the other kingdoms of which the spanish monarchy was composed and elizabeth insisted that this ancient right was not lost on account of the junction of these states and that spain in its present situation though it surpassed england in extent as well as in power could not compare with it in point of antiquity the only durable and regular foundation of precedence among kingdoms as well as noble families that she might show however a disposition to peace she was contented to yield to an equality but the spanish ministers as their country had always disputed precedence even with france to which england submitted would proceed no farther in the conferences till their superiority of rank was acknowleged winwoods memols vol l p      during the preparations for this abortive negotiation the earl of uttingham the admiral lord buckhurst the treasurer and secretary cecil had discovered their innation to peace and as the english nation flushed with success and sanguine in the hopes of plunder and conqued were in general averse to that  i was easy for a person so popular as essex to infuse into the multitude an opinion that these ministers had sacrificed the interests of their  to spain and would even make no scruple of receiving a sovereign from that hostile nation  his insurrection it was agreed that sir christopher blount with a choice detachment should possess himself of the palace gates that davis should seize the hall davers the guardchamber and presence chamber and that essex should rush in from the meuse attended by a body of his partisans should entreat the queen with all demonstrations of humility to remove his enemies should oblige her to assemble a parliament and should with common consent settle a new plan of government camden p   0 birchs memoirs vol ii p     state trials bacon vol iv p           while these desperate projects were in agitation many reasons of suspicion were carried to the queen and she sent robert sacville the treasurers son to essexhouse under pretense of a visit but in reality with a view of discovering whether there was in that place any concourse of people or any extraordinary preparations which might threaten an insurrection soon after essex received a summons to attend the council which met at the treasurers house and while he was musing on this circumstance and comparing it with the late unexpected visit from sacville a private note was conveyed to him by which he was warned to provide for his own safety he concluded that all his conspiracy was discovered or at least suspected and that the easiest punishment which he could expect was a new and more severe consinement he therefore excused himself to the council on pretense of an indisposition and he immediately dispatched messages to his more intimate confederates requesting their advice and assistance in the present critical situation of his affairs they deliberated whether they should abandon all their projects and fly the kingdom or instantly seize the palace with the force which they could assemble or rely upon the affections of the citizens who were generally known to bear a great affection to the earl essex declared against the first expedient and professed himself determined to undergo any fate rather than submit to live the life of a fugitive to seize the palace seemed impracticable without more preparation especially as the queen seemed now aware of their projects and as they heard had used the precaution of doubling her ordinary guards there remained therefore no other expedient but that of betaking themselves to the city and while the prudence and expediency of this resolution was under debate a person arrived who as if he had received a commission for that purpose gave them assurance of the good affection of the londoners and affirmed that they might securely rest any project on that foundation the popularity of essex had chiefly buoyed him up in all his vain undertakings and he fondly imagined that with no other assistance than the good will of the multitude he might be enabled to overturn elizabeths government confirmed by time revered for wisdom supported by vigor and concurring with the general sentiments of the nation the wild project of raising the city was immediately resolved on the execution of it was delayed till next day and emissaries were dispatched to all essexs friends informing them that cobham and raleigh had laid schemes against his life and entreating their presence and assistance   th february next day there appeared at essexhouse the earls of southampton and rutland the lords sandys and monteagle with about three hundred gentlemen of good quality and fortune and essex informed them of the danger to which he pretended the machinations of his enemies exposed him to some he said that he would throw himself at the queens feet and crave her justice and protection to others he boasted of his interest in the city and affirmed that whatever might happen this resource could never fail him the queen was informed of these designs by means of intelligence conveyed as is supposed to raleigh by sir ferdinando gorges and having ordered the magistrates of london to keep the citizens in readiness she sent egerton lord keeper to essexhouse with the earl of worcester sir william knollys controller and popam lord chief justice in order to learn the cause of these unusual commotions they were with difficulty admitted through a wicket but all their servants were excluded except the pursebearer after some alternation in which they charged essexs retainers upon their allegiance to lay down their army and were in traced in their turn by the angry multitude who surrounded them the earl who found that matters were past rec resolved to  them prisoners in his house and to proceed to the execution of his former project he issued out with about two hundred attendants armed only with swords and in his passage to the city was joined by the earl of bedford and lord cromwell he cried aloud for the queen for the queen a plot is laid for my life and then proceeded to the house of smith the sheriff on whose aid he had great reliance the citizens flocked about him in amazement but though he told them that england was sold to the infanta and exhorted them to arm instantly otherwise they could not do him any service no one showed a disposition to join him the sheriff on the earls approach to his house stole out at the back door and made the best of his way to the lord mayor essex meanwhile observing the coldness of the citizens and hearing that he was proclaimed a traitor by the earl of cumberland and lord burleigh began to despair of success and thought of retreating to his own house he found the streets in his passage barricadoed and guarded by the citizens under the command of sir john levison in his attempt to force his way tracy a young gentleman to whom he bore great friendship was killed with two or three of the londoners and the earl himself attended by a few of his partisans for the greatest part began secretly to withdraw themselves retired toward the river and taking boat arrived at essexhouse he there found that gorges whom he had sent before to capitulate with the lord keeper and the other counselors had given them all their liberty and had gone to court with them he was now reduced to despair and appeared determined in prosecution of lord sandyss advice to defend himself to the last extremity and rather to perish like a brave man with his sword in his hand than basely by the hands of the executioner but after some parley and after demanding in vain first hostages then conditions from the besiegers he surrendered at discretion requesting only civil treatment and a fair and impartial hearing camden p       the queen who during all this commotion had behaved with as great tranquillity and security as if there had only passed a fray in the streets in which she was no way concerned birchs memoirs vol ii p      soon gave orders for the trial of the most considerable of the criminals   th february his trial the earls of essex and southampton were arraigned before a jury of twentyfive peers where buckhurst acted as lord steward the guilt of the prisoners was too apparent to admit of any doubt and besides the insurrection known to every body the treasonable conferences at druryhouse were proved by undoubted evidence sir ferdinando gorges was produced in court the confessions of the earl of rutland of the lords cromwell sandys and monteagle of davers blount and davies were only read to the peers according to the practice of that age essexs best friends were scandalized at his assurance in insisting so positively on his innocence and the goodness of his intentions and still more at his vindictive disposition in accusing without any appearance of reason secretary cecil as a partizan of the infantas title the secretary who had expected this charge stepped into the court and challenged essex to produce his authority which on examination was found extremely weak and frivolous bacon vol iv p   0  when sentence was pronounced essex spoke like a man who laid his account to die but he added that he should be sorry if he was represented to the queen as a person that despised her clemency though he should not he believed make any cringing submissions to obtain it southamptons behavior was more mild and submissive he entreated the good offices of the peers in so modest and becoming a manner as excited compassion in every one  the most remarkable circumstance in essexs trial was bacons appearance against him he was none of the crown lawyers so was not obliged by his office to assist at this trial yet did he not scruple in order to obtain the queens favor to be active in bereaving of life his friend and patron whose generosity he had often experienced he compared essexs conduct in pretending to fear the attempts of his adversaries to that of pisistratus the athenian who cut and wounded his own body and making the people believe that his enemies had committed that violence obtained a guard for his person by whose assistance he afterward subdued the liberties of his country  after essex had passed some days in the folitude and reflection of a prison his proud heart was at last subdued not by the fear of death but by the sentiments of religion a principle which he had before attempted to make the instrument of his ambition but which now took a more firm hold of his mind and prevailed over every other motive and consideration his spiritual directors persuaded him that he never could obtain the pardon of heaven unless he made a full confession of his disloyalty and he gave in to the council an account of all his most criminal designs as well as of his correspondence with the king of scots he spared not even his most intimate friends such as lord mountjoy whom he had engaged in these conspiracies and he ought to pacify his present remorse by making such attonements as in any other period of his life he would have deemed more blameable than those attempts themselves which were the objects of his penitence winwood vol i p  0  sir harry neville in particular a man of merit he accused of a correspondence with the conspirators though it appears that that gentleman had never assented to the proposals made him and was no farther criminal than in not revealing the earls treason an office to which every man of honor naturally bears the strongest reluctance winwood vol i p     neville was thrown into prison and underwent a severe persecution but as the queen found mountjoy a very able and successful commander she continued him in his government and sacrificed her resentment to the public service  elizabeth affected extremely the praise of clemency and in every great example which she had made during her reign she had always appeared full of reluctance and hesitation but the present situation of essex called forth all her tender affections and kept her in the most real agitation and irresolution she felt a perpetual combat between resentment and inclination pride and compassion the care of her own safety and concern for her favorite and her situation during this interval was perhaps more an object of pity than that to which essex himself was reduced she signed the warrant for his execution she countermanded it she again resolved on his death she felt a new return of tenderness essexs enemies told her that he himself desired to die and had assured her that she could never be in safety while he lived it is likely that this proof of penitence and of concern for her would operate a contrary effect to what they intended and would revive all that fond affection which she had so long indulged to the unhappy prisoner but what chiefly hardened her heart against him was his supposed obstinacy in never making as she hourly expected any application to her for mercy and forgiveness and she finally gave her consent to his execution he discovered at his death symptoms rather of penitence and piety than of fear and willingly acknowleged the justice of the sentence by which he suffered   th february and execution the execution was private in the tower agreeable to his own request he was apprehensive he said lest the favor and compassion of the people would too much raise his heart in those moments when humiliation under the afflicting hand of heaven was the only proper sentiment which he could indulge dr barlows sermon on essexs execution bacon vol iv      and the queen no doubt thought that prudence required the removal of so melancholy a spectacle from the public eye sir walter raleigh who came to the tower on purpose and who beheld essexs execution from a window increased much by this action the general hatred under which he already labored it was thought that he had no other purpose than to feast his eyes with the death of his enemy and no apology which he could make for so exceptionable a circumstance of conduct could be accepted by the public the cruelty and animosity with which he urged on essexs fate even when cecil relented murdin p      were still regarded as the principles of this unmanly and ungenerous behavior  the earl of essex was but thirtyfour years of age when his rashness imprudence and violence brought him to this untimely end we must here as in many other instances lament the inconstancy of human nature that a person endowed with so many noble virtues generosity sincerity friendship valor eloquence and industry should in the latter period of his life have given such reins to his ungovernable passions as involved not only himself but many of his friends in utter ruin the queens tenderness and passion as it was the cause of those premature honors which he attained seems on the whole the chief circumstance which brought on his destruction confident of her partiality toward him as well as of his own merit he treated her with a haughtiness which neither her love nor her dignity could bear and as her amorous inclinations in so advanced an age would naturally make her appear ridiculous if not hateful in his eyes he was engaged by an imprudent openness of which he made profession to discover too easily those sentiments to her jealous pride the many reconciliations and returns of affection of which he had still made advantage made him venture on new provocations till he pushed her beyond all bounds of patience and he forgot that though the sentiments of the woman were ever strong in her those of the sovereign had still in the end appeared predominant  some of essexs associates cuffe davers blount meric and davis were tried and condemned and all of them except davis were executed the queen pardoned the rest being persuaded that they were drawn in merely from their friendship to that nobleman and their care of his safety and were ignorant of the more criminal part of his intentions southamptons life was spared with great difficulty but he was kept in prison during all the remainder of this reign  the king of scots who was apprehensive left his correspondence with essex might have been discovered and have given offense to elizabeth sent the earl of mar and the lord kinloss as ambassadors to england in order to congratulate the queen on her escape from the late insurrection and conspiracy they were also ordered to enquire whether any measures had been taken by her to exclude him from the succession as well as to discover the inclinations of the chief nobility and counselors in case of the queens demise birch memoirs vol ii p   0  they found the dispositions of men as favorable as they could wish and they even entered into a correspondence with secretary cecil whose influence after the fall of essex was now uncontrouled osborne p      and who was resolved by this policy to acquire in time the confidence of the successor he knew how jealous elizabeth ever was of her authority and he therefore carefully concealed from her his attachment to james but he afterward asserted that nothing could be more advantageous to her than this correspondence because the king of scots secure of mounting the throne by his undoubted title aided by those connexions with the english ministry was the less likely to give any disturbance to the present sovereign he also persuaded that prince to remain in quiet and patiently to expect that time should open to him the inheritance of the throne without pushing his friends on desperate enterprises which would totally incapacitate them from serving him jamess equity as well as his natural want of enterprise easily inclined him to embrace this resolution spotswood p          and thus the minds of the english were silently but universally disposed to admit without opposition the succession of the scottish line the death of essex by putting an end to faction had been rather favorable than prejudicial to that great event  the king of france who was little prepossessed in favor of james and who was averse to the union of england and scotland winwood vol i p      made his ambassador drop some hints to cecil of henrys willingness to concur in any measure for disappointing the hopes of the scotch monarch but as cecil showed an entire disapprobation of such schemes the court of france took no farther steps in that matter and thus the only foreign power which could give much disturbance to jamess succession was induced to acquiesce in it spotswood p      french affairs henry made a journey this summer to calais and the queen hearing of his intentions went to dover in hopes of having a personal interview with a monarch whom of all others she most loved and most respected the french king who felt the same sentiments toward her would gladly have accepted of the proposal but as many difficulties occurred it appeared necessary to lay aside by common consent the project of an interview elizabeth however wrote successively two letters to henry one by edmondes another by sir robert sydney in which she expressed a desire of conferring about a business of importance with some minister in whom that prince reposed entire confidence the marquess of rhoni the kings favorite and prime minister came to dover in disguise and the memoirs of that able statesman contain a full account of his conversation with elizabeth that magnanimous princess had formed a scheme of establishing in conjunction with henry a new system of policy in europe and of fixing a durable balance of power by the erection of new states on the ruins of the house of austria she had even the wisdom to foresee the perils which might ensue from the aggrandizement of her ally and she proposed to unite the whole seventeen provinces of the low countries into one republic in order to form a perpetual barrier against the dangerous increase of the french as well as of the spanish monarchy henry had himself long meditated such a project against the austrian family and rhoni could not forbear expressing his astonishment when he found that elizabeth and his master though they had never communicated their thoughts on this subject had not only entered into the same general views but had also formed the same project for their execution the affairs however of france were not yet brought to a situation which might enable henry to begin that great enterprise and rhoni satisfied the queen that it would be necessary to postpone for some years their united attack on the austrian family he departed filled with just admiration of the solidity of elizabeths judgment and the greatness of her mind and he owns that she was entirely worthy of that high reputation which she possessed in europe  the queens magnanimity in forming such extensive projects was the more remarkable that besides her having fallen so far into the decline of life the affairs of ireland though conducted with ability and success were still in disorder and made a great diversion of her forces the expense incurred by this war lay heavy upon her narrow revenues and her ministers taking advantage of her great disposition to frugality proposed to her an expedient of saving which though she at first disapproved of it she was at last induced to embrace it was represented to her that the great sums of money remitted to ireland for the pay of the english forces came by the necessary course of circulation into the hands of the rebels and enabled them to buy abroad all requisite supplies of arms and ammunition which from the extreme poverty of that kingdom and its want of every useful commodity they could not otherwise find means to purchase it was therefore proposed to her that she should pay her forces in money of a base alloy and it was asserted that besides the great saving to the revenue this species of coin could never be exported with advantage and would not pass in any foreign market some of the wiser counselors maintained that if the pay of the soldiers was raised in proportion the irish rebels would necessarily reap the same benefit from the base money which would always be taken at a rate suitable to its value if the pay was not raised there was danger of a mutiny among the troops who whatever names might be affixed to the pieces of metal would soon find from experience that they were defrauded in their income camden p    but elizabeth though she justly valued herself on fixing the standard of the english coin much debased by her predecessors and had innovated very little in that delicate article was seduced by the specious arguments employed by the lord treasurer on this occasion and she coined a great quantity of base money which she made use of in the pay of her forces in ireland  tom xvi p    mountjoys success in ireland mountjoy the deputy was a man of great ability and foreseeing the danger of mutiny among the troops he led them instantly into the field and resolved by means of strict discipline and by keeping them employed against the enemy to obviate those inconveniences which were justly apprehended he made military roads and built a fortress at moghery he drove the macgenises out of lecale he harrassed tyrone in ulster with inroads and lesser expeditions and by destroying every where and during all seasons the provisions of the irish he reduced them to perish with famine in the woods and morasses to which they were obliged to retreat at the same time sir henry docwray who commanded another body of troops took the castle of derry and put garrisons into newton and ainogh and having seized the monastery of donnegal near balishannon he threw troops into it and defended it against the assaults of odonnel and the irish nor was sir george carew idle in the province of munster he seized the titular earl of desmond and sent him over with florence macarty another chieftain prisoner to england he arrested many suspected persons and took hostages from others and having got a reinforcement of two thousand men from england he threw himself into cork which he supplied with arms and provisions and he put every thing in a condition for resisting the spanish invasion which was daily expected the deputy informed of the danger to which the southern provinces were exposed left the prosecution of the war against tyrone who was reduced to great extremity and he marched with his army into monster    d september at last the spaniards under don john daquila arrived at kingsale and sir richard piercy who commanded in the town with a small garrison of an hundred and fifty men sound himself obliged to abandon it on their appearance these invaders amounted to four thousand men and the irish expressed a great desire to join them in order to free themselves from the english government with which they were extremely discontented one chief ground of their complaint was the introduction of trials by jury camden p      an institution abhorred by this barbarous nation though nothing contributes more to the support of that equity and liberty for which the english laws are so justly celebrated the irish also bore a great favor to the spaniards having entertained the opinion that they themselves were descended from that nation and their attachment to the catholic religion proved a new cause of affection to the invaders daquila assumed the title of general in the holy war for the preservation of the faith in ireland and he endeavored to persuade the people that queen elizabeth was by several bulls of the pope deprived of her crown that her subjects were absolved from their oaths of allegiance and that the spaniards were come to deliver the irish from the power of the devil  p   defeat of the spaniards and irish mountjoy found it necessary to act with vigor in order to prevent a total insurrection of the irish and having gathered together his forces he formed the siege of kinsale by land while sir richard levison with a small squadron blockaded it by sea he had no sooner begun his operations than he heard of the arrival of another body of two thousand spaniards under the command of alphonso ocampo who had taken possession of baltimore and berehaven and he found himself obliged to detach sir george carew to oppose their progress tyrone meanwhile with randal mac surley tirel baron of killey and other chieftains of the irish had joined ocampo with all their forces and were marching to the relief of kinsale the deputy informed of their design by intercepted letters made preparations to receive them and being joined by levison with six hundred marines he posted his troops on an advantageous ground which lay on their passage leaving some cavalry to prevent a sally from daquila and the spanish garrison when tyrone with a body of irish and spaniards approached he was surprised to find the english so well posted and ranged in such good order and he immediately sounded a retreat but the deputy gave orders to pursue him and having thrown these advanced troops into disorder he followed them to the main body whom he also attacked and put to flight with the slaughter of twelve hundred men winwood vol i p    ocampo was taken prisoner tyrone fled into ulster odonel made his escape into spain and daquila finding himself reduced to the greatest difficulties was obliged to capitulate upon such terms as the deputy prescribed to him he surrendered kinsale and baltimore and agreed to evacuate the kingdom this great blow joined to other successes gained by wilmot governor of kerry and by roger and gavin harvey threw the rebels into dismay and gave a prospect of the final reduction of that kingdom  the irish war though successful was extremely burdensome on the queens revenue and besides the supplies granted by parliament which were indeed very small but which they ever regarded as mighty concessions she had been obliged notwithstanding her great frugality to employ other expedients such as selling the royal demesnes and crown jewels dewes p      and exacting loans from the people ibid  in order to support this cause so essential to the honor and interests of england  th october a parliament the necessity of her affairs obliged her again to summon a parliament and it here appeared that though old age was advancing fast upon her though she had lost much of her popularity by the unfortunate execution of essex insomuch that when she appeared in public she was not attended with the usual acclamations ibid p  0  osborne p  0   yet the powers of her prerogative supported by her vigor still remained as high and uncontrollable as ever  the active reign of elizabeth had enabled many persons to distinguish themselves in civil and military employments and the queen who was not able from her revenue to give them any rewards proportioned to their service had made use of an expedient which had been employed by her predecessors but which had never been carried to such an extreme as under her administration she granted her servants and courtiers patents for monopolies and these patents they sold to others who were thereby enabled to raise commodities to what price they pleased and who put invincible restraints upon all commerce industry and emulation it is astonishing to consider the number and importance of those commodities which were thus assigned over to patentees currants salt iron powder cards calfskins fells pouldavies oxshinbones train oil lists of cloth potashes anniseeds vinegar seacoals steel aquavitae brushes pots bottles saltpeter lead accidences oil calamintstone oil of blubber glasses paper starch tin sulphur new drapery dried pilchers transportation of iron ordnance of beer of horn of leather importation of spanish wools of irish yarn these are but a part of the commodities which had been consigned over to monopolists dewes p       0      when this list was read over in the house a member cried out is not bread in the number bread said every one with astonishment yes i assure you replied he if affairs go on at this rate we shall have bread reduced to a monopoly before next parliament ibid p      these monopolists were so exorbitant in their demands that in some places they raised the price of salt from sixteen pence a bushel to fourteen or fifteen shillings ibid p      such high profits naturally begot intruders upon their commerce and in order to secure themselves against encroachments the patentees were armed with high and arbitrary powers from the council by which they were enabled to oppress the people at pleasure and to exact money from such as they thought proper to accuse of interfering with their patent ibid p              the patentees of saltpeter having the power of entering into every house and of committing what havoc they pleased in stables cellars or wherever they suspected saltpeter might be gathered commonly extorted money from those who desired to free themselves of this damage or trouble dewes p      and while all domestic intercourse was thus restrained lest any scope should remain for industry almost every species of foreign commerce was confined to exclusive companies who bought and sold at any price that they themselves thought proper to offer or exact  these grievances the most intolerable for the present and the most pernicious in their consequences that ever were known in any age or under any government had been mentioned in the last parliament and a petition had even been presented to the queen complaining of the patents but she still persisted in defending her monopolists against her people a bill was now introduced into the lower house abolishing all these monopolies and as the former application had been unsuccessful a law was insisted on as the only certain expedient for correcting these abuses the courtiers on the other hand maintained that this matter regarded the prerogative and that they could never hope for success if they did not make application in the most humble and respectful manner to the queens goodness and beneficence the topics which were advanced in the house and which came equally from the courtiers and the country gentlemen and were admitted by both will appear the most extraordinary to such as are prepossessed with an idea of the ancient privileges of the people and of the liberty enjoyed under the administration of elizabeth it was asserted that the queen possessed both an enlarging and a restraining power by her prerogative she might set at liberty what was restrained by statute or otherwise and by her prerogative she might restrain what was otherwise at liberty ibid p         that the royal prerogative was not to be canvassed nor disputed nor examined ibid p      and did not even admit of any limitation ibid p          that absolute princes such as the sovereigns of england were a species of divinity ibid p      that it was in vain to attempt tying the queens hands by laws or statutes since by means of her dispensing power she could loosen herself at her pleasure ibid  that even if a clause should be annexed to a statute excluding her dispensing power she could first dispense with that clause and then with the statute ibid p       after all this discourse more worthy of a turkish divan than of an english house of commons according to our present idea of this assembly the queen who perceived how odious monopolies had become and what heats were likely to rise sent for the speaker and desired him to inform the house that she would immediately cancel the most grievous and oppressive of these patents it may not be amiss to subjoin some passages of these speeches which may serve very much to give us a just idea of the ancient constitution and of the political principles which prevailed during the reign of elizabeth mr laurence hyde proposed a bill entitled an act for the explanation of the common law in certain cases of letters patent mr spicer said this bill may touch the prerogativeroyal which as i learned the last parliament is so transcendant that the  of the subject may not aspire thereunto far be it therefore from me that the state and prerogativeroyal of the prince should be tied by me or by the act of any other subject mr francis bacon said as to the prerogativeroyal of the prince for my own part i ever allowed of it and it is such as i hope will never be discussed the queen as she is our sovereign has both an enlarging and restraining power for by her prerogative she may set at liberty things restrained by statute law or otherwise and secondly by her prerogative she may restrain things which be at liberty for the first she may grant a non obstante contrary to the penal laws  with regard to monopolies and such like cases the case has ever been to humble ourselves unto her majesty and by petition desire to have our grievances remedied especially when the remedy touches her so nigh in point of prerogative  i say and i say it again that we ought not to deal to judge or meddle with her majestys prerogative i wish therefore every man to be careful of this business dr bennet said he that goes about to debate her majestys prerogative had need to walk warily mr laurence hyde said for the bill itself i made it and i think i understand it and far be it from this heart of mine to think this tongue to speak or this hand to write any thing either in prejudice or derogation of her majestys prerogativeroyal and the state  mr speaker quoth sergeant harris for ought i see the house moves to have this bill in the nature of a petition it must then begin with more humiliation and truly sir the bill is good of itself but the penning of it is somewhat out of course mr montague said the matter is good and honest and i like this manner of proceeding by bill well enough in this matter the grievances are great and i would note only unto you thus much that the last parliament we proceeded by way of petition which had no successful effect mr francis more said i know the queens prerogative is a thing curious to be dealt withal yet all grievances are not comparable i cannot utter with my tongue or conceive with my heart the great grievances that the town and country for which i serve suffers by some of these monopolies it brings the general profit into a private hand and the end of all this is beggary and bondage to the subjects we have a law for the true and faithful currying of leather there is a patent sets all at liberty notwithstanding that statute and to what purpose is it to do any thing by act of parliament when the queen will undo the same by her prerogative out of the spirit of humiliation mr speaker i do speak it there is no act of here is that has been or is more derogatory to her own majesty more odious to the subject more dangerous to the commonwealth than the granting of these monopolies mr martin said i do speak for a town that grieves and pines for a country that groaneth and languisheth under the burden of monstrous and unconscionable substitutes to the monopolitans of starch tin fish cloth oil vinegar salt and i know not what nay what not the principalest commodities both of my town and country are engrost into the hands of these bloodsuckers of the commonwealth if a body mr speaker being let blood be left still languishing without any remedy how can the good estate of that body still remain such is the state of my town and country the traffic is taken away the inward and private commodities are taken away and dae not be used without the license of these monopolitans if these blood suckers be still let alone to suck up the best and principallest commodities which the earth there has given us what will become of us from whom the fruits of our own soil and the commodities of our own labor which with the sweat of our brows even up to the knees in mire and dirt we have labored for shall be taken by warrant of supreme authority which the poor subject dare not gainsay mr george moore said we know the power of her majesty cannot be restrained by any act why therefore should we thus talk admit we should make this statute with a non obstante yet the queen may grant a patent with a non obstante to cross this non obstante i think therefore it agrees more with the gravity and wisdom of this house to proceed with all humbleness by petition than bill mr downland said as i would be no let or overvehement in any thing so i am not sottish or senseless of the common grievance of the commonwealth if we proceed by way of petition we can have no more gracious answer than we had the last parliament to our petition but since that parliament we have no reformation sir robert wroth said i speak and i speak it boldly these patentees are worse than ever they were mr hayward townsend proposed that they should make suit to her majesty not only to repeal all monopolies grievous to the subject but also that it would please her majesty to give the parliament leave to make an act that they might be of no more force validity or effect than they are at the common law without the strength of her prerogative which though we might now do and the act being so reasonable we might assure ourselves her majesty would not delay the passing thereof yet we her loving subjects etc would not offer without her privity and consent the cause so nearly touching her prerogative or go about to do any such act  on a subsequent day the bill against monopolies was again introduced and mr spicer said it is to no purpose to offer to tie her majestys hands by act of parliament when she may loosen herself at her pleasure mr davies said god has given that power to absolute princes which he attributes to himself dixi quod dii estis n b this axiom he applies to the kings of england mr secretary cecil said i am servant to the queen and before i would speak and give consent to a case that should debase her prerogative or abridge it i would wish that my tongue were cut out of my head i am sure there were lawmakers before there were laws meaning i suppose that the sovereign wa above the laws one gentleman went about to posters us with the execution of the law man ancient record of   or   of edward the third likely enough to be true in that time when the king was afraid of the subject if you stand upon law and dispute of the prerogative he  what acon says prarogativam nostram ero  diffitre and for my own part i lie not these  should be taken and you mr speaker should perform the charge h majesty gave unto you in the beginning of this parliament not to receive bills of this nature for her majestys ears be open to all grievances and her hands stretched out to every mans petition  when the prince  penses with a penal law that is left to the alteration of sovereignity that is good and irrevocable mr montague said i am loath to speak what i know l perap i should displease the prerogative royal is that which is now in question and which the laws of the land have ever allowed and maintained let us therefore apply by petition to her majesty  after the speaker told the house that the queen had annulled many of the  mr franc moore said i must confess mr speaker i moved the house both the  parliament and this touching this point but i never meant and i hope the house thinks so to set limits and bounds to the prerogative royal he proceeds to move that thanks should be given to her majesty and tho the whereas diverse speeches have been moved extravagantly in the house which doubtless have been told her majesty and perhaps ill conceived of by her mr speaker would apologize and humbly crave pardon for the same n b these extracts were taken by townsend a member of the house who was no courtier and the extravagance of the speeches seems rather to be on the other side it will certainly appear odd to us that this liberty should be thought extravagant however the queen notwithstanding her cajoling the house was so ill satisfied with these proceedings that she spoke of them peevishly in her concluding speech and told them that she perceived that private respects with them were privately masqued under public presence dewes p      there were some other topics in favor of prerogative still more extravagant advanced in the house this parliament when the question of the subsidy was before them mr sergeant heyle said mr speaker i marvel much that the house should stand upon granting of a subsidy or the time of payment when all we have is her majestys and she may lawfully at her pleasure take it from us yea she has as much right to all our lands and goods as to any revenue of her crown at which all the house hemmed and laughed and talked well quoth sergeant heyle all your hemming shall not put me out of countenance so mr speaker stood up and said it is a great disorder that this should be used  so the said sergeant proceeded and when he had spoken a little while the house hemmed again and so he fat down in his latter speech he said he could prove his former position by precedents in the time of henry the third king john king stephen etc which was the occasion of their hemming dewes p     it is observable that heyle was an eminent lawyer a man of character winwood vol i p   0 and though the house in general showed their disapprobation no one cared to take him down or oppose these extravagant positions it was also asserted this session that in the same manner as the roman consul was possessed of the power of rejecting or admitting motions in the senate the speaker might either admit or reject bills in the house dewes p     the house declared themselves against this opinion but the very proposal of it is a proof at what a low ebb liberty was at that time in england  in the year      the judges made a solemn decree that england was an absolute empire of which the king was the head in consequence of this opinion they determined that even if the act of the first of elizabeth had never been made the king was supreme head of the church and might have erected by his prerogative such a court as the ecclesiastical commission for that he was the head of all his subjects now that court was plainly arbitrary the inference is that his power was equally absolute over the laity see cokes reports p   candreys case     the house was struck with astonishment and admiration and gratitude at this extraordinary instance of the queens goodness and condescension a member said with tears in his eyes that if a sentence of everlasting happiness had been pronounced in his favor he could not have felt more joy than that with which he was at present overwhelmed dewes p      another observed that this message from the sacred person of the queen was a kind of gospel or gladtidings and ought to be received as such and be written in the tablets of their hearts ibid p      and it was farther remarked that in the same manner as the deity would not give his glory to another so the queen herself was the only agent in their present prosperity and happiness ibid p      the house voted that the speaker with a certain number of members should ask permission to wait on her majesty and return her thanks for her gracious concessions to her people  when the speaker with the other members was introduced to the queen they all flung themselves on their knees and remained in that posture a considerable time till she thought proper to express her desire that they should rise the speaker displayed the gratitude of the commons that her sacred ears were ever open to hear them and her blessed hands ever stretched out to relieve them they acknowleged he said in all duty and thankfulness acknowleged that before they called her preventing grace and alldeserving goodness watched over them for their good more ready to give than they could desire much less deserve he remarked that the attribute which was most proper to god to perform all he promises appertained also to her and that she was all truth all constancy and all goodness and he concluded with these expressions neither do we present our thanks in words or any outward sign which can be no sufficient retribution for so great goodness but in all duty and thankfulness prostrate at your feet we present our most loyal and thankful hearts even the last drop of blood in our hearts and the last spirit of breath in our nostrils to be poured out to be breathed up for your safety dewe p       the queen heard very patiently this speech where she was flattered in phrases appropriated to the supreme being and she returned an answer full of such expressions of tenderness toward her people as ought to have appeared fulsome after the late instances of rigor which she had employed and from which nothing but necessity had made her depart thus was this critical affair happily terminated and elizabeth by prudently receding in time from her rights maintained her dignity and preserved the affections of her people  the commons granted her a supply very unprecedented of four subsidies and eight fifteenths and they were even so dutiful as to vote this supply before they received any satisfaction in the business of monopolies which they justly considered as of the utmost consequence to the interest and happiness of the nation had they attempted to extort that concession by keeping the supply in suspense so haughty was the queens disposition this appearance of constraint and jealousy had been sufficient to have produced a denial of all their requests and to have forced her into some acts of authority still more violent and arbitrary  monson p      they brought her home to england and she was valued at a million of ducats camden p      a sensible loss to the spaniards and a supply still more considerable to elizabeth this year the spaniards begun the siege of ostend which was bravely defended for five months by sir francis vere the states then relieved him by sending a new governor and on the whole the  three year and is computed to have cost the lives of an hundred thousand men   the affairs of ireland after the defeat of tyrone and the expulsion of the spaniards hastened to a settlement lord mountjoy divided his army into small parties and harrassed the rebels on every side he built charlemount and many other small forts which were impregnable to the irish and guarded all the important passes of the country the activity of sir henry docwray and sir arthur chichester permitted no repose or security to the rebels and many of the chiestains after skulking like wild beasts in woods and morasses submitted to mercy and received such conditions as the deputy was pleased to impose upon them tyrones submission tyrone himself made application by arthur macbaron his brother to be received upon terms but mountjoy would not admit him except he made an absolute surrender of his life and fortune to the queens mercy he appeared before the deputy at millefont in a habit and posture suitable to his present fortune and after acknowleging his offense in the most humble terms he was committed to custody by mountjoy who intended to bring him over captive into england to be disposed of at the queens pleasure  queens sickness but elizabeth was now incapable of receiving any satisfaction from this fortunate event she had fallen into a prosound melancholy which all the advantages of her high fortune all the glories of her prosperous reign were unable in any degree to alleviate or assuage some ascribed this depression of mind to her repentance of granting a pardon to tyrone whom she had always resolved to bring to condign punishment for his treasons but who had made such interest with the ministers as to extort a remission from her others with more likelihood accounted for her dejection by a discovery which she had made of the correspondence maintained in her court with her successor the king of scots and by the neglect to which on account of her old age and infirmities she imagined herself to be exposed but there is another cause assigned for her melancholy which has long been rejected by historians as remantic but which late discoveries seem to have confirmed see the proofs of this remarkable fact collected in births negociatious p  0  and memoir vol ii p      0   0 etc  some incidents happened which revived her tenderness for essex and filled her with the deepest sorrow for the consent which she had unwarily given to his execution  the earl of essex after his return from the fortunate expedition against cadiz observing the increase of the queens fond attachment toward him took occasion to regret that the necessity of her service required him often to be absent from her person and exposed him to all those ill offices which his enemies more assiduous in their attendance could practice against him she was moved with this tender jealousy and making him the present of a ring desired him to keep that pledge of her affection and assured him that in whatever disgrace he should fall whatever prejudices she might be induced to entertain against him yet if he sent her that ring she would immediately upon the sight of it recollect her former tenderness would afford him again a h aring and would lend a favorable ear to his apology essex notwithstanding all his misfortunes reserved this precious gift to the last extremity but after his trial and condemnation he resolved to try the experiment and he committed the ring to the countess of nottingham whom he desired to deliver it to the queen the countess was prevailed on by her husband who was essexs capital enemy not to execute the commission and elizabeth who still expected that her favorite would make this appeal to her tenderness and who ascribed the neglect of it to his invincible obstinacy was after much delay and many internal combats pushed by resentment and policy to sign the warrant for his execution the countess of nottingham falling into sickness and sinding herself approach toward her end was seized with remorse for her conduct and having obtained a visit from the queen she craved her pardon and revealed to her the fatal secret the queen astonished with this incident burst into a surious passion she shook the dying countess in her bed and crying to her that god might pardon her but she never ould she broke from her and thenceforth resigned herself over to the deepest and most incurable melancholy she rejected all consolation she even refused food and sustenance and throwing herself on the floor she kept herself silent and immovable feeding her thoughts on her afflictions and declaring life and existence an insufferable burden to her few words she uttered and they were all expressive of some inward grief which she cared not to reveal but sighs and groans were the chief vent which she gave to her despondency and which though they discovered her sorrows were able to ease or abate them ten days and nights she lay upon the carpet leaning on cushions which her maids brought her and her physicians could not persuade her to allow herself to be put to bed much less to make trial of any remedies which they prescribed to her strype vol iv no      her anxious mind at last had so long preyed on her frail body that her end was visibly approaching and the council being assembled sent the lord keeper the lord admiral and the secretary to know her mind with regard to her successor she answered with a faint voice that as she had held a regal scepter she desired no other than a royal successor cecil requesting her to explain herself more particularly she subjoined that she would have a king to succeed her and who should that be but her nearest kinsman the king of scots being then advised by the archbishop of canterbury to fix her thoughts upon god she replied that she did so nor did her mind in the least wander from him and death    march her voice soon after left her her senses failed she fell into a lethargic slumber which continued some hours and she expired gently without farther struggle or convulsion in the seventieth year of her age and fortyfifth of her reign  and character such a dark cloud overcast the evening of that day which had shone out with a mighty luster in the eyes of all europe there are few great personages in history who have been more exposed to the calumny of enemies and the adulation of friends than queen elizabeth and yet there scarce is any whose reputation has been more certainly determined by the unanimous consent of posterity the unusual length of her administration and the strong features of her character were able to overcome all prejudices and obliging her detractors to abate much of their invectives and her admirers somewhat of their panegyrics have at last in spite of political factions and what is more of religious animosities produced an uniform judgment with regard to her conduct her vigor her constancy her magnanimity her penetration vigilance address are allowed to merit the highest praises and appear not to have been surpassed by any person who ever filled a throne a conduct less rigorous less imperious more sincere more indulgent to her people would have been requisite to form a perfect character by the force of her mind she controuled all her more active and stronger qualities and prevented them from running into excess her heroism was exempt from all temerity her frugality from avarice her friendship from partiality her enterprise from turbulency and a vain ambition she guarded not herself with equal care or equal success from lesser infirmities the rivalship of beauty the desire of admiration the jealousy of love and the sallies of anger  her singular talents for government were founded equally on her temper and on her capacity endowed with a great command over herself she soon obtained an uncontrouled ascendant over her people and while she merited all their esteem by her real virtues she also engaged their affection by her pretended ones few sovereigns of england succeeded to the throne in more difficult circumstances and none ever conducted the government with such uniform success and felicity though unacquainted with the practice of toleration the true secret for managing religious factions she preserved her people by her superior prudence from those confusions in which theological controversy had involved all the neighboring nations and though her enemies were the most powerful princes of europe the most active the most enterprizing the least scrupulous she was able by her vigor to make deep impressions on their state her own greatness meanwhile remained untouched and unimpaired  the wise ministers and brave warriors who flourished during her reign share the praise of her success but instead of lessening the applause due to her they make great addition to it they owed all of them their advancement to her choice they were supported by her constancy and with all their ability they were never able to acquire any undue ascendant over her in her family in her court in her kingdom she remained equally mistress the force of the tender passions was great over her but the force of her mind was still superior and the combat which her victory visibly cost her serves only to display the firmness of her resolution and the loftiness of her ambitious sentiments  the fame of this princess though it has surmounted the prejudices both of faction and of bigotry yet lies still exposed to another prejudice which is more durable because more natural and which according to the different views in which we survey her is capable either of exalting beyond measure or diminishing the luster of her character this prejudice is founded on the consideration of her sex when we contemplate her as a woman we are apt to be struck with the highest admiration of her great qualities and extensive capacity but we are also apt to require some more softness of disposition some greater lenity of temper some of those amiable weaknesses by which her sex is distinguished but the true method of estimating her merit is to lay aside all these considerations and to consider her merely as a rational being placed in authority and entrusted with the government of mankind we may find it difficult to reconcile our fancy to her as a wife or a mistress but her qualities as a sovereign though with some considerable exceptions are the object of undisputed applause and approbation  government manners commerce arts and learning the party amongst us who have distinguished themselves by their adherence to liberty and a popular government have long indulged their prejudices against the succeeding race of princes by bestowing unbounded panegyrics on the virtue and wisdom of elizabeth they have even been so extremely ignorant of the transactions of this reign as to extol her for a quality which of all others she was the least possessed of a tender regard for the constitution and a concern for the liberties and privileges of her people but as it is scarce possible for the prepossessions of party to throw a veil much longer over facts so palpable and undeniable there is danger lest the public should run into the opposite extreme and should entertain an aversion to the memory of a princess who exercised the royal authority in a manner so much contrary to all the ideas which we at present entertain of a legal constitution but elizabeth only supported the prerogatives which were transmitted to her by her immediate predecessors she believed that her subjects were entitled to no more liberty than their ancestors enjoyed she found that they entirely acquiesced in her arbitrary administration and it was not natural for her to find fault with a form of government by which she herself was invested with such unlimited authority in the particular exertions of power the question ought never to be forgot what is best but in the general distribution of power among the several members of a constitution there can seldom be admitted any other question than what is usual few examples occur of princes who have willingly resigned their power none of those who have without struggle allowed it to be extorted from them if any other rule than ancient practice be followed factions and dissentions must multiply w thout end and though many constitutions and none more than the british have been improved even by violent innovations the praise which we bestow on those patriots to whom we are indebted for our privileges ought to be given with some reserve and surely without the least rancour against those who adhered to the ancient constitution  in order to understand the ancient constitution of england there is not a period which deserves more to be studied than the reign of elizabeth the prerogatives of this princess were scarce ever disputed and she therefore employed them without scruple her imperious temper a circumstance in which she went far beyond her successors rendered her exertions of power violent and frequent and discovered the full extent of her authority the great popularity which she enjoyed proves that the did not infringe any established liberties of the people there remain monuments numerous enough to as ertain the most noted acts of her administration and though thse monument must be sought remote from the ordinary historians they become only the more authenti on that account and serve as a stronger proof that the particular exertions of her power were conceived to be nothing but the ordinary course of administration since they were not thought remarkable enough to be recorded even by contemporary writers if there was any difference in this particular the people in former reigns seem rather to have been more submissive and servile than during the age of elizabeth in a memorial of the state of the realm  then follows the decay  which  and reverence of all inferior estate  person to behold the    it may not here be improper to recount some of the ancient prerogatives of the crown and lay open the sources of that great power which the english monarchs formerly enjoyed  one of the most ancient and most established instruments of power was the court of star chamber which possessed an unlimited discretionary authority of fining imprisoning and inflict ng corporal punishment and whose jurisdiction extended to all sorts of offenses contempts and disorders that lay not within reach of the common law the members of this court consisted of the privy council and the judges men who all of them enjoyed their offices during pleasure and when the prince himself was present he was the sole judge and all the others could only interpose with their advice there needed but this one court in any government to put an end to all regular legal and exact plans of liberty for who durst t himself in opposition to the crown and ministry or aspire to the character of being a patrn of freedom while exposed to so arbitrary a jurisdiction i much question whether any of the absolute monarchies in europe contain at present so illegal and despti a tribunal  the court of high commission was another jurisdiction still more terrible both because the crime of heresy of which it took coance wa more undesinable than any civil offense and beca se its methods of inquisition and of administering oaths were more contrary to all the m sip ideas of justice and equity the fines and imprisonments imposed by this court were frequent the deprivations and suspensions of the clergy for nonconformity were also very numerous and comprehended at one time the third of all the ecclesiastics of england neal vol i p      the queen in a letter to the archbishop of canterbury said expressly that she was resolved that no man should be suffered to decline either on the left or on the right hand from the drawn line limited by authority and by her laws and injunctions murden p       but martial law went far beyond even these two courts in a prompt and arbitrary and violent method of decision whenever there was any insurrection or public disorder the crown employed martial law and it was during that time exercised not only over the soldiers but over the whole people any one might be punished as a rebel or an aider and abettor of rebellion whom the provostmarshal or lieutenant of counties or their deputies pleased to suspect lord bacon says that the trial at common law granted the earl of essex and his fellow conspirators was a favor for that the case would have born and required the severity of martial law vol iv p   0  we have seen instances of its being employed by queen mary in defense of orthodoxy there remains a letter of queen elizabeths to the earl of suffex after the suppression of the northern rebellion in which she reproves him sharply because she had not heard of his having done any execution by martial law ms of lord roystons from the paper office  but the king of england did not always limit the exercise of martial law to the times of war and rebellion in      when there was no rebellion or insurrection king edward granted a commission of martial law and empowered the commissioners to execute it as should be thought by their discretions most necessary strypes eccles memoirs vol ii p          queen elizabeth too was not sparing in the use of martial law in      one peter burchet a puritan being persuaded that it was lawful or meritorious to kill such as opposed the truth of the gospel ran into the streets and wounded hawkins the famous seacaptain whom he took for hatton the queens favorite the queen was so incensed that she ordered him to be punished instantly by martial law but upon the remonstrance of some prudent counselors who told her that that law ought to be confined to turbulent times she recalled her order and delivered over burchet to the common law camden p     strype vol ii p      but she continued not always so reserved in exerting this authority there remains a proclamation of hers where she orders martial law to be used against all such as import bulls or even forbidden books and pamphlets from abroad strype vol iii p   0  and prohibits the lieutenants or their deputies to be questioned for their arbitrary punishment of such offenders any law or statute to the contrary in any wise notwithstanding we have another act of hers still more extraordinary the streets of london were very much infested with idle vagabonds and riotous persons the lord mayor had endeavored to repress this disorder the star chamber had exerted its authority and inflicted punishment on these rioters but the queen finding those remedies ineffectual revived martial law and gave sir thomas wilford a commission of provostmarshal granting him authority and commanding him upon signification given by the justices of peace in london or the neighboring counties of such offenders worthy to be speedily executed by martial law to attach and take the same persons and in the presence of the said justices according to justice of martial law to execute them upon the gallows or gibbet openly or near to such place where the said rebellious and incorrigible offenders shall be found to have committed the said great offenses rymer tom xvi p      i suppose it will be difficult to produce an instance of such an act of authority in any place nearer than muscovy  the star chamber and high commission and court martial though arbitrary jurisdictions yet had still some pretense of a trial at least a sentence but there was a grievous punishment very familiarly inflicted in that age without any other authority than the warrant of a secretary of state or of the privy council  to prison because they refused to pay the  p   and that was imprisonment in any jail and during any time that these ministers should think proper in suspicious times all the jails were full of prisoners of state and these unhappy victims of public jealousy were sometimes thrown into dungeons and loaded with irons and treated in the most cruel manner without any remedy from law  this practice was an indirect way of employing torture but the rak itself was frequently used upon any suspicion without other authority than a warrant from the secretary or the privy council even the council in the marches of wales were empowered by their very commission to make use of torture whenever they thought proper haynes p      there cannot be a stronger proof how lightly the rack was employed than the following story told by lord bacon we shall give it in his own words the queen was mightily incented against haywarde on account of a book he dedicated to lord essex being a story of the first year of king henry the fourth thinking it a seditious prelude to put into the peoples heads boldness and faction she said she had an opinion that there was treason in it and asked me if i could not find any places in it that might be drawn within the case of treason whereto i answered for treason sure i found none but for felony very many and when her majesty hastily asked me wherein i told her the author had committed very apparent theft for he had taken most of the sentences of cornelius tacitus and translated them into english and put them into his text and another time when the queen could not be persuaded that it was his writing whose name was to it but that it had some more mischievous author and said with great indignation that she would have him racked to produce his author i replied nay madam he is a doctor never rack his person but rack his style let him have pen ink and paper and help of books and be enjoined to continue the story where it breaks off and i will undertake by collating the styles to judge whether he were the author or no cabbala p     thus had it not been for bacons humanity or rather his wit this author a man of letters had been put to the rack for a most innocent performance his real offense was his dedicating a book to that munificent patron of the learned the earl of essex at a time when this nobleman lay under disgrace with her majesty  the queens menace of trying and punishing haywarde for treason could easily have been executed let his book have been ever so innocent while so many terrors hung over the peoples heads no jury durst have acquitted a man whom the court was resolved to have condemned the practice also of not confronting the witnesses with the prisoner gave the crown lawyers all imaginable advantages against him and indeed there occurs not one instance during all these reigns that the sovereign or the ministers were ever disappointed in the issue of a prosecution timid juries and judges who held their offices during pleasure never failed to second all the views of the court  the power of pressing and obliging any person to accept of any office was another prerogative totally incompatible with freedom osborne gives the following account of elizabeths method of employing this prerogative in case she sound any likely to interrupt her occasions says he she did seasonably prevent him by a chargeable employment abroad or putting him upon some service at home which she knew least grateful to the people contrary to a false maxim since practiced with far worse success by such princes as thought it better husbandry to buy off enemies than reward friends page   the practice with which osborne reproaches the two immediate successors of elizabeth proceeded partly from the extreme difficulty of their situation partly from the greater lenity of their disposition the power of pressing as may naturally be imagined was often abused and money was exacted by the officers for freeing persons from the service murden p       the government of england in that age bore some resemblance to that of turkey at present the sovereign possessed every power except that of imposing taxes and in both countries this limitation unsupported by other privileges appears rather prejudicial to the people in turkey it obliges the sultan to permit the extortion of the bashas and governors of provinces from whom he afterward squeezes presents or takes forfeitures in england it engaged the queen to erect monopolies and grant patents for exclusive trade an invention so pernicious that had she gone on during a tract of years at her own rate england the seat of riches arts and commerce would have contained at present as little industry as morocco or the coast of barbary  we may further observe that this valuable privilege valuable only because it proved afterward the means by which the parliament extorted all their other privileges was very much encroached on in an indirect manner during the reign of elizabeth as well as of her predecessors she often exacted loans from her people an arbitrary and unequal kind of imposition and which individuals felt severely for though the money had been regularly restored which was seldom the case bacon vol iv p      it lay in the princes hands without interest which was a sensible loss to the individuals from whom the money was borrowed  there remains a proposal made by the lord burleigh for levying a general loan on the people equivalent to a subsidy haynes p          a scheme which would have laid the burden more equally but which was in different words nothing but a taxation imposed without consent of parliament it is remarkable that the scheme thus proposed without any visible necessity by that wise minister is the very same which henry the eighth attempted and which charles the first enraged by ill usage from his parliament and reduced to the greatest difficulties put afterward in practice to the great discontent of the nation  the demand of benevolence was another invention of that age for taxing the people this practice was so little conceived to be irregular that the commons in      offered the queen a benevolence which she very generously refused as having no occasion at that time for money dewes p      queen mary also by an order of council increased the customs in some branches and her sister imitated the example bacon vol iv p      there was a species of ship money imposed at the time of the spanish invasion the several ports were required to equip a certain number of ships at their own charge and such was the alacrity of the people for the public defense that some of the ports particularly london sent double the number demanded of them monson p      when any levies were made for ireland france or the low countries the queen obliged the counties to raise the soldiers to arm and clothe them and carry them to the seaports at their own charge newyearsgifts were at that time expected from the nobility and from the more considerable gentry strypes memor vol i p       purveyance was another method of taxation unequal arbitrary and oppressive the whole kingdom felt sensibly the burden of this imposition and it was regarded as a great privilege which was conferred on oxford and cambridge to prohibit the purveyors from taking any commodities within five miles of these universities the queen victualled her navy by means of this prerogative during the first years of her government camden p       wardship was the most regular and legal of all these impositions by prerogative yet was it a great badge of slavery and oppressive to the great families when an estate fell to a female the sovereign obliged her to marry any one he pleased whether the heir was male or female the crown enjoyed the whole profit of the rents during the minority the giving a rich wardship was an usual method of rewarding a courtier or favorite  the inventions were endless which arbitrary power might employ for extorting of money while the people imagined that their property was secured by debarring the crown from imposing taxes strype has preserved a speech of lord burleigh to the queen and council wherein are contained some particulars not a little extraordinary annals vol iv p     and seq  burleigh proposes that she should erect a court for the correction of all abuses and should confer on the commissioners a general inquisitorial power over the whole kingdom he sets before her eyes the example of her wise grandfather henry the seventh who by such methods augmented extremely his revenue and he recommends that this new court should proceed as well by the direction and ordinary course of the laws as by virtue of her majestys supreme regiment and absolute power from whence law proceeded in a word he expects from this institution greater accession to the royal treasure than henry the eighth derived from the abolition of the abbeys and all the forfeitures of the ecclesiastical revenues this project of lord burleigh needs not i think any comment a form of government must be very arbitrary where a wise and good minister could make such a proposal to the sovereign  embargoes on merchandise was another engine of royal power by which the english princes were able to extort money from the people we have seen instances in the reign of mary elizabeth before her coronation issued an order to the customhouse prohibiting the sale of all crimson silks which should be imported till the court was first provided strype vol i p     she expected no doubt a good pennyworth from the merchants while they lay under this restraint  the parliament pretended to the right of enacting laws as well as of granting subsidies but this privilege was during that age still more insignificant than the other queen elizabeth expressly prohibited them from meddling with state matters or ecclesiastical causes and she openly sent the members to prison who dared to transgress her imperial edict in these particulars there passed few parliaments during her reign where there occur not instances of this arbitrary conduct  but the legislative power of the parliament was a mere fallacy while the sovereign was universally acknowleged to possess a dispensing power by which all the laws could be invalidated and rendered of no effect the use of this power was also an indirect method practiced for erecting monopolies where the statutes laid any branch of manufacture under restrictions the sovereign by exempting one person from the laws gave him in effect the monopoly of that commodity rymer tom w p  dewes      there was no grievance at that time more universally complained of than the frequent dispensing with the penal laws monson p    but in reality the crown possessed the full legislative power by means of proclamations which might affect any subject of the greatest importance and which the star chamber took care to see more rigorously executed than the laws themselves the motives of these proclamations were sometimes very ridiculous queen elizabeth had taken offense at the smell of woad and she issued an edict prohibiting any one to cultivate that useful plant townsends journal p  0 stows annals  she was also pleased to take offense at the long swords and high ruffs then in fashion she sent about  officers to break every mans sword and clip every mans ruff which was beyond a certain length townsends journal p  0 stows annals strype vol ii p    this practice resembles somewhat the method employed by the great czar peter to make his subjects change their garb  the queens prohibition of the prophesyings was founded on a better reason but shows still the unlimited extent of her prerogative two or three people could not meet together in order to read the scriptures and confer about religion though in ever so orthodox a manner without her permission  there were many other branches of prerogative incompatible with an exact or regular enjoyment of liberty none of the nobility could marry without permission from the sovereign the queen detained the earl of southampton long in prison because he privately married the earl of essexs cousin birchs memoirs vol ii p      no man could travel without the consent of the prince sir william evers underwent a severe persecution because he had presumed to pay a private visit to the king of scots ibid p       the parliament in the thirteenth of the queen praised her for not imitating the practice usual among her predecessors of stopping the course of justice by particular warrants dewes p      there could not possibly be a greater abuse nor a stronger mark of arbitrary power and the queen in refraining from it was very laudable but she was by no means constant in this reserve there remain in the public records some warrants of here is for exempting persons from all lawsuits and prosecutions rymer tom xv p      0       and these warrants she says she grants from her royal prerogative which she will not allow to be disputed  it is easy to imagine that in such a government no justice could by course of law be obtained of the sovereign unless he was willing to allow it in the naval expedition undertaken by raleigh and forbisher against the spaniards in      a very rich carrack was taken worth two hundred thousand pounds the queens share in the adventure was only a tenth part but as the prize was so great and exceeded so much the expectations of all the adventurers she was determined not to rest contented with her share raleigh humbly and earnestly begged her to accept of an hundred thousand pounds in lieu of all demands or rather exactions and says that the present which the proprietors were willing to make her of eighty thousand pounds was the greatest that ever a prince received from a subject strype vol iv p           but it is no wonder the queen in her administration should pay so little regard to liberty while the parliament itself in enacting laws were so entirely negligent of it the persecuting statutes which they passed against papists and puritans are extremely contrary to the genius of freedom and by exposing such multitudes to the tyranny of priests and bigots accustomed the people to the most disgraceful subjection their conferring an unlimited supremacy on the queen or what is worse acknowleging her inherent right to it was another proof of their voluntary servitude  the law of the   d of her reign making seditious words against the queen capital is another very tyrannical statute and an use no less tyrannical was sometimes made of it the case of udal a puritannical clergyman seems singular even in those arbitrary times this man had published a book called a demonstration of discipline in which he inveighed against the government of bishops and though he had carefully endeavored to conceal his name he was thrown into prison upon suspicion and brought to his trial for this offense it was pretended that the bishops were part of the queens political body and to speak against them was really to attack her and was therefore felony by the statute this was not the only iniquity to which udal was exposed the judges would not allow the jury to determine any thing but the fact whether udal had wrote the book or not without examining his intention or the import of the words in order to prove the fact the crown lawyers did not produce a single witness to the court they only read the testimony of two persons absent one of which said that udal had told him he was the author another that a friend of udals had said so they would not allow udal to produce any exculpatory evidence which they said was never to be permitted against the queen and they tendered him an oath by which he was required to swear that he was not author of the book and his refusal to give that testimony was employed as the strongest proof of his guilt it is almost needless to add that notwithstanding these multiplied iniquities a verdict of death was given by the jury against udal for as the queen was extremely bent upon his prosecution it was impossible he could escape state trials vol i p     strype vol iv p    id life of whitgift p      he died in prison before the execution of the sentence  the case of penry was if possible still harder this man was a zealous puritan or rather a brownist and he had wrote against the hierarchy several tracts such as martin marprelate theses martinianae and other compositions full of low scurrility and petulant satyr after concealing himself for some years he was seized and as the statute against seditious words required that the criminal should be tried within a year after committing the offense he could not be indicted for his printed books he was therefore tried for some papers found in his pocket as if he had thereby scattered sedition strypes life of whitgift book iv chap ii neal vol i p      it was also imputed to him by the lord keeper puckering that in some of these papers he had only acknowleged her majestys royal power to establish laws ecclesiastical and civil but had avoided the usual terms of making enacting decreeing and ordaining laws which imply says the lord keeper a most absolute authority strype vol iv p      penry for these offenses was condemned and executed  thus we have seen that the most absolute authority of the sovereign to make use of the lord keepers phrase was established on above twenty branches of prerogative which are now abolished and which were every one of them totally incompatible with the liberty of the subject but what ensured more effectually the slavery of the people than even these branches of prerogative was the established principles of the times which attributed to the prince such an absolute and indefeizable authority as was supposed to be the origin of all law and could be bound and circumscribed by none the homilies published for the use of the clergy and which they were enjoined to read every sunday in all the churches inculcate every where a blind and unlimited passiveobedience to the prince which on no account and under no pretense is it ever lawful for them in the smallest article to depart from or infringe much noise has been made because some court chaplains during the succeeding reigns were permitted to preach such doctrines but there is a great difference between these sermons and discourses published by authority avowed by the prince and council and promulgated to the whole nation gifford a clergyman was suspended in      for preaching up a limited obedience to the civil magistrate neal vol i p      so thoroughly were these principles imbibed by the people during the reigns of elizabeth and her predecessors that opposition to them was regarded as the most flagrant sedition and was not even rewarded by that public praise and approbation which can alone support men under such dangers and difficulties as attend the resistance of tyrannical authority it was only during the next generation that the noble principles of liberty took root and spreading themselves under the shelter of puritannical absurdities became fashionable among the people  it is worth remarking that the advantage usually ascribed to absolute monarchy a greater regularity of police and a more strict execution of the laws did not attend the ancient english government though in many respects it fell under that denomination a demonstration of this truth is contained in a judicious paper which is preserved by strype annals vol iv p   0 and seq  and which was wrote by an eminent justice of peace of somersetshire in the year      near the end of the queens reign when the authority of that princess may be supposed to be fully corroborated by time and her maxims of government improved by long practice this paper contains an account of the disorders which then prevailed in the county of somerset the author says that forty persons had been there executed in a year for robberies thefts and other felonies thirtyfive burnt in the hand thirtyseven whipped one hundred and eightythree discharged that those who were discharged were most wicked and desperate persons who never could come to any good because they would not work and none would take them into service that notwithstanding this great number of indictments the fifth part of the felonies committed in the county were not brought to a trial the greater number escaped censure either from the superior cunning of the selons the remissness of the magistrates or the foolish lenity of the people that the rapines committed by the infinite number of wicked wandering idle people were intolerable to the poor countrymen and obliged them to a perpetual watch of their sheepfolds their pastures their woods and their cornfieldsd that the other counties of england were in no better condition than somersetshire and many of them were even in a worse that there were at least three or four hundred ablebodied vagabonds in every county who lived by theft and rapine and who sometimes met in troops to the number of sixty and committed spoil on the inhabitants that if all the felons of this kind were assembled they would be able if reduced to good subjection to give the greatest enemy her majesty has a strong battle and that the magistrates themselves were intimidated from executing justice upon them and there were examples of justices of peace who after giving sentence against rogues had interposed to stop the execution of their own sentence for fear of the danger which hung over them from the confederates of these felons  in the year      the queen complained in parliament of the bad execution of the laws and threatened if the magistrates were not for the future more vigilant that she would entrust authority to indigent and needy persons who would find an interest in the more exact distribution of justice dewes p     it appears that she was as good as her word for in   0  there were great complaints made in parliament of the rapine of justices of peace and a member said that this magistrate was an animal who for half a dozen of chickens would pense with a dozen of penal statutes ibid p         it is not easy to account for this relaxation of government and neglect of police during a reign of so much  as that of elizabeth the small revenue of the crown is the most likely cause that can be assigned the queen had it not in her power to interest a great number in assisting her to execute the laws  on the whole the english have no reason from the example of their ancestors to be in love with the picture of absolute monarchy or to prefer the unlimited authority of the prince and his unbounded prerogatives to that noble liberty that sweet equality and that happy security by which they are at present distinguished above all nations of the universe the utmost that can be said in favor of the ancient government and perhaps it may be said with truth is that the power of the prince though really unlimited was exercised after the european manner and entered not into every part of the administration that the instances of a high exerted prerogative were not so frequent as to render property sensibly insecure or reduce the people to a total servitude that the freedom from faction the quickness of execution and the promptitude of those measures which could be taken for offense or defense made some compensation for the want of a legal and determined liberty that as the prince commanded no mercenary army there was a tacit check on him which maintained the government in that medium to which the people had been accustomed and that this situation of england was in reality more remote though seemingly it approached nearer a despotic and eastern monarchy than the present government of that kingdom where the people though guarded by multiplied laws are totally naked defenseless and disarmed  we shall close this volume with a brief account of the revenues the military force the commerce the arts and the learning of england during this period  queen elizabeths economy was very remarkable and in some instances seemed to border on avarice the smallest expense if it could possibly be saved appeared considerable in her eyes and even the charge of an express during the most delicate transactions was not below her notice birchs negot p     she was also attentive to every profit and embraced opportunities of gain which may appear somewhat extraordinary she kept the sea of ely vacant nineteen years in order to pocket the revenue strype vol iv p      and it was usual with her when she promoted a bishop to take the opportunity of pillaging the sea of some of its manors ibid p      but that there was in reality little or no avarice in the queens temper appears from this circumstance that she never amassed any treasure and even refused subsidies from the parliament when she had no present occasion for them yet we must not conclude from this circumstance that her economy proceeded from a tender concern for her people she loaded them with monopolies and exclusive patents which are infinitely more oppressive than the most heavy taxes levied in a legal and regular manner the real source of her frugal conduct was derived from her desire of independency and her care to preserve her dignity which would have been endangered had she reduced herself to the necessity of having frequent recourse to parliamentary supplies in consequence of this motive the queen though engaged in successful and necessary wars thought it more prudent to make a continual dilapidation of the royal demesnes rymer tom xvi p     dewes p                 bacon vol iv p      than demand the most moderate supplies from the commons as she lived unmarried and had no posterity she was contented to serve her present turn though at the expense of her successors who by reason of this policy joined to other accidents found themselves on a sudden reduced to the most extreme indigence  the splendour of a court was during this age a great part of the public charge and as elizabeth was a single woman and expensive in no species of magnificence except clothes this circumstance enabled her to perform great things by her narrow revenue she is said to have paid four millions of debt left on the crown by her father brother and sister an incredible sum for that age dewes p     i think it impossible to reconcile this account of the public debts with that given by strype eccles mem vol ii p     that in the year      the crown owed but  00000 pounds i own that this last sum appears a great deal more likely the whole revenue of queen elizabeth would not in ten years have paid four millions  the states at the time of her death owed her about eight hundred thousand pounds and the king of france four hundred and fifty thousand winwood vol i p        though that prince was extremely frugal and after the peace of vervins was continually amassing treasure the queen never could by the most pressing remonstrances prevail on him to make payment of those sums which she had so generously advanced him during his greatest distresses one payment of twenty thousand crowns and another of fifty thousand were all she could obtain by the strongest representations she could make of the difficulties to which the rebellion in ireland had reduced her ibid p          the queen expended on the wars with spain between      and      the sum of one million three hundred thousand pounds beside the double subsidy amounting to two hundred and eighty thousand pounds granted her by parliament dewes p      in the year      she spent six hundred thousand pounds in six months in the service of ireland camden p      sir robert cecil affirmed that in ten years time ireland cost her three millions four hundred thousand pounds appendix to the earl of essexs apology  she gave the earl of essex a present of thirty thousand pounds upon his departure for the government of that kingdom birchs memoirs vol ii  lord burleigh computed that the value of the gifts conferred on that favorite amounted to three hundred thousand pounds a proof of her strong affection toward him it was a common saying during this reign the queen pays bountifully though she rewards sparingly nantons regalia chap i   it is difficult to compute exactly the queens ordinary revenue but it certainly fell much short of five hundred thousand pounds a year in    0 she raised the customs from fourteen thousand pounds a year to fifty thousand pounds and obliged sir thomas smith who had farmed them to refund some of his former profits camden p     this account of camden is difficult or impossible to be reconciled to the state of the customs in the beginning of the subsequent reign as they appear in the journals of the commons see hist of great britain vol i chap    this improvement of the revenue was owing to the suggestions of one caermarden and was extremely opposed by burleigh leicester and walsingham but the queens preseverance overcame all their opposition the great undertakings which she executed with so narrow a revenue and with such small supplies from her people prove the mighty effects of wisdom and economy she received from the parliament during the course of her whole reign only twenty subsidies and thirtynine fifteenths it is not easy to compute exactly the amount of these supplies because the value of a subsidy was continually falling and in the end of her reign it amounted only to eighty thousand pounds dewes p   0  which in the beginning had been an hundred and twenty thousand if we suppose that the whole supplies granted elizabeth during a reign of fortyfive years amounted to three millions we shall not probably be much wide of the truth this sum makes only sixtysix thousand six hundred and sixtysix pounds a year and it is surprising that while the queens demands were so moderate and her expenses so well regulated she should ever have found any difficulty of getting a supply from the parliament or be reduced to make sale of the crown lands but such was the extreme i had almost said absurd parsimony of the parliaments during that period they valued nothing in comparison of their money the members had no connection with the court and the very idea which they conceived of the trust committed to them was to reduce the demands of the crown and to grant as few supplies as possible the crown on the other hand conceived the parliament in no other light than a means of supply queen elizabeth made a merit to her people of seldom assembling parliaments strype vol iv p      no redress of grievances was expected from these assemblies they were supposed to meet for no other purpose than to impose taxes  before queen elizabeths reign the english princes had always recourse to the city of antwerp for voluntary loans and their credit was so low that besides the exorbitant interest of ten or twelve per cent they were obliged to make the city of london join in the security sir thomas gresham that great and enterprizing merchant one of the chief ornaments of this reign engaged the company of merchantadventurers to grant a loan to the queen and as the money was regularly paid her credit by degrees established itself in the city and she shook off this dependence on foreigners stowes survey of london book i p       in      the queen employed gresham to borrow for her two hundred thousand pounds at antwerp in order to enable her to reform the coinage which was at that time extremely debased ms of lord roystons from the paper office p     she was so unpolitic as to make herself an innovation in the coin by dividing a pound of silver into sixtytwo shillings instead of sixty the former standard this is the last time that the coin has been tampered with in england  queen elizabeth sensible how much the defense of her kingdom depended on its naval power was desirous to encourage commerce and navigation but as her monopolies tended to extinguish all domestic industry which is much more valuable than foreign trade and is the foundation of it the general train of her conduct was very ill calculated to serve the purpose at which she aimed much less to promote the riches of her people the exclusive companies also were an immediate check on foreign trade yet notwithstanding these discouragements the spirit of the age was strongly bent on naval enterprises and besides the military expeditions against the spaniards many attempts were made for new discoveries and many new branches of foreign commerce were opened by the english sir martin forbisher undertook three fruitless voyages to discover the northwest passage davis not disheartened by this ill success made a new attempt when he discovered the straits which pass by his name in   00 the queen granted the first patent to the east india company the stock of that company was seventytwo thousand pounds and they fitted out four ships under the command of james lancaster for this new branch of trade the adventure was successful and the ships returning with a rich cargo encouraged the company to continue that commerce  the communication with muscovy had been opened in queen marys time by the discovery of the passage to archangel but the commerce to that country began not to be carried to a great extent till about the year     the queen obtained from the czar an exclusive patent to the english for the whole trade to muscovy camden p  0   and she entered into a personal as well as national alliance with him this czar was named john basilides a most furious tyrant who suspecting continually the revolt of his subjects stipulated a safe retreat and protection in england in order the better to ensure himself of this resource he proposed to marry an english woman and the queen intended to have sent him the lady anne hastings daughter to the earl of huntingdon but when the lady was informed of the barbarous manners of the country she wisely declined purchasing an empire at the expense of her ease and safety ibid p       the english encouraged by the privileges which they had obtained from basilides ventured farther into these countries than any europeans had formerly done they transported their goods along the river dwina in boats made of one entire tree which they towed and rowed up the stream as far as walogda from thence they carried them seven days journey by land to yerastau and then down the volga to astracan at astracan they built ships crossed the caspian sea and distributed their commodities into persia but this bold attempt met with such discouragements that it was never renewed ibid p       after the death of john basilides his son theodore revoked the patent which the english enjoyed for a monopoly of the russian trade and when the queen remonstrated against this innovation he told her ministers that princes must carry an indifferent hand as well between their subjects as between foreigners and not convert trade which by the laws of nations ought to be common to all into a monopoly for the private gain of a few ibid p      so much juster notions of commerce were entertained by this barbarian than were practiced by the renowned queen elizabeth theodore however continued some privileges to the english on account of their being the first discoverers of the communication between europe and his country  the trade to turkey was begun about      and that commerce was immediately confined to a company by queen elizabeth before that time the grand signior had always conceived england to be a dependant province of france birchs memoirs vol i p     but having heard of the queens power and reputation he gave a good reception to the english and even granted them larger privileges than he had given to the french  the merchants of the hansetowns complained loudly in the beginning of elizabeths reign of the treatment which they had received in the days of king edward and queen mary she very prudently replied that as she would not innovate any thing she would protect them still in the immunities and privileges which she found them possessed of this answer not contenting them their commerce was soon after suspended for a time to the great advantage of the english merchants who tried what they could themselves effectuate for the promotion of their commerce they took the whole trade into their own hands and their returns proving successful they divided themselves into staplers and merchantadventurers the former residing constantly at one place the other trying their fortunes in other towns and states abroad with cloth and other manufactures this success so enraged the hansetowns that they tried all the methods which a discontented people could devise to draw upon the english merchants the ill opinion of other nations and states they prevailed so far as to obtain an imperial edict by which the english merchants were prohibited all commerce in the empire the queen by way of retaliation retained sixty of their ships which had been seized in the river of lisbon with contraband goods of the spaniards these ships the queen intended to have restored as desiring to have compromised all differences with those trading cities but when she was informed that a general assembly was held at lubec in order to concert measures for distressing the english trade she caused the ships and cargoes to be confiscated only two of them were released to carry home the news and to inform these states that she had the greatest contempt imaginable for all their proceedings lives of the admirals vol i p   0   henry the eighth in order to fit out a navy was obliged to hire ships from hamburg lubec dantzick genoa and venice but elizabeth very early in her reign put affairs upon a better footing both by building some ships of her own and by encouraging the merchants to build large trading vessels which on occasion were converted into ships of war camden p      in      the seamen in england were computed at fourteen thousand two hundred and ninetyfive men monson p   0  the number of vessels twelve hundred and thirtytwo of which there were only two hundred and seventeen above eighty tons monson computes that though the navigation decayed in the first years of james the first by the practice of the merchants who carried on their trade in foreign bottoms ibid p  00  yet before    0 this number of seamen was trebled in england ibid p   0       the navy which the queen left at her decease appears considerable when we consider only the number of vessels which were fortytwo but when we reflect that none of these ships carried above forty guns that four only came up to that number that there were but two ships of a thousand ton and twentythree below five hundred some of fifty and some even of twenty tons that the whole number of the guns belonging to the fleet were seven hundred and seventyfour monson p     the english navy at present carries about   000 guns  we must entertain a very contemptible idea of the english navy compared to the force which it has now attained in the year      there were not above five vessels equipped by the noblemen and seaports which exceeded two hundred tons ibid p  00   in      an alarm was given of an invasion from the spaniards and the queen equipped a fleet and levied an army in a fortnight to oppose them nothing gave foreigners a higher idea of the power of england than this sudden armament in      all the militia in the kingdom were computed at an hundred and eightytwo thousand nine hundred and twentynine ives of the admiral vol i p      a distribution was made in      of an hundred and forty thousand men besides those which wales could supply strype vol iv p      these armies were formidable by their numbers but their discipline and experience were not proportioned small bodies from dunkirk and newport frequently ran over and plundered the east coast so unfit was the militia as it was then constituted for the defense of the kingdom the lord lieutenants were first appointed to the counties in this reign  mr murden p  0  has published a paper which contains the military force of the nation at the time of the spanish armada and which is somewhat different from the account given by our ordinary historians it makes the whole ablebodied men of the kingdom amount to an hundred and eleven thousand five hundred and thirteen those armed to eighty thousand eight hundred and seventyfive of whom forty four thousand seven hundred and twentyseven were trained it must be supposed that these ablebodied men consisted of such only as were registered otherwise the small number is not to be accounted for  the state of the english manufactures was at this time very low and foreign wares of almost all kinds had the preference  p 0   about    0 there were in london four persons only rated in the subsidybooks so high as four hundred pounds ibid p  0   this computation is not indeed to be esteemed an exact estimate of their wealth in      there were found on enquiry to be four thousand eight hundred and fiftyone strangers of all nations in london of whom three thousand eight hundred and thirtyeight were flemish and only fiftyeight scotch haynes p          the persecut ons in france and the low countries drove afterward a greater number of foreigners into england and the commerce as well as manufactures of that kingdom was very much improved by them stowe p      it was then that sir thomas gresham built at his own charge the magnificent fabric of the exchange for the reception of the merchants the queen visited it and gave it the appellation of the royal exchange  there were two attempts made in this reign to settle colonies in america one by sir humphry gilbert in newfoundland another by sir walter raleigh in virginia but neither of these projects proved successful all these noble settlements were made in the following reigns the current money of the kingdom in the end of this reign is computed at four millions lives of the admirals vol i p       the nobility in this age supported a great deal of the ancient magnificence in their hospitality and in the numbers of their retainers and the queen found it prudent to retrench by proclamation their expenses in this last particular strype vol iii appen p     the expense of hospitality she somewhat encouraged by the frequent visits she paid her nobility and the magnificent feasts which she received from them the earl of leicester gave her an entertainment in kenibworth castle which was extraordinary for expense and magnificence among other particulars we are told that three hundred and sixtyfive hogsheads of beer were drank at it biogr brit vol iii p       the earl had fortified this castle at great expense and it contained arms for ten thousand men strype vol iii p      the earl of derby had a family consisting of two hundred and forty servants stowe p      stowe remarks it as a singular proof of beneficence in this nobleman that he was contented with his rent from his tenants and exacted not any extraordinary services from them a proof that the absolute power of the sovereign what was unavoidable had very generally countenanced the nobility in tyrannizing over the people burleigh though he was frugal and had no paternal estate kept a family consisting of an hundred servants strype vol iii p     appen  he had a standing table for gentlemen and two other tables for persons of meaner condition which were always served alike whether he were in town or in the country about his person he had people of great distinction insomuch that he could reckon up twenty gentlemen retainers who had each a thousand pounds a year and as many among his ordinary servants who were worth from a thousand pounds to three five ten and twenty thousand pounds biogr brit p       it is to be remarked that though the revenue of the crown was at that time very small the ministers and courtiers found means by employing the exorbitant prerogative to acquire much greater fortunes than it is possible for them at present to gain from their larger salaries and more limited authority  but though there were preserved great remains of the ancient customs the nobility were by degrees acquiring a taste of elegant luxury and many edifices in particular were built by them neat large and sumptuous to the great ornament of the kingdom says camden page      but to the no less decay of the glorious hospitality of the nation it is however more reasonable to think that this new turn of expense promoted arts and industry while the ancient hospitality was the source of vice disorder sedition and idleness  among the other species of luxury that of apparel began much to increase during this age and the queen thought proper to restrain it by proclamation camden p      her example was very little conformable to her edicts as no woman was ever more conceited of her beauty nor more desirous of making impression on the hearts of beholders no one ever went to a greater extravagance in apparel or studied more the variety and richness of her dress she appeared almost every day in a different habit and tried all the several modes by which she hoped to render herself agreeable she was also so fond of her clothes that she never could part with any of them and at her death she had in her wardrobe all the different habits to the number of three thousand which she had ever worn in her lifetime carte vol iii p  0  from beaumonts dispatches   the retrenchment of the ancient hospitality and the diminution of retainers were favorable to the prerogative of the sovereign and by disabling the great noblemen from resistance promoted the execution of the laws and extended the authority of the courts of justice there were many particular causes in the situation and character of henry the seventh which augmented the authority of the crown most of these causes concurred in succeeding princes together with the factions of religion and the acquisition of the supremacy a most important article of prerogative but the manners of the age were a general cause which operated during this whole period and which continually tended to diminish the riches and still more the influence of the aristocracy anciently so formidable to the crown the habits of luxury dissipated the immense fortunes of the ancient barons and as the new methods of expense gave subsistence to mechanics and merchants who lived in an independent manner on the fruits of their own industry a nobleman instead of that unlimited ascendant which he was wont to assume over those who were maintained at his board or subsisted by salaries conferred on them retained only that moderate influence which customers have over tradesmen and which can never be dangerous to civil government the landproprietors also having a greater demand for money than for men endeavored to turn their lands to the best account with regard to profit and either enclosing their fields or joining many small farms into a few large ones discharged those useless hands which formerly were always at their call in every attempt to subvert the government or oppose a neighboring baron by all these means the cities increased the middle rank of men began to be rich and powerful the prince who in effect was the same with the law was implicitly obeyed and though the farther progress of the same causes begot a new plan of liberty founded on the privileges of the commons yet in the interval between the fall of the nobles and the rise of this order the sovereign took advantage of the present situation and assumed an authority almost absolute  whatever may be commonly imagined from the authority of lord bacon and from that of harrington and later authors the laws of henry the seventh contributed very little toward the great revolutions which happened about this period in the english constitution the practice of breaking entails by a fine and recovery had been introduced in the preceding reigns and this prince only gave indirectly a legal sanction to the practice by reforming some abuses which attended it but the settled authority which he acquired to the crown enabled the sovereign to encroach on the separate jurisdictions of the barons and produced a more general and regular execution of the laws the counties palatine underwent the same fate as the feudal jurisdictions and by a statute of henry the eighth  hon viii c     the jurisdiction of these counties was annexed to the crown and all writs were ordained to run in the kings name but the change of manners was the chief cause of the secret revolution of the government and subverted the power of the barons  learning on its first revival was held in great estimation by the english princes and nobles and as it was not yet prostituted by being too common even the great deemed it an object of ambition to attain a character for literature the four successive sovereigns henry edward mary and elizabeth may on one account or other be admitted into the class of authors queen catherine parr translated a book lady jane gray considering her age and her sex and her station may be regarded as a prodigy of literature sir thomas smith was raised from being professor in cambridge first to be ambassador to france and then secretary of state the dispatches of those times and among others those of burleigh himself are very frequently interlarded with quotations from the greek and latin classics even the ladies of the court valued themselves on knowledge lady burleigh lady bacon and their two sisters were mistresses of the ancient as well as modern languages and valued themselves more on their eurdition than on their rank and quality  queen elizabeth wrote and translated several books and she was familiarly acquainted with the greek as well as latin tongue it is pretended that she made an extemporary reply in greek to the university of cambridge who had addressed her in that language it is certain that she answered in latin without preparation and in a very spirited manner to the polish ambassador who had been wanting in respect to her when she had finished she turned about to her courtiers and said gods death my lords for she was much addicted to swearing i have been forced this day to scour up my old latin that has long lain rusting speed  elizabeth even after she was queen did not entirely drop the ambition of appearing as an author and next to her desire of admiration for beauty this seems to have been the chief object of her vanity she translated boethius of the consolation of philosophy in order as she pretended to allay her grief for henry the fourths change of religion as far as we can judge from elizabeths compositions we may pronounce that notwithstanding her application and her excellent parts her taste in literature was very indifferent she was much inferior to her successor in this particular who was himself far from being a just model of eloquence  unhappily for literature at least for the learned of this age the queens vanity lay more in shining by her own learning than in encouraging men of genius by her liberality spencer himself the finest english writer of his age was long neglected and after the death of sir philip sydney his patron was allowed to die almost for want this poet contains great beauties a sweet and harmonious versification easy elocution a fine imagination yet does the perusal of his work become so tedious that one never finishes it from the mere pleasure which it affords it soon becomes a kind of taskreading and it requires some essort and resolution to carry us on to the end of his long performance this effect of which every one is conscious is usually ascribed to the change of manners but manners have more changed since homers age and yet that poet remains still the favorite of every reader of taste and judgment homer copied true natural manners which however rough or uncultivated will always form an agreeable and interesting picture but the pencil of the english poet was employed in drawing the affectations and conceits and fopperies of chivalry which appear ridiculous as soon as they lose the recommendation of the mode the tediousness of continued allegory and that too seldom striking or ingenious has also contributed to render the fairy queen peculiarly tiresome not to mention the too great frequency of its descriptions and the langour of its stanza upon the whole spencer maintains his place in the shelves among our english classics but he is seldom seen on the table and scarce any one if he dares to be ingenuous but will confess that notwithstanding all the merit of the poet he affords an entertainment with which the palate is soon satiated several writers of late have amused themselves with copying the style of spencer and no imitation has been so indifferent as not to bear a great resemblance of the original his
