the parents assistant or stories for children part iivol ii containing the birthday present old poz the mimic   the second edition  london printed for j johnson in st pauls churchyard       the birthday present mamma said rosamond after a long silence do you know what i have been thinking of all this time  no my dear  what  why mamma about my cousin bells birthday do you know what day it is  no i dont remember  dear mother dont you remember its the   d of december and her birthday is the day after to  morrow  dont you recollect now but you never remember about birthdays mamma that was just what i was thinking of that you never remember my sister lauras birthday or  or  or mine mamma  what do you mean my dear i remember your birthday perfectly well  indeed but you never keep it though  what do you mean by keeping your birthday  oh mamma you know very well  as bells birthday is kept  in the first place there is a great dinner  and can bell eat more upon her birthday than upon any other day  no nor i should not mind about the dinner except the mince pies but bell has a great many nice things i dont mean nice eatable things but nice new playthings given to her always on her birthday and every body drinks her health and she is so happy  but stay rosamond how you jumble things together is it every bodys drinking her health that makes her so happy or the new playthings or the nice mince pies i can easily believe that she is happy whilst she is eating a mince pie or whilst she is playing but how does every bodys drinking her health at dinner make her happy  rosamond paused and then said she did not know but added she the nice new playthings mother  but why the nice new playthings did you like them only because they were new  not only  i do not like playthings only because they are new but bell does i believe  for that puts me in mind  do you know mother she had a great drawer full of old playthings that she never used and she said that they were good for nothing because they were old but i thought many of them were good for a great deal more than the new ones  now you shall be judge mamma i will tell you all that was in the drawer  nay rosamond thank you not just now i have not time to listen to you  well then mamma the day after tomorrow i can show you the drawer i want you to be judge very much because i am sure i was in the right  and mother added rosamond stopping her as she was going out of the room will you  not not now but when you have time  will you tell me why you never keep my birthday  why you never make any difference between that day and any other day  and will you rosamond  not now but when you have time to think about it  tell me why i should make any difference between your birthday and any other day  rosamond thought  but she could not find out any reason besides she suddenly recollected that she had not time to think any longer for there was a certain work basket to be finished which she was making for her cousin bell as a present upon her birthday the work was at a stand for want of some filigree paper and as her mother was going out she asked her to take her with her that she might buy some  her sister laura went with them  sister said rosamond as they were walking along what have you done with your halfguinea  i have it in my pocket  dear you will keep it for ever in your pocket you know my godmother when she gave it to you said you would keep it longer than i should keep mine and i know what she thought by her look at the time  i heard her say something to my mother  yes said laura smiling she whispered so loud that i could not help hearing her too she said i was a little miser  but did not you hear her say that i was very generous and she will see that she was not mistaken  i hope she will be by when i give my basket to bell  will not it be beautiful  there is to be a wreath of myrtle you know round the handle and a frost ground and then the medallions    stay interrupted her sister for rosamond anticipating the glories of her workbasket talked and walked so fast that she had passed without perceiving it the shop where the filigree paper was to be bought  they turned back now it happened that the shop was the corner house of a street and one of the windows looked out into a narrow lane a coach full of ladies stopped at the door just before they went in so that no one had time immediately to think of rosamond and her filigree paper and she went to the window where she saw that her sister laura was looking earnestly at something that was passing in the lane  opposite to the window at the door of a poor looking house there was sitting a little girl weaving lace her bobbins moved as quick as lightning and she never once looked up from her work  is not she very industrious said laura and very honest too added she in a minute afterward for just then a baker with a basket of rolls on his head passed and by accident one of the rolls fell close to the little girl she took it up eagerly looked at it as if she was very hungry then put aside her work and ran after the baker to return it to him  whilst she was gone a footman in a livery laced with silver who belonged to the coach that stood at the shop door as he was lounging with one of his companions chanced to spy the weaving pillow which she had left upon a stone before the door to divert himself for idle people do mischief often to divert themselves he took up the pillow and entangled all the bobbins the little girl came back out of breath to her work but what was her suprize and sorrow to find it spoiled she twisted and untwisted placed and replaced the bobbins whilst the footman stood laughing at her distress she got up gently and was retiring into the house when the silverlaced footman stopped her saying insolently  sit still child  i must go to my mother sir said the child besides you have spoiled all my lace  i cannot stay  cannot you said the brutal footman snatching her weaving pillow again i will teach you to complain of me and he broke off one after another all the bobbins put them in his pocket rolled her weaving pillow down the dirty lane then jumped up behind his mistresss coach and was out of sight in an instant  poor girl exclaimed rosamond no longer able to restrain her indignation at this injustice poor little girl  at this instant her mother said to rosamond  come now my dear if you want this filigree paper buy it  yes madam said rosamond and the idea of what her godmother and her cousin bell would think of her generosity rushed again upon her imagination all her feelings of pity were immediately suppressed satisfied with bestowing another exclamation upon the poor little girl she went to spend her halfguinea upon her filigree basket in the mean time she that was called the little miser beckoned to the poor girl and opening the window said pointing to the cushion is it quite spoiled  quite quite spoiled and i cannot nor mother neither buy another and i cannot do any thing else for my bread  a few but very few tears fell as she said this  how much would another cost said laura  oh a great  great deal  more than that said laura holding up her halfguinea  oh no  then you can buy another with that said laura dropping the halfguinea into her hand and she shut the window before the child could find words to thank her but not before she saw a look of joy and gratitude which gave laura more pleasure probably than all the praise which could have been bestowed upon her generosity  late on the morning of her cousins birth day rosamond finished her workbasket the carriage was at the door  laura came running to call her her fathers voice was heard at the same instant so she was obliged to go down with her basket but half wrapped up in silver paper a circumstance at which she was a good deal disconcerted for the pleasure of surprising bell would be utterly lost if one bit of the filigree should peep out before the proper time as the carriage went on rosamond pulled the paper to one side and to the other and by each of the four corners  it will never do my dear said her father who had been watching her operations i am afraid you will never make a sheet of paper cover a box which is twice as large as itself  it is not a box father said rosamond a little peevishly its a basket  let us look at this basket said he taking it out of her unwilling hands for she knew of what frail materials it was made and she dreaded its coming to pieces under her fathers examination  he took hold of the handle rather roughly and starting off the coach seat she cried   oh sir father sir you will spoil it indeed said she with increased vehemence when after drawing aside the veil of silver paper she saw him grasp the myrtlewreathed handle  indeed sir you will spoil the poor handle  but what is the use of the poor handle said her father if we are not to take hold of it and pray continued he turning the basket round with his finger and thumb rather in a disrespectful manner  pray is this the thing you have been about all this week i have seen you all this week dabbling with paste and rags i could not conceive what you were about  is this the thing  yes sir  you think then that i have wasted my time because the basket is of no use but then it is for a present for my cousin bell  your cousin bell will be very much obliged to you for a present that is of no use you had better have given her the purple jar  oh father i thought you had forgotten that  it was two years ago i am not so silly now but bell will like the basket i know though it is of no use  then you think bell is sillier now than you were two years ago  well perhaps that is true but how comes it rosamond now that you are so wise that you are fond of such a silly person   i father said rosamond hesitating i dont think i am very fond of her  i did not say very fond  well but i dont think i am at all fond of her  but you have spent a whole week in making this thing for her  yes and all my halfguinea besides  yet you think her silly and you are not fond of her at all and you say you know this thing will be of no use to her  but it is her birthday sir and i am sure she will expect something and every body else will give her something  then your reasons for giving are because she expects you to give her something and will you or can you or should you always give merely because others expect or because somebody else gives  always  no not always  oh only on birthdays  rosamond laughing now you are making a joke of me papa i see but i thought you liked that people should be generous  my godmother said that she did  so do i full as well as your godmother but we have not yet quite settled what it is to be generous  why is it not generous to make presents said rosamond  that is a question which it would take up a great deal of time to answer  but for instance to make a present of a thing that you know can be of no use to a person you neither love nor esteem because it is her birthday and because every body gives her something and because she expects something and because your godmother says she likes that people should be generous seems to me my dear rosamond to be since i must say it rather more like folly than generosity  rosamond looked down upon the basket and was silent  then i am a fool am i said she looking up at last  because you have made one mistake  no if you have sense enough to see your own mistakes and can afterward avoid them you will never be a fool  here the carriage stopped and rosamond recollected that the basket was uncovered  now we must observe that rosamonds father had not been too severe upon bell when he called her a silly girl  from her infancy she had been humoured and at eight years old she had the misfortune to be a spoiled child she was idle fretful and selfish so that nothing could make her happy on her birthday she expected however to be perfectly happy every body in the house tried to please her and they succeeded so well that between breakfast and dinner she had only six fits of crying the cause of five of these fits no one could discover but the last and most lamentable was occasioned by a disappointment about a worked muslin frock her mother had promised her a new frock and accordingly at dressingtime her maid brought it to her exclaiming  see here miss what your mamma has sent you on your birthday  here is a frock fit for a queen  if it had but lace round the cuffs  and why has not it lace round the cuffs mamma said it should  yes but mistress was disappointed about the lace it is not come home  not come home indeed and didnt they know it was my birthday but then i say i will not wear it without the lace  i cannot wear it without the lace  and i will not  the lace however could not be had and bell at length submitted to let the frock be put on come miss bell dry your eyes said the maid who educated her dry your eyes and i will tell you something that will please you  what then said the child pouting and sobbing  why  but you must not tell that i told you  no  but if i am asked  why if you are asked you must tell the truth to be sure  so i will hold my tongue miss  nay tell me though and i will never tell  if i am asked  well then said the maid your cousin rosamond is come and has brought you the most beautifullest thing you ever saw in your life but you are not to know any thing about it till after dinner because she wants to surprise you and mistress has put it in her wardrobe till after dinner  till after dinner repeated bell impatiently i cannot wait till then i must see it this minute  the maid refused her several times till bell burst into another fit of crying and the maid fearing that her mistress would be angry with her if bells eyes were red at dinnertime consented to show her the basket  how pretty  but let me have it in my own hands said bell as the maid held the basket up out of her reach  oh no you must not touch it for if you should spoil it what would become of me  become of you indeed exclaimed the spoiled child who never considered any thing but her own immediate gratification  become of you indeed what signifies that  i shall not spoil it and i will have it in my own hands  if you dont hold it down for me directly i will tell that you showed it to me  then you will not snatch it  no no i will not indeed said bell but she had learned from her maid a total disregard of truth  she snatched the basket the moment it was within her reach a struggle ensued in which the handle and lid were torn off and one of the medallions crushed inwards before the little fury returned to her senses calmed at this sight the next question was how she should conceal the mischief which she had done after many attempts the handle and lid were replaced the basket was put exactly in the same spot in which it had stood before and the maid charged the child  to look as if nothing was the matter  we hope that both children and parents will here pause for a moment to reflect  the habits of tyranny meanness and falsehood which children acquire from living with bad servants are scarcely ever conquered in the whole course of their future lives  after shutting up the basket they left the room and in the adjoining passage they found a poor girl waiting with a small parcel in her hand  what is your business said the maid  i have brought home the lace madam that was bespoke for the young lady  oh you have have you at last said bell and pray why didnt you bring it sooner  the girl was going to answer but the maid interrupted her saying  come come none of your excuses you are a little idle good for nothing thing to disappoint miss bell upon her birthday  but now you have brought it let us look at it the little girl gave the lace without reply and the maid desired her to go about her business and not to expect to be paid for that her mistress could not see any body because she was in a room full of company  may i call again madam this afternoon said the child timidly  lord bless my stars replied the maid what makes people so poor i wonders i wish mistress would buy her lace at the warehouse as i told her and not of these folks  call again yes to be sure  i believe you would call call call twenty times for twopence  however ungraciously the permission to call again was granted it was received with gratitude the little girl departed with a cheerful countenance and bell teized her maid till she got her to sew the long wished for lace upon her cuffs  unfortunate bell  all dinnertime passed and people were so hungry so busy or so stupid that not an eye observed her favorite piece of finery till at length she was no longer able to conceal her impatience and turning to laura who sat next to her she said  you have no lace upon your cuffs look how beautiful mine is  is not it dont you wish your mamma could afford to give you some like it  but you cannot get any if she would for this was made on purpose for me on my birthday and nobody can get a bit more any where if they would give the world for it  but cannot the person who made it said laura make any more like it  no no no cried bell for she had already learned either from her maid or her mother the mean pride which values things not for being really pretty or useful but for being such as nobody else can procure  nobody can get any like it i say repeated bell nobody in all london can make it but one person and that person will never make a bit for any body but me i am sure  mamma will not let her if i ask her not  very well said laura coolly i do not want any of it you need not be so violent i assure you that i dont want any of it  yes but you do though said bell more angrily  no indeed said laura smiling  you do in the bottom of your heart but you say you dont to plague me i know cried bell swelling with disappointed vanity  it is pretty for all that and it cost a great deal of money too and nobody shall have any like it if they cried their eyes out  laura received this sentence in silence  rosamond smiled and at her smile the illsuppressed rage of the spoiled child burst forth into the seventh and loudest fit of crying which had been heard upon her birthday  what is the matter my pet cried her mother come to me and tell me what is the matter  bell ran roaring to her mother but no otherwise explained the cause of her sorrow than by tearing the fine lace with frantic gestures from her cuffs and throwing the fragments into her mothers lap  oh the lace child  are you mad said her mother catching hold of both her hands your beautiful lace my dear love  do you know how much it cost  i dont care how much it cost  it is not beautiful and i will have none of it replied bell sobbing  for it is not beautiful  but it is beautiful retorted her mother i chose the pattern myself  who has put it into your head child to dislike it  was it nancy  no not nancy but them mamma said bell pointing to laura and rosamond  oh fie dont point said her mother putting down her stubborn finger nor say them like nancy i am sure you misunderstood  miss laura i am sure did not mean any such thing  no madam and i did not say any such thing that i recollect said laura gently  oh no indeed cried rosamond warmly rising in her sisters defense but no defense or explanation was to be heard for every body had now gathered round bell to dry her tears and to comfort her for the mischief she had done to her own cuffs  they succeeded so well that in about a quarter of an hour the young ladys eyes and the reddened arches over her eyebrows came to their natural color and the business being thus happily hushed up the mother as a reward to her daughter for her good humor begged that rosamond would now be so good as to produce her charming present  rosamond followed by all the company amongst whom to her great joy was her godmother proceeded to the dressing room  now i am sure thought she bell will be surprised and my godmother will see she was right about my generosity  the doors of the wardrobe were opened with due ceremony and the filigree basket appeared in all its glory  well this is a charming present indeed said the godmother who was one of the company  my rosamond knows how to make presents and as she spoke she took hold of the basket to lift it down to the admiring audience scarcely had she touched it when lo the myrtle wreath the medallions all dropped  the basket fell to the ground and only the handle remained in her hand  all eyes were fixed upon the wreck exclamations of sorrow were heard in various tones and who can have done this was all that rosamond could say bell stood in sullen silence which she obstinately preserved in the midst of the enquiries which were made about the disaster at length the servants were summoned and amongst them nancy miss bells maid and governess she affected much surprise when she saw what had befallen the basket and declared that she knew nothing of the matter but that she had seen her mistress in the morning put it quite safe into the wardrobe and that for her part she had never touched it or thought of touching it in her born days  nor miss bell neither maam i can answer for her for she never knew of its being there because i never so much as mentioned it to her that there was such a thing in the house because i knew miss rosamond wanted to surprise her with the secret  so i never mentioned a sentence of it  did i miss bell  bell putting on the deceitful look which her maid had taught her answered boldly no but she had hold of rosamonds hand and at the instant she uttered this falsehood she squeezed it terribly  why do you squeeze my hand so said rosamond in a low voice what are you afraid of  afraid of cried bell turning angrily i am not afraid of any thing  i have nothing to be afraid about  nay i did not say you had whispered rosamond but only if you did by accident  you know what i mean  i should not be angry if you did  only say so  i say i did not cried bell furiously mamma  mamma  nancy my cousin rosamond will not believe me that is very hard  it is very rude and i will not bear it  i will not  dont be angry love  dont said the maid  nobody suspects you darling said her mother  but she has too much sensibility  dont cry love nobody suspected you  but you know continued she turning to the maid somebody must have done this and i must know how it was done miss rosamonds charming present must not be spoiled in this way in my house without my taking proper notice of it  i assure you i am very angry about it rosamond  rosamond did not rejoice in her anger and had nearly made a sad mistake by speaking loud her thoughts  i was very foolish   she began and stopped  maam cried the maid suddenly i will venture to say i know who did it  who said every one eagerly  who said bell trembling  why miss dont you recollect that little girl with the lace that we saw peeping about in the passage i am sure she must have done it for here she was by herself half an hour or more and not another creature has been in mistresss dressing room to my certain knowledge since morning those sort of people have so much curiosity i am sure she must have been meddling with it added the maid  oh yes that is the thing said the mistress decidedly  well miss rosamond for your comfort she shall never come into my house again  oh that would not comfort me at all said rosamond besides we are not sure that she did it and if   a single knock at the door was heard at this instant it was the little girl who came to be paid for her lace  call her in said the lady of the house let us see her directly  the maid who was afraid that the girls innocence would appear if she were produced hesitated but upon her mistresss repeating her commands she was forced to obey  the child came in with a look of simplicity but when she saw the room full of company she was a little abashed rosamond and laura looked at her and at one another with surprise for it was the same little girl whom they had seen weaving lace  is not it she whispered rosa mond to her sister  yes it is but hush said laura she does not know us  dont say a word let us hear what she will say laura got behind the rest of the company as she spoke so that the little girl could not see her  vastly well said bells mother i am waiting to see how long you will have the assurance to stand there with that innocent look did you ever see that basket before  yes maam said the girl  yes maam cried the maid and what else do you know about it  you had better confess it at once and mistress perhaps will say no more about it  yes do confess it added bell earnestly  confess what madam said the little girl i never touched the basket madam  you never touched it but you confess interrupted bells mother that you did see it before  and pray how came you to see it you must have opened my wardrobe  no indeed madam said the little girl but i was waiting in the passage maam and this door was partly open and looking at the maid you know i could not help seeing it  why how could you see it through the doors of my wardrobe rejoined the lady  the maid frightened pulled the little girl by the sleeve  answer me said the lady where did you see this basket  another stronger pull  i saw it madam in her hands looking at the maid and    well and what became of it afterward  maam hesitating miss pulled and by accident  i believe i saw maam  miss you know what i saw  i do not know  i do not know and if i did  you had no business there  and mamma will not believe you i am sure  but every body else did and their eyes were fixed upon bell in a manner which made her feel rather ashamed  what do you all look at me so for  why do you all look so  and am i to be shamed upon my birthday cried she bursting into a roar of passion and all for this nasty thing added she pushing away the remains of the basket and looking angrily at rosamond  bell bell oh fie fie now i am ashamed of you  that is quite rude to your cousin said her mother who was more shocked at her daughters want of politeness than at her falsehood take her away nancy till she has done crying added she to the maid who accordingly carried off her pupil  rosamond during this scene especially at the moment when her present was pushed away with such disdain had been making reflections upon the nature of true generosity a smile from her father who stood by a silent spectator of the catastrophe of the filigree basket gave rise to these reflections nor were they entirely dissipated by the condolence of the rest of the company nor even by the praises of her godmother who to console her said  well my dear rosamond i admire your generous spirit you know i prophesied that your halfguinea would be gone the soonest  did i not laura said she appealing in a sarcastic tone to where she thought laura was  where is laura i dont see her  laura came forward  you are too prudent to throw away your money like your sister your halfguinea i will answer for it is snug in your pocket  is it not  no madam answered she in a low voice but low as the voice was the poor little lacegirl heard it and now for the first time fixing her eyes upon laura recollected her benefactress  oh that is the young lady she exclaimed in a tone of joyful gratitude  the good  good young lady who gave me the halfguinea and would not stay to be thanked for it  but i will thank her now  the halfguinea laura said her godmother  what is all this  i will tell you madam if you please said the little girl  it was not in expectation of being praised for it that laura had been generous and therefore every body was really touched with the history of the weavingpillow and whilst they praised felt a certain degree of respect which is not always felt by those who pour forth eulogiums respect is not an improper word even applied to a child of lauras age for let the age or situation of the person be what it may they command respect who deserve it  ah madam said rosamond to her godmother now you see  you see she is not a little miser i am sure that is better than wasting half a guinea upon a filigree basket  is it not maam said she with an eagerness which showed that she had forgotten all her own misfortunes in sympathy with her sister  this is being really generous father is it not  yes rosamond said her father and he kissed her  this is being really generous it is not only by giving away money that we can show generosity it is by giving up to others any thing that we like ourselves and therefore added he smiling it is really generous of you to give your sister the thing you like best of all others  the thing i like the best of all others father said rosamond half pleased half vexed what is that i wonder  you dont mean praise do you sir  nay you must decide that rosamond  why sir said she ingenuously perhaps it was once the thing i liked best but the pleasure i have just felt makes me like something else better  old poz lucy daughter to the justice mrs bustle landlady of the saracens head justice headstrong old man william a servant scene i

more  but do justice immediately to the goosepye  and darling put me in mind to tell this story after dinner   after they go out the justice stops tell this story  i dont know whether it tells well for me  but i will never be positive any more  that is poz   the mimic mr and mrs montague spent the summer of the year      at clifton with their son frederick and their two daughters sophia and marianne  they had taken much care of the education of their children nor were they ever tempted by any motive of personal convenience or temporary amusement to hazard the permanent happiness of their pupils  sensible of the extreme importance of early impressions and of the powerful influence of external circumstances in forming the character and the manners they were now anxious that the variety of new ideas and new objects which would strike the minds of their children should appear in a just point of view  let children see and judge for themselves is often inconsiderately said  where children see only a part they cannot judge of the whole  and from the superficial view which they can have in short visits and desultory conversation they can form only a false estimate of the objects of human happiness a false notion of the nature of society and false opinions of characters  for these reasons mr and mrs montague were particularly cautious in the choice of their acquaintance as they were well aware that whatever passed in conversation before their children became part of their education  when they came to clifton they wished to have had a house entirely to themselves but as they came late in the season almost all the lodging houses were full and for a few weeks they were obliged to remain in a house in which some of the apartments were already occupied  during the first fortnight they scarcely saw or heard any thing of one of the families who lodged on the same floor with them  an elderly quaker and his sister birtha were their silent neighbors  the blooming complexion of the lady had indeed attracted the attention of the children as they caught a glimpse of her face when she was getting into her carriage to go out upon the downs  they could scarcely believe that she came to the wells on account of her health  besides her blooming complexion the delicate white of her garments had struck them with admiration and they observed that her brother carefully guarded these from the wheel of the carriage as he handed her in  from this circumstance and from the benevolent countenance of the old gentleman they concluded that he was very fond of his sister  that they were certainly very happy only they never spoke and could be seen but for a moment  not so the maiden lady who occupied the ground floor  on the stairs in the passages at her window she was continually visible and she seemed to possess the art of being present in all these places at once  her voice was eternally to be heard and it was not particularly melodious the very first day she met mrs montagues children on the stairs she stopped to tell marianne that she was a charming dear and a charming little dear to kiss her to enquire her name and to inform her that her own name was mrs theresa tattle a circumstance of which there was little danger of their long remaining in ignorance for in the course of one morning at least twenty single and as many double raps at the door were succeeded by vociferations of mrs theresas tattles servant  mrs theresa tattle at home  mrs theresa tattle not at home  no person at the wells was oftener at home and abroad than mrs tattle she had as she deemed it the happiness to have a most extensive acquaintance residing at clifton  she had for years kept a register of arrivals she regularly consulted the subscriptions to the circulating libraries and the lists at the ball and the pumprooms so that with a memory unincumbered with literature and free from all domestic cares she contrived to retain a most astonishing and correct list of births deaths and marriages together with all the anecdotes amusing instructive or scandalous which are necessary to the conversation of a waterdrinking place and essential to the character of a very pleasant woman  a very pleasant woman mrs tattle was usually called and conscious of her accomplishments she was eager to introduce herself to the acquaintance of her new neighbors having with her ordinary expedition collected from their servants by means of her own all that could be known or rather all that could be told about them the name of montague at all events she knew was a good name and justified her courting this acquaintance she courted it first by nods and becks and smiles at marianne whenever she met her and marianne who was a very little girl began presently to nod and smile in return persuaded that a lady who smiled so much could not be illnatured besides mrs theresas parlour door was sometimes left more than half open to afford a view of a green parrot marianne sometimes passed very slowly by this door one morning it was left quite wide open she stopped to say pretty poll and immediately mrs tattle begged she would do her the honor to walk in and see pretty poll at the same time taking the liberty to offer her a piece of iced plumb cake  the next day mrs theresa tattle did herself the honor to wait upon mrs montague to apologize for the liberty she had taken in inviting mrs montagues charming miss marianne into her apartment to see pretty poll and for the still greater liberty she had taken in offering her a piece of plumb cake inconsiderate creature that she was which might possibly have disagreed with her and which certainly were liberties she never should have been induced to take if she had not been unaccountably bewitched by miss mariannes striking though highly flattering resemblance to a young gentleman an officer with whom she had danced she was sorry to say now nearly twelve years ago at the races in  shire of the name of montague a most respectable young man and of a most respectable family with which in a remote degree she might presume to say she herself was someway connected having the honor to be nearly related to the joness of merionethshire who were cousins to the manwairings of bedfordshire who married into the family of the griffithss the eldest branch of which she understood had the honor to be cousin german to mr montague on which account she had been impatient to pay a visit so likely to be productive of most agreeable consequences in the acquisition of an acquaintance whose society must do her infinite honor  having thus happily accomplished her first visit there seemed little probability of escaping mrs tattles farther acquaintance in the course of the first week she only hinted to mr montague that some people thought his system of education rather odd that she should be obliged to him if he would some time or other when he had nothing else to do just sit down and make her understand his notions that she might have something to say to her acquaintance as she always wished to have when she heard any friend attacked or any friends opinions  mr montague declining to sit down and make this lady understand a system of education only to give her something to say and showing unaccountable indifference about the attacks with which he was threatened mrs tattle next addressed herself to mrs montague prophesying in a most serious whisper that the charming miss marianne would shortly and inevitably grow quite crooked if she were not immediately provided with a backboard a french dancing master and a pair of stocks this alarming whisper could not however have a permanent effect upon mrs montagues understanding because three days afterward mrs theresa upon the most anxious inspection mistook the hip and shoulder which should have been the highest this danger vanishing mrs tattle presently with a rueful length of face and formal preface hesitated to assure mrs montague that she was greatly distressed about her daughter sophy that she was convinced her lungs were affected and that she certainly ought to drink the waters morning and evening and above all things must keep one of the patirossa lozenges constantly in her mouth and directly consult dr cardimum the best physician in the world and the person she would send for herself upon her death bed because to her certain knowledge he had recovered a young lady a relation of her own after she had lost one whole globe of her lungs  the medical opinion of a lady of so much anatomical precision could not have much weight nor was this universal adviser more successful in an attempt to introduce a tutor to frederick who she apprehended must want one to perfect him in the latin and greek and dead languages of which she observed it would be impertinent for a woman to talk only she might venture to repeat what she had heard said by good authority that a competency of the dead tongues could be had no where but at a public school or else from a private tutor who had been abroad after the advantages of a classical education finished in one of the universities with a good family without which introduction it was idle to think of reaping solid advantages from any continental tour all which requisites she could from personal knowledge aver concentrated in the gentleman she had the honor to recommend as having been tutor to a young nobleman who had now no farther occasion for him being unfortunately for himself and his family killed in an untimely duel  all her suggestions being lost upon these unthinking parents mrs theresa tattles powers were next tried upon the children and presently her success was apparent on sophy indeed she could not make any impression though she had expended on her some of her finest strokes of flatterysophy though very desirous of the approbation of her friends was not very solicitous to win the favor of strangers she was about thirteen that dangerous age at which ill educated girls in their anxiety to display their accomplishments are apt to become dependent for applause upon the praise of every idle visitor when the habits not being formed and the aftention being suddenly turned to dress and manners girls are apt to affect and imitate indiscriminately every thing that they fancy to be agreeable  sophy whose taste had been cultivated at the same time with her powers of reasoning was not liable to fall into these errors she found that she could please those whom she wished to please without affecting to be any thing but what she really was and her friends listened to what she said though she never repeated the sentiments or adopted the phrases which she might easily have caught from the conversation of those who were older or more fashionable than herself this word fashionable mrs theresa tattle knew had usually a great effect even at thirteen but she had not observed that it had much power upon sophy nor were her documents concerning grace and manners much attended to her mother had taught sophy that it was best to let herself alone and not to distort either her person or her mind in acquiring grimace which nothing but the fashion of the moment can support and which is always detected and despised by people of real good sense and politeness  bless me said mrs tattle to herself if i had such a tall daughter and so unformed before my eyes from morning to night it would certainly break my poor heart thank god i am not a mother miss marianne for me if i was  miss marianne had heard so often from mrs tattle that she was charming that she could not help believing it and from being a very pleasing unaffected little girl she in a short time grew so conceited that she could neither speak look move or be silent without imagining that every body was or ought to be looking at her and when mrs theresa saw that mrs montague looked very grave upon these occasions she to repair the ill she had done would say after praising mariannes hair or her eyes oh but little ladies should never think about their beauty you know nobody loves any body you know for being handsome but for being good people must think children are very silly or else they can never have reflected upon the nature of belief in their own minds if they imagine that children will believe the words that are said to them by way of moral when the countenance manner and every concomitant circumstance tell them a different tale children are excellent physiognomists they quickly learn the universal language of looks and what is said of them always makes a greater impression than what is said to them a truth of which those prudent people surely cannot be aware who comfort themselves and apologize to parents by saying o but i would not say so and so to the child  mrs theresa had seldom said to frederick montague that he had a vast deal of drollery and was a most incomparable mimic but she had said so of him in whispers which magnified the sound to his imagination if not to his ear he was a boy of much vivacity and had considerable abilities but his appetite for vulgar praise had not yet been surfeited even mrs theresa tattles flattery pleased him and he exerted himself for her entertainment so much that he became quite a buffoon instead of observing characters and manners that he might judge of them and form his own he now watched every person he saw that he might detect some foible or catch some singularity in their gesture or pronunciation which he might successfully mimic  alarmed by the rapid progress of these evils mr and mrs montague who from the first day that they had been honored with mrs tattles visit had begun to look out for new lodgings were now extremely impatient to decamp they were not people who from the weak fear of offending a silly acquaintance would hazard the happiness of their family they had heard of a house in the country which was likely to suit them and they determined to go directly to look at it as they were to be absent all day they foresaw their officious neighbor would probably interfere with their children they did not choose to exact any promise from them which they might be tempted to break and therefore they only said at parting if mrs theresa tattle should ask you to come to her do as you think proper  scarcely had mrs montagues carriage gone out of hearing when a note was brought directed to frederick montague esquire junior which he immediately opened and read as follows  mrs theresa tattle presents her very best compliments to the entertaining mr frederick montague she hopes he will have the charity to drink tea with her this evening and bring his charming sister marianne with him as mrs theresa will be quite alone with a shocking headache and is sensible her nerves are affected and dr cardimum says that especially in mrs t ts case it is downright death to nervous patients to be alone an instant she therefore trusts mr frederick will not refuse to come and make her laugh  mrs theresa has taken care to provide a few macaroons for her little favorite who said she was particularly fond of them the other day  mrs theresa hopes they will all come at six or before not forgetting miss sophy if she will condescend to be of the party  at the first reading of this note the entertaining mr frederick and the charming miss marianne laughed heartily and looked at sophy as if they were afraid that she should think it possible they could like such gross flattery but upon a second perusal marianne observed that it certainly was goodnatured of mrs theresa to remember the macaroons and frederick allowed that it was wrong to laugh at the poor woman because she had the headache then twisting the note in his fingers he appealed to sophy well sophy leave off drawing for an instant and tell us what answer can we send can we can send what answer we please yes i know that said frederick i would refuse if i could but we ought not to do any thing rude should we so i think we might as well go hey because we could not refuse if we would i say  you have made such confusion replied sophy between could nt and would nt and should nt that i cannot understand you surely they are all different things  different no cried frederick could would should might or ought are all the same thing in the latin grammar all of em signs of the potential mood you know  sophy whose powers of reasoning were not to be confounded even by quotations from the latin grammar looked up soberly from her drawing and answered that very likely those words might be signs of the same thing in the latin grammar but that she believed they meant perfectly different things in real life  that is just as people please said her sophistical brother you know words mean nothing in themselves if i chose to call my hat my cadwallader you would understand me just as well after i had once explained it to you that by cadwallader i meant this black thing that i put upon my head cadwallader and that would then be just the same thing to you  then why have two words for the same thing said sophy and what has this to do with could and should you wanted to prove   i wanted to prove interrupted frederick that it is not worth while to dispute for two hours about two words do keep to the point sophy and dont dispute with me  i was not disputing i was reasoning  well reasoning or disputing women have no business to do either for how should they know how to chop logic like men  at this contemptuous sarcasm upon her sex sophys color rose there cried frederick exulting now we shall see a philosopheress in a passion i would give sixpence half price for a harlequin entertainment to see sophy in a passion now marianne look at her brush dabbling so fast in the water  sophy who could not easily bear to be laughed at with some little indignation said brother i wish  there there cried frederick pointing to the color which rose in her cheek almost to her temples rising rising rising look at the thermometer blood heat blood fever heat boiling water heat marianne  then said sophy smiling you should stand a little farther off both of you leave the thermometer to itself for a little while give it time to cool it will come down to temperate by the time you look again  oh brother cried marianne she is so good humored dont teize her any more and dont draw heads upon her paper and dont stretch her rubber out and dont let us dirty any more of her brushes see the sides of her tumbler are all manner of colors  oh i only mixed red blue green and yellow to show you marianne that all colors mixed together make white but she is temperate now and i will not plague her she shall chop logic if she likes it though she is a woman  but that is not fair brother said marianne to say woman in that way i am sure sophy found out how to tie that difficult knot which papa showed to us yesterday long before you did though you are a man not long said frederick besides that was only a conjuring trick  it was very ingenious though said marianne and papa said so and besides she understood the rule of three which was no conjuring trick better than you did though she is a woman and she may reason too mamma says  very well let her reason away said the provoking wit all i have to say is she will never be able to make a pudding why not pray brother enquired sophy looking up again very gravely why you know papa himself the other day at dinner said that that woman who talks greek and latin as well as i do is a fool after all and that she had better have learned something useful and mrs tattle said she would answer for it she did not know how to make a pudding  well but i am not talking greek and latin am i  no but you are drawing and that is the same thing  the same thing o frederick said little marianne laughing  you may laugh but i say it is the same sort of thing women that are always drawing and reasoning never know how to make puddings mrs theresa tattle said so when i showed her sophys beautiful drawing yesterday  mrs theresa tattle might say so replied sophy calmly but i do not perceive the reason brother why drawing should prevent me from learning how to make a pudding  well i say you will never learn to make a good pudding  i have learned continued sophy who was mixing her colors to mix such and such colors together to make the color that i want and why should i not be able to learn to mix flour and butter and sugar and egg together to make the taste that i want  oh but mixing will never do unless you know the quantities like a cook and you would never learn the right quantities  how did the cook learn them cannot i learn them as she did  yes but you would never do it exactly and mind the spoonfuls rightly by the receipt like a cook exactly  indeed indeed but she would cried marianne eagerly and a great deal more exactly for mamma has taught her to weigh and measure things very carefully and when i was ill she always weighed my bark so nicely and dropped my drops so carefully not like the cook when mamma took me down to see her make a cake once i saw her spoonfuls and her ounces and her handfuls she dashed and splashed without minding exactness or the receipt or any thing i am sure sophy would make a much better pudding if exactness only is wanting  well granting that she could make the best pudding in the whole world what does that signify i say she never would so it comes to the same thing  never would how can you tell that brother  never would how can you tell that brother  why now look at her with her books and her drawings and all this apparatus do you think she would ever jump up with all her nicety too and put bye all these things to go down into the greasy kitchen and plump up to the elbows in suet like a cook for a plumb pudding  i need not plump up to the elbows brother said sophy smiling nor is it necessary that i should be a cook but if it were necessary i hope i should be able to make a pudding  yes yes yes cried marianne warmly that she would jump up and put by all her things in a minute if it was necessary and run down stairs and up again like lightning or do any thing that was ever so disagreeable to her even about the suet with all the nicety brother i assure you as she used to do any thing every thing for me when i was ill last winter oh brother she can do any thing and she could make the best plumb pudding in the whole world i am sure in a minute if it was necessary  the mimic part ii a knock at the door from mrs theresa tattles servant recalled marianne to the business of the day  there said frederick we have sent no answer all this time it is necessary to think of that in a minute  the servant came with his mistresss compliments to let the young ladies and mr frederick know that she was waiting tea for them  waiting then we must go said frederick  the servant opened the door wider to let him pass and marianne thought she must follow her brother so they went down stairs together whilst sophy gave her own message to the servant and quietly staid at her usual occupations  mrs tattle was seated at her teatable with a large plate of macaroons beside her when frederick and marianne entered she was delighted they were come and grieved not to see miss sophy along with them marianne colored a little for though she had precipitately followed her brother and though he had quieted her conscience for a moment by saying you know papa and mamma told us to do what we thought best yet she did not feel quite pleased with herself and it was not till after mrs theresa had exhausted all her compliments and half her macaroons that she could restore her spirits to their usual height  come mr frederick said she after tea you promised to make me laugh and nobody can make me laugh so well as yourself  oh brother said marianne show mrs theresa dr carbuncle eating his dinner and i will be mrs carbuncle  marianne now my dear what shall i help you to   frederick my dear she never calls him my dear you know but always doctor   mar well then doctor what will you eat today   fred eat madam eat nothing nothing i

is as hard as a deal board you might as well tell me to cut the table maam mutton indeed not a bit of fat roast mutton indeed not a drop of gravy mutton truly quite a cinder i will have none of it here take it away take it down stairs to the cook it is a very hard case mrs carbuncle that i can never have a bit of any thing that i can eat at my own table mrs carbuncle since i was married maam i that am the easiest man in the whole world to please about my dinner it is really very extraordinary mrs carbuncle what have you got at that corner there under the cover   mar patties sir oyster patties   fred patties maam kickshaws i hate kickshaws not worth putting under a cover maam and why have not you glass covers that one may see ones dinner before one before it grows cold with asking questions mrs carbuncle and lifting up covers but nobody has any sense and i see no waterplates any where lately   mar do pray doctor let me help you to a bit of this chicken before it gets cold my dear   fred aside my dear again marianne   mar yes brother because she is frightened you know and mrs carbuncle always says my dear to him when she is frightened and looks so pale from side to side and sometimes she cries before dinners done and then all the company are quite silent and dont know what to do  oh such a little creature to have so much sense too exclaimed mrs theresa with rapture mr frederick you will make me die with laughing pray go on doctor carbuncle   fred well maam then if i must eat something send me a bit of fowl a leg and wing the liverwing and a bit of the breast oyster sauce and a slice of that ham if you please maam  doctor carbuncle eats voraciously with his head down to his plate and dropping the sauce he buttons up his coat tight across the breast fred here  a plate knife and fork bit obread a glass of dorchester ale  oh admirable exclaimed mrs tattle clapping her hands  now brother suppose that it is after dinner said marianne and show us how the doctor goes to sleep  frederick threw himself back in an arm chair leaning his head back with his mouth open snoring nodded from time to time crossed and uncrossed his legs tried to waken himself by twitching his wig settling his collar blowing his nose and wrapping on the lid of his snuffbox  all which infinitely diverted mrs tattle who when she could stop herself from laughing declared it made her sigh too to think of the life poor mrs carbuncle led with that man and all for nothing too for her jointure was nothing next to nothing though a great thing to be sure her friends thought for her when she was only sally ridgeway before she was married such a wife as she makes continued mrs theresa lifting up her hands and eyes to heaven and so much as she has gone through the brute ought to be ashamed of himself if he does not leave her something extraordinary in his will for turn it which way she will she can never keep a carriage or live like any body else on her jointure after all she tells me poor soul a sad prospect after her husbands death to look forward to instead of being comfortable as her friends expected and she poor young thing knowing no better when they married her people should look into these things before hand or never marry at all i say miss marianne  miss marianne who did not clearly comprehend this affair of the jointure or the reason why mrs carbuncle would be so unhappy after her husbands death turned to frederick who was at that instant studying mrs theresa as a future character to mimic brother said marianne now sing an italian song for us like miss croker pray miss croker favor us with a song mrs theresa tattle has never had the pleasure of hearing you sing she is quite impatient to hear you sing  yes indeed i am said mrs theresa  frederick put his hands before him affectedly oh indeed maam indeed ladies i really am so hoarse it distresses me so to be pressed to sing besides upon my word i have quite left off singing i have never sung once except for very particular people this winter   mar but mrs theresa tattle is a very particular person i am sure you will sing for her   fred certainly maam i allow you use a powerful argument but i assure you now i would do my best to oblige you but i absolutely have forgotten all my english songs nobody hears any thing but italian now and i have been so giddy as to leave my italian music behind me besides i make it a rule never to hazard myself without an accompanyment   mar oh try miss croker for once  frederick sings after much preluding violante in the pantry gnawing of a mutton bone how she gnawed it how she clawed it when she found herself alone charming exclaimed mrs tattle so like miss croker i am sure i shall think of you mr frederick when i hear her asked to sing again her voice however introduces her to very pleasant parties and she is a girl that is very much taken notice of and i dont doubt will go off vastly well she is a particular favorite of mine you must know and i mean to do her a piece of service the first opportunity by saying something or other that shall go round to her relations in northumberland and make them do something for her as well they may for they are all rolling in gold and will not give her a penny   mar now brother read the newspaper like counselor puff  oh pray do mr frederick for i declare i admire you of all things you are quite yourself tonight here is a newspaper sir pray let us have counselor puff it is not late  frederick reads in a pompous voice as a delicate white hand has ever been deemed a distinguishing ornament in either sex messrs valiant and wise conceive it to be their duty to take the earliest opportunity to advertise the nobility and gentry of great britain in general and their friends in particular that they have now ready for sale as usual at the hippocratess head a fresh assortment of the newinvented much admired primrose soap  to prevent impositions and counterfeits the public are requested to take notice that the only genuine primrose soap is stamped on the outside valiant and wise  oh you most incomparable mimic it is absolutely the counselor himself i absolutely must show you some day to my friend lady batersby you would absolutely make her die with laughing and she would quite adore you said mrs theresa who was well aware that every pause must be filled with flattery pray go on pray go on i shall never be tired if i were to sit looking at you these hundred years  stimulated by these plaudits frederick proceeded to show how colonel epaulette blew his nose flourished his cambric handkerchief bowed to lady di periwinkle and admired her work saying done by no hands as you may guess but those of fairly fair whilst lady di he observed simpered so prettily and took herself so quietly for fairly fair not perceiving that the colonel was admiring his own nails all the while  next to colonel epaulette frederick at mariannes particular desire came into the room like sir charles slang  very well brother cried she your hand down to the very bottom of your pocket and your other shoulder up to your ear but you are not quite wooden enough and you should walk as if your hip was out of joint there now mrs tattle are not those good eyes they stare so like his without seeming to see any thing all the while  excellent admirable mr frederick i must say you are the best mimic of your age i ever saw and i am sure lady battersby will think so too that is sir charles to the very life but with all that you must know he is a mighty pleasant fashionable young man when you come to know him and has a great deal of sense under all that and is of a very good family the slangs you know sir charles will come into a fine fortune himself next year if he can keep clear of gambling which i hear is his foible poor young man pray go on i interrupt you mr frederick  now brother said marianne  no marianne i can do no more i am quite tired and i will do no more said frederick stretching himself at full length upon a sofa  even in the midst of laughter and whilst the voice of flattery yet sounded in his ear frederick felt sad displeased with himself and disgusted with mrs theresa  what a deep sigh was there said mrs theresa what can make you sigh so bitterly you who make every body else laugh oh such another sigh again  marianne cried frederick do you remember the man in the mask  what man in the mask brother  the man  the actor  the buffoon that my father told us of who used to cry behind the mask that made every body else laugh  cry bless me said mrs theresa mighty odd very extraordinary but one cannot be surprised at meeting with extraordinary characters amongst that race of people actors by profession you know who are brought up from the egg to make their fortune or at least their bread by their oddities but my dear mr frederick you are quite pale quite exhausted no wonder what will you have a glass of cowslip wine  oh no thank you maam said frederick  oh yes indeed you must not leave me without taking something and miss marianne must have another macaroon i insist upon it said mrs theresa ringing the bell it is not late and my man christopher will bring up the cowslip wine in a minute  but sophy and papa and mamma you know will come home just now said marianne  oh miss sophy has her books and drawings you know she is never afraid of being alone besides tonight it was her own choice and as to your papa and mamma they will not be home tonight i am pretty sure for a gentleman who had it from their own authority told me where they were going which is farther off than they think but they did not consult me and i fancy they will be obliged to sleep out so you need not be in a hurry about them well have candles  the door opened just as mrs tattle was going to ring the bell again for candles and the cowslip wine christopher christopher said mrs theresa who was standing at the fire with her back to the door when it opened christopher pray bring  do you hear but no christopher answered and upon turning round mrs tattle instead of christopher beheld two little black figures which stood perfectly still and silent it was so dark that their forms could scarcely be discerned  in the name of heaven who and what may you be speak i conjure you what are ye  the chimney sweepers maam an please your ladyship  chimney sweepers repeated frederick and marianne bursting out a laughing  chimney sweepers repeated mrs theresa provoked at the recollection of her late solemn address to them chimney sweepers and could not you say so a little sooner and pray what brings you here gentlemen at this time of night  the bell rang maam answered the squeaking voice  the bell rang yes for christopher the boys mad or drunk  maam said the tallest of the chimney sweepers who had not yet spoken and who now began in a very blunt manner maam your brother desired us to come up when the bell rang so we did  my brother i have no brother dunce said mrs theresa  mr eden madam  oh ho said mrs tattle in a more complacent tone the boy takes me for miss birtha eden i perceive and flattered to be taken in the dark by a chimney sweeper for a young and handsome lady mrs theresa laughed and informed him that they had mistaken the room that they must go up another pair of stairs and turn to the left  the chimney sweeper with the squeaking voice bowed thanked her ladyship for this information said good night to ye quality and they both moved toward the door  stay said mrs tattle whose curiosity was excited what can the edens want with chimney sweepers at this time onight i wonder christopher did you hear any thing about it said the lady to her footman who was now lighting the candles  upon my word maam said the servant i cannot say but i will step down below and enquire i heard them talking about it in the kitchen but i only got a word here and there for i was hunting for the snuffdish as i knew it must be for candles when i heard the bell ring maam so i thought to find the snuffdish before i answered the bell for i knew it must be for candles you rang but if you please i will step down now maam and see about the chimneysweeps  yes step down do and christopher bring up the cowslip wine and some more macaroons for my little marianne  marianne withdrew rather coldly from a kiss which mrs tattle was going to give her for she was somewhat surprised at the familiarity with which this lady talked to her footman she had not been used to these manners in her father and mother and she did not like them  well said mrs tattle to christopher who was now returned what is the news  maam the little fellow with the squeaking voice has been telling me the whole story the other morning maam early he and the other were down the hill sweeping in paradiserow those chimnies they say are difficult and the square fellow maam the biggest of the two boys got wedged in the chimney the other little fellow was up at the top at the time and he heard the cry but in his fright and all he did not know what to do maam for he looked about from the top of the chimney and not a soul could he see stirring but a few that he could not make mind his screech the boy within almost stifling too so he screeched and screeched all he could and by the greatest chance in life maam old mr eden was just going down the hill to fetch his morning walk  aye interrupted mrs theresa friend ephraim is one of your early risers  well said marianne impatlently  so maam hearing the screech he turns and sees the sweep and the moment he understands the matter   i am sure he must have taken some time to understand it interposed mrs tattle for he is the slowest creature breathing and the deafest in company go on christopher so the sweep did make him hear  so he says maam and so the old gentleman went in and pulled the boy out of the chimney with much ado maam  bless me exclaimed mrs theresa but did old eden go up the chimney himself after the boy wig and all  why maam said christopher with a look of great delight that was all as one as the very dentical words i put to the boy myself when he telled me his story but maam that was what i could nt get out of him neither rightly for he is a churl the big boy that was stuck in the chimney i mean for when i put the question to him about the wig laughing like he would nt take it laughing like at all but would only make answer to us like a bear he saved my life that is all i know and this over again maam to all the kitchen round that crossquestioned him so when i finds him so stupid and illmannered like for i offered him a shilling maam myself to tell about the wig but he put it back in a ways that did not become such as he to no ladys butler maam whereupon i turns to the slim fellow and he is smarterer and more mannerly maam with a tongue in his head for his betters but he could not resolve me my question neither for he was up at the top of the chimney the best part of the time and when he came down mr eden had his wig on but had his arm all bare and bloody maam  poor mr eden exclaimed marianne  oh miss continued the servant and the chimneysweep himself was so bruised and must have been killed  well well but he is alive now go on with your story christopher said mrs t chimney sweepers get wedged in chimnies every day its part of their trade and its a happy thing when they come off with a few bruises to be sure added she observing that both frederick and marianne looked displeased at this speech to be sure if one may be lieve this story there was some real danger  real danger yes indeed said marianne and i am sure i think mr eden was very good  certainly it was a most commendable action and quite providential so i shall take an opportunity of saying when i tell the story in all companies and the boy may thank his kind stars i am sure to the end of his days for such an escape but pray christopher said she persisting in her conversation with christopher who was now laying the cloth for supper pray which house was it in paradiserow where the eagles or the miss ropers lodge or which  it was at my lady battersbys maam  ha ha cried mrs theresa i thought we should get to the bottom of the affair at last this is excellent this will make an admirable story for my lady battersby the next time i see her these quakers are so sly  old eden i know has long wanted to get himself introduced in that house and a charming charitable expedient he hit upon my lady battersby will enjoy this of all things   the mimic part iii now continued mrs theresa turning to frederick as soon as the servant had left the room now mr frederick montague i have a favor  such a favor to ask of you  its a favor which only you can grant you have such talents and would do the thing so admirably and my lady battersby would quite adore you for it she will do me the honor to be here to spend an evening tomorrow i am convinced mr and mrs montague will find themselves obliged to stay out another day and i so long to show you off to her ladyship and your doctor carbuncle and your counselor puff and your miss croker and all your charming characters you must let me introduce you to her ladyship tomorrow evening promise me   oh maam said frederick i cannot promise you any such thing indeed i am much obliged to you but i cannot come indeed  why not my dear sir why not you dont think i mean you should promise if you are certain your papa and mamma will be home  if they do come home i will ask them about it said frederick hesitating for though he by no means wished to accept of the invitation he had not yet acquired the necessary power of saying no decidedly  ask them repeated mrs theresa my dear sir at your age must you ask your papa and mamma about such things  must no maam said frederick but i said i would i know i need not because my father and mother always let me judge for myself about every thing almost  and about this i am sure cried marianne papa and mamma you know just as they were going away said if mrs theresa asks you to come do as you think best  well then said mrs theresa you know it rests with yourselves if you may do as you please  to be sure i may madam said frederick coloring from that species of emotion which is justly called false shame which often conquers real shame to be sure maam i may do as i please  then i may make sure of you said mrs theresa for now it would be down right rudeness to tell a lady you will not do as she pleases mr frederick montague i am sure is too well bred a young gentleman to do so impolite so ungallant a thing  the jarcon of politeness and gallantry is frequently brought by the silly acquaintance of young people to confuse their simple morality and clear good sense a new and unintelligible system is presented to them in a language foreign to their understanding and contradictory to their feelings they hesitate between new motives and old principles from the fear of being thought ignorant they become affected and from the dread of being thought to be children act like fools but all this they feel only when they are in the company of such people as mrs theresa tattle  maam frederick began i dont mean to be rude but i hope you will excuse me from coming to drink tea with you tomorrow because my father and mother are not acquainted with lady battersby and may be they might not like   take care take care said mrs theresa laughing at his perplexity you want to get off from obliging me and you dont know how you had very nearly made a most shocking blunder in putting it all upon poor lady battersby now you know its impossible mr and mrs montague could have in nature the slightest objection to my introducing you to my lady battersby at my own house for dont you know that besides her ladyships many unexceptionable qualities which one need not talk of she is cousin but once removed to the trotters of lancashire your mothers great favorites and there is not a person at the wells i will venture to say could be of more advantage to your sister sophy in the way of partners when she comes to go to the balls which it is to be supposed she will some time or other and as you are so good a brother that is a thing to be looked to you know besides as to yourself there is nothing her ladyship delights in so much as in a good mimic and she will quite adore you  but i dont want her to adore me maam said frederick bluntly then correcting himself added i mean for being a mimic  why not my love between friends can there be any harm in showing ones talents you that have such talents to show she will keep your secret i will answer for her and added she you need nt be afraid of her criticism for between you and i she is no great critic so you will come well thank you that is settled how you have made me beg and pray but you know your own value i see as you entertaining people always do one must ask a wit like a fine singer so often well but now for the favor i was going to ask you  frederick looked surprised for he thought that the favor of his company was what she meant but she explained herself farther  the old quaker who lodges above old ephraim eden my lady battersby and i have so much diversion about him he is the best character the oddest creature if you were but to see him come into the rooms with those stiff skirts or walking with his eternal sister birtha and his everlasting broad brimmed hat one knows him a mile off but then his voice and way and all together if one could get them to the life they would be better than any thing on the stage better even than any thing i have seen tonight and i think you would make a capital quaker for my lady battersby but then the thing is one can never get to hear the old quiz talk now you who have so much invention and cleverness i have no invention myself but could not you hit upon some way of getting to see him so that you might get him by heart i am sure you who are so quick would only want to see him and hear for half a minute to be able to take him off so as to kill one with laughing but i have no invention  oh as to the invention said frederick i know an admirable way of doing the thing if that was all but then remember i dont say i will do the thing for i will not but i know a way of getting up into his room and seeing him without his knowing i was there  o tell it me you charming clever creature  but remember i do not say i will do it  well well let us hear it and you shall do as you please afterward  merciful goodness exclaimed mrs tattle do my ears deceive me i declare i looked round and thought the squeaking chimney sweeper was in the room  so did i frederick i declare cried marianne laughing i never heard any thing so like his voice in my life  frederick imitated the squeaking voice of this chimney sweeper to great perfection  now continued he this fellow is just my height the old quaker if my face were blackened and if i were to change clothes with the chimney sweeper i will answer for it he would never know me  oh its an admirable invention i give you infinite credit for it exclaimed mrs theresa it shall it must be done i will ring and have the fellow up this minute  oh no do not ring said frederick stopping her hand i dont mean to do it you know you promised that i should do as i pleased i only told you my invention  well well but only let me ring and ask whether the chimney sweepers are below you shall do as you please afterward  christopher shut the door christopher said she to the servant who came up when she rang pray are the sweeps gone yet  no maam  but have they been up to old eden yet  oh no maam nor be not to go till the bell rings for miss birtha maam was asleep laying down and her brother would nt have her wakened on no account whatsomever he came down his self to the kitchen to the sweeps though but would nt have as i heard him say his sister waked for no account but miss birthas bell will ring when she wakens for the sweeps maam it was she wanted to see the boy as her brother saved and i suppose sent for em to give em something charitable maam  well never mind your suppositions said mrs theresa run down this very minute to the little squeaking chimney sweep and send him up to me quick but dont let the other bear come up with him  christopher who had curiosity as well as his mistress when he returned with the chimney sweeper prolonged his own stay in the room by sweeping the hearth throwing down the tongs and shovel and picking them up again  that will do christopher christopher that will do i say mrs theresa repeated in vain she was obliged to say christopher you may go before he would depart  now said she to frederick step in here to the next room with this candle and you will be equipped in an instant only just change clothes with the boy only just let me see what a charming chimney sweeper you would make you shall do as you please afterward  well i will only change clothes with him just to show you for one minute  but said marianne to mrs theresa whilst frederick was changing his clothes i think frederick is right about   about what love  i think he is in the right not to go up though he can do it so easily to see that gentleman i mean on purpose to mimic and laugh at him afterward i dont think that would be quite right  why pray miss marianne  why because he is so good natured to his sister he would not let her be wakened  dear its easy to be good in such little things and he will not have long to be good to her neither for i dont think she will trouble him long in this world any how  what do you mean said marianne  that she will die child  die die with that beautiful color in her cheeks how sorry her poor poor brother will be but she will not die i am sure for she walks about and runs up stairs so lightly o you must be quite entirely mistaken i hope  if i am mistaken dr panado cardimums mistaken too then that is my comfort he says unless the waters work a miracle she stands a bad chance and she will not follow my advice and consult the doctor for her health  he would frighten her to death perhaps said marianne i hope frederick will not go up to disturb her  lud child you are turned simpleton all of a sudden how can your brother disturb her more than the real chimney sweeper  but i dont think its right persisted marianne and i shall tell him so  nay miss marianne i dont commend you now young ladies should not be so forward to give opinions and advice to their elder brothers unasked and mr frederick and i i presume must know what is right as well as miss marianne hush here he is o the capital figure cried mrs theresa bravo bravo cried she as frederick entered in the chimney sweepers dress and as he spoke saying  i am afraid please your ladyship to dirty your ladyships carpet  she broke out into immoderate raptures calling him her charming chimney sweeper and repeating that she knew before hand the character would do for him  she instantly rung the bell in spite of all expostulation  ordered christopher to send up the other chimney sweeper  triumphed in observing that christopher did not in the least know frederick when he came into the room and offered to lay any wager that the other chimney sweeper would mistake him for his companion  and so he did and when frederick spoke the voice was so very like that it was scarcely possible that he should have perceived the difference  marianne was diverted by this scene but she started when in the midst of it they heard a bell ring  that is the ladys bell and we must go said the blunt chimney sweeper  go then about your business and here is a shilling for you to drink my honest fellow i did not know you were so much bruised when i first saw you  i will not detain you go said she pushing frederick toward the door  marianne sprang forward to speak to him but mrs theresa kept her off and though frederick resisted the lady shut the door upon him by superior force and having locked it there was no retreat  mrs tattle and marianne waited impatiently for fredericks return  i hear them cried marianne i hear them coming down stairs  they listened again and all was silent  at length they heard suddenly a great noise of many steps and many voices in confusion in the hall  merciful exclaimed mrs theresa it must be your father and mother come back  marianne ran to unlock the room door and mrs theresa followed her into the hall  the hall was rather dark but under the lamp a crowd of people all the servants in the house were gathered together  as mrs theresa approached the crowd opened in silence and she beheld in the midst frederick blood streaming from his face his head was held by christopher and the chimney sweeper was holding a basin for him  merciful gracious heaven what will become of me exclaimed mrs theresa bleeding good god he will bleed to death can nobody think of any thing that will stop blood in a minute a key  a large key down his back a key  has nobody a key mr and mrs montague will be here before he has done bleeding a key cobwebs a puffball for mercys sake can nobody think of any thing that will stop blood in a minute gracious me he will bleed to death i believe  he will bleed to death o my brother cried marianne catching hold of the words and terrified she ran up stairs crying sophy o sophy come down this minute or he will be dead my brothers bleeding to death  sophy sophy come down or he will be dead  let go the basin you said christopher pulling the basin out of the chimney sweepers hand who had all this time stood in silence you are not fit to hold the basin for a gentleman  let him hold it said frederick he did not mean to hurt me  that is more than he deserves i am certain sure he might have known well enough it was mr frederick all the time and he would no business to go to fight  such a one as he with a gentleman  i did not know he was a gentleman said the chimney sweeper how could i  how could he indeed said frederick he shall hold the basin  gracious me i am glad to hear him speak like himself again at any rate cried mrs theresa lord bless us and here comes miss sophy too  sophy cried frederick oh sophy dont you come  dont look at me you will despise me  my brother where where said sophy looking as she thought at the two chimney sweepers  its frederick said marianne that is my brother  miss sophy dont be alarmed mrs theresa began but gracious goodness i wish miss birtha   at this instant a female figure in white appeared upon the stairs she passed swiftly on whilst every one gave way before her  oh miss birtha cried mrs theresa catching hold of her gown to stop her as she came near frederick oh miss eden your beautiful india muslin  take care of the chimney sweeper for heavens sake  but she pressed forwards  its my brother will he die cried marianne throwing her arms round her and looking up as if to a being of a superior order will he bleed to death  no my love answered a sweet voice do not frighten thyself  i have done bleeding said frederick  dear me miss marianne if you would not make such a rout cried mrs tattle miss birtha its nothing but a frolic you see mr frederick montague only in a masquerade dress nothing in the world but a frolic maam you see he stops bleeding i was frightened out of my wits at first i thought it was his eye but i see it is only his nose all is well that ends well mr frederick well keep your counsel pray maam let us ask no questions its only a boyish frolic come mr frederick this way into my room and i will give you a towel and some clean water and you can get rid of this masquerade dress make haste for fear your father and mother should pop in upon us  do not be afraid of thy father and mother they are surely thy best friends said a mild voice it was the voice of an elderly gentleman who now stood behind frederick  oh sir oh mr eden said frederick turning to him   dont betray me for goodness sake say nothing about me whispered mrs tattle  i am not thinking about you  let me speak cried he pushing away her hand which stopped his mouth i shall say nothing about you i promise you said frederick with a look of contempt  no but for your own sake my dear sir your papa and mamma bless me is not that mrs montagues carriage  my brother maam said sophy is not afraid of my father and mothers coming back let him speak  he was going to speak the truth  to be sure miss sophy i would nt hinder him from speaking the truth but its not proper i presume maam to speak truth at all times and in all places and before every body servants and all i only wanted maam to hinder your brother from exposing himself a hall i apprehend is not a proper place for explanations  here said mr eden opening the door of his room which was on the opposite side of the hall to mrs tattles here is a place said he to frederick where thou may speak the truth at all times and before every body  nay my rooms at mr frederick montagues service and my doors open too this way pray said she pulling his arm  but frederick broke from her and followed mr eden  oh sir will you forgive me cried he  forgive thee  and what have i to forgive  forgive brother without asking what said birtha smiling  he shall know all cried frederick all that concerns myself i mean sir i disguised myself in this dress i came up to your room tonight on purpose to see you without your knowing it that i might mimic you the chimney sweeper  where is he said frederick looking round and he ran into the hall to see for him  may he come in he may  he is a brave an honest good grateful boy he never guessed who i was after we left you we went down to the kitchen together and there i fool that i was for the pleasure of making mr christopher and the servants laugh began to mimic you this boy said he would not stand by and hear you laughed at  that you had saved his life  that i ought to be ashamed of myself  that you had just given me halfacrown  and so you had  but i went on and told him i would knock him down if he said another word  he did  i gave the first blow  we fought  i came to the ground  the servants pulled me up again  they found out i dont know how that i was not a chimney sweeper  the rest you saw and now can you forgive me sir said frederick to mr eden seizing hold of his hand  the other hand friend said the quaker gently withdrawing his right hand which every body now observed being much swelled he put it in his bosom again  this hand and welcome said he offering his other hand to frederick and shaking his with a smile  o that other hand said frederick that was hurt i remember  how ill i have behaved  extremely ill  but this is a lesson that i shall never forget as long as i live i hope for the future i shall behave like a gentleman  and like a man  and like a good man i am sure thou will said the good quaker shaking fredericks hand affectionately or i am much mistaken friend in that black countenance  you are not mistaken cried marianne frederick will never be persuaded again by any body to do what he does not think right and now brother you may wash your black countenance  just when frederick had got rid of half his black countenance a double knock was heard at the door it was mr and mrs montague  who went into the hall to meet them  what will you do now whispered mrs theresa to frederick as his father and mother came into the room  a chimney sweeper covered with blood exclaimed mr and mrs montague  father i am frederick said he stepping forward toward them as they stood in astonishment  frederick my son  yes mother i am not hurt half so much as i deserve i will tell you    nay interrupted birtha let my brother tell the story this time thou have told it once and told it well  no one but my brother could tell it better  a story never tells so well the second time to be sure said mrs theresa but mr eden will certainly make the best of it  without taking any notice of mrs tattle or her apprehensive looks mr eden explained all that he knew of the affair in a few words your son concluded he will quickly put off this dirty dress  the dress has not stained the mind  that is fair and honorable when he felt himself in the wrong he said so nor was he in haste to conceal his adventure from his father this made me think well of both father and son i speak plainly friend for that is best but what is become of the other chimney sweeper he will want to go home said mr eden turning to mrs theresa  without making any reply she hurried out of the room as fast as possible and returned in a few moments with a look of extreme consternation  good heaven here is a catastrophe indeed  now indeed mr frederick your papa and mamma have reason to be angry a new suit of clothes  the barefaced villain  gone  no sign of them in my closet or any where  the door was locked  he must have gone up the chimney out upon the leads and so escaped but christopher is after him i protest mrs montague you take it too quietly  the wretch  a new suit of clothes blue coat and buff waistcoat  i never heard of such a thing  i declare mr montague you are vastly good now not to be in a passion added mrs theresa  madam replied mr montague with a look of much civil contempt i think the loss of a suit of clothes and even the disgrace that my son has been brought to this evening fortunate circumstances in his education he will i am persuaded judge and act for himself more wisely in future nor will he be tempted to offend against humanity for the sake of being called the best mimic in the world  end of vol ii
