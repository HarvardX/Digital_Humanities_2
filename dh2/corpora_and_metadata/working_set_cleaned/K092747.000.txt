curiosities of literature  curiosities of literature  consisting of anecdotes characters sketches and observations literary critical and historical  indocti discant ament meminisse periti horace content if here the unlearned their wants may view the learned reflect on what before they knew pope london printed for j murray no    fleet street mdccxci  preface the present volume pretends to no other merit than that of being a laborious selection of the most interesting parts of the various ana to these valuable stores of literature i have added some anecdotes which appeared to me amusive and curious and some observations which i hope will not be deemed impertinent  the ana form a body of literature not universally known it may therefore be useful to inform the reader that in the early part of the last century it was prevailing custom to take down for publication the conversations or  tabletalk as they have been sometimes called of the most eminent wits and scholars to satisfy the demands of famine rather than those of literature some men were prompted to sell their collections to the booksellers and it may be fairly presumed were less attentive to the richness of the materials then to the number of pages they were calculated to fill others published them at the death of a valued friend to display the extent of his science or the felicity of his genius and it must be confessed that even these were not so scrupulous as they should have been of what they admitted into their collections  had such repositories of literature been judiciously formed they would have proved a valuable acquisition to the republic of letters but their respective compilers have evinced great inattention or little discernment nothing was discriminated in the mass of their materials they appear to have listened to the mouth of the scholar whose sentiments they record as the credulous enthusiast did in ancient times to the oracle he worshipped thus whatever was unintelligible obscure or even false was held by these literary devotees in as great reverence as it is opposite  it has been repeatedly urged and allowed that the matter of elaborate treatises and even ponderous volumes may not infrequently be comprised in concise essays or short remarks some things of this kind are attempted in the present volume and i have been prompted toward it is publication by a conviction that it will furnish much useful information to the generality of readers  it is not just however that curiosity should be raised too high if expectations are formed which are impossible to be gratified abilities infinitely superior to mine must be humbled all the anecdotes i offer will not be new of some i pretend only to remind the reader but the greater part i have frequently been tempted to believe will appear interesting  the fashionable and commercial world are too much occupied to attend to serious discussion and scientific research the one laboriously occupied in doing nothing and the other indefatigable in doing every thing to the literary labourer they leave the cultivation of the fields and the gardens of literature they are willing to purchase the productions of his talents but they expect to receive only the fruits and the flowers to such who form indeed the generality of readers it is presumed the present collection will not be found unuseful whatever is most interesting in books rarely to be met with or whatever is most agreeable in compilations which it would be impossible for them to peruse with patience is here selected and if it is not presumptuous to add the man of letters at the same time may be reminded of important observations striking anecdotes and attic pleasantries which however they deserve to be retained will without some vade mecum of this kind soon escape from the most tenacious memory in a word if this collection answers the hopes of the editor it will be found a miscellany not unamusive to the literary lounger  as i have acknowledged that this volume contains for the most part only a collection from the works of others some aristarchus may sagaciously discover that it is not difficult to make books in this manner with this i shall agree but it will be admitted that it has cost some care and some labor to collect these materials should the useful and the agreeable be found blended i believe the public care little whether the author has written every sentence himself or like me stands deeply indebted to the works of other writers  to improve an arrangement which is not always so perfect as i could wish i have added a copious index each article also is titled so that wherever the book is opened the subject discussed immediately appears  to be useful and to please the public is my design my work is not adapted to extend or to bestow reputation it is sufficient if it attains it is humble pretension a multifarious collection of this kind stands in great need of critical candor yet i should feel myself little solicitous concerning it is reception if i were certain that the urbanity of the critic was to dicide it is fate  the editor  contents literature and criticism the persecuted learned

there existed antipodes boniface archbishop of mayence the popes legate declared him a heretic and consigned him to the flames  galileo because he believed in the copernican system now universally established was condemned at rome publicly to disavow sentiments the truth of which must have been to him abundantly manifest  the most valued of gabriel naudes works is his apology for those great men who have been accused of magic in that book he has recorded a melancholy number of the most eminent scholars who have found that to have been successful in their studies was a success which harrassed them with a continued persecution that sometimes led them into the prison and sometimes bound them to the stake  urbe grandier for whose life replete with interesting anecdote i refer the reader to bail was burnt alive through the machinations of a rival who formed a conspiracy against this amiable and unfortunate scholar by contriving to get the depositions of some nuns to prove the crime of magic these women must have been guilty of the most horrid perjuries  cornelius agrippa was necessitated to fly his country and the enjoyments of a rich income merely for having displayed a few philosophical experiments which now every schoolboy can perform the people beheld him as an object of horror and not infrequently when he walked the streets he found them empty at his approach he died of disease and famine in an hospital  in the present day when the lights of philosophy have become so generally expanded we perceive the little foundation of all these accusations of magic what a dreadful chain must there have been of perjuries and conspiracies one is willing to imagine for the honor of human nature that so deep a malignity and so sedate a cruelty could not have tainted the heart of men but the simple recital of history forms too often the severest satire on human nature  our great roger bacon by a degree of penetration which perhaps has never been equalled discovered some of the most occult secrets in nature she seems indeed  if i may so express myself  to have stood naked before him his honors have been stolen from him by more modern authors who have appeared inventors when they were copying bacon yet for the reward of all his intense studies the holy brethren and the infallible majesty of rome occasioned him to languish in prison during the greater part of his life  the catalogue of the persecuted learned is indeed voluminous we need not waste our tears on fictitious sorrows while the remembrance of these men shall exist  friar bacon my zeal for the memory of this illustrious scholar impels me to transcribe which it will be found i seldom do from a book that is in every bodys hands from the faithful and laborious henry have i collected what follows concerning roger bacon    we cannot but lament that friar bacon met with so many discouragements in the pursuit of useful knowledge if he had lived in better times or if he had even been permitted to prosecute that course of enquiries and experiments in which he engaged after his return from paris it is highly probable that the world would have many valuable discoveries that are still unknown   an excellent modern writer dr friend having enumerated some of bacons discoveries adds  these are wonderful discoveries for a man to make in so ignorant an age who had no master to teach him but struck it all out of his own brain but it is still more wonderful that such discoveries should lie so long concealed till in the next succeeding centuries other people should start up and lay claim to those very inventions to which bacon alone had a right   bacon discovered the art of making readingglasses the camera obscura microscopes telescopes and various other mathematical and astronomical instruments he discovered a method of performing all the chemical operations that are now in use he combined the mechanical powers in so wonderful a manner that it was for this he was accused of magic his discoveries in medicine were by no means unimportant that the ingredients of gunpowder and the art of making it were well known to him is now undeniable but the humane philosopher dreading the consequences of communicating this discovery to the world transposed the letters of the latin words which signify charcoal which made the whole obscure it was done thus  luru mope can vbre  carbonum pulvere by this means he rendered it difficult to discover this dangerous secret by the perusal of his works and at the same time secured to himself the honor of having known it by specifying the other ingredients if it should be discovered by any other person this accordingly happened after bacons death for about the beginning of the fourteenth century one barthold schwartz a german monk and chemist accidentally discovered gunpowder as he was pounding saltpetre sulphur and charcoal in a mortar for some other purpose  to this we may add that the chinese employed gunpowder in their wars and were familiar with the art of printing probably some centuries before we made use of them in europe  though bacon is mentioned in this artical as the inventor of optical glasses marville gives a curious piece of information he says that it is generally known that james metius a dutchman invented in   0  spectacles and telescopes and that galileo being at venice imitated as well as he could a telescope and astonished the learned venetians from the tower of st mark with this novel invention and he adds  but there are few who know that the principles of optics on which telescopes are formed are to be found in euclid and in the ancient geometricians and that it is through want of reflection that this wonderful invention as well as many others have remained so long concealed in the majesty of nature as pliny expresses it till chance has drawn them out  the recovery of manuscripts it was a florentine who found buried in a heap of dust and in a rotten coffer belonging to the monastery of saint gal the works of quintilian and by this fortunate discovery gave them to the republic of letters  papirius masson found in the house of a bookbinder of lions the works of agobart the mechanic was on the point of using the manuscripts to line the covers of his books  raimond soranzo a celebrated lawyer in the papal court at avignon about the middle of the fourteenth century had in his possession the two books of cicero on glory he made a present of them to petrarch who lent them to an aged and poor man of letters formerly his preceptor urged by extreme poverty the old man pawned them and returning home died suddenly without having revealed where he had left them since which time they have never been recovered  leonard aretin was one of the most distinguished scholars at the dawn of literature but he has done that which reflects on him great dishonor he found a greek manuscript of procopius de bello gothico this he translated into latin and published the work as his own since however other manuscripts of the same work have been discovered and the fraud of leonard aretin is apparent  machiavel acted more adroitly in a similar case a manuscript of the apophthegms of the ancients by plutarch having fallen into his hands he selected those which pleased him and put them into the mouth of one of his heroes  a page of the second decade of livy was found by a man of letters on the parchment of his battledore as he was amusing himself in the country he ran directly to the maker of the battledore but arrived too late the man had finished the last page of livy in completing a large order for these articles about a week before  sir robert cotton being one day at his tailors discovered that the man held in his hand ready to be cut up for measures the original magna charta with all it is appendages of seals and signatures he bought this singular curiosity for a trifle and recovered in this manner what had long been given over for lost  as this anecdote is entirely new to me it may be proper to point out that it is taken from the colomesiana page      whether the poems of rowley be originals adulterations or the compositions of chatterton i do not venture to decide this however is certain that the finding them in the wormeaten chest in the ancient church at bristol has a very classical appearance and is undoubtedly in the nature of such discoveries it is not probable  for he was i believe ignorant of the french language  that poor chatterton like me had labored through all the ana and caught the idea from their perusal  we might be inclined to forgive a skilful forgery of the two books of cicero on glory they must have been very important and curious for no man was more enthusiastically fond of glory than this orator petrarch speaks of them with ecstasy and informs us that he studied them perpetually  sketches of criticism yes should great homer lift his aweful head zoilus again would start up from the dead the greatest authors of antiquity have smarted under the lash of criticism chevrau has collected a great number of instances lest i should prove tedious i only select a few  it was given out that homer had stolen from hesiod whatever was most remarkable in the iliad and odyssey the emperor caligula suppressed the works of this great poet and gave for reason that he certainly had as much right as plato who had so severely condemned him  sophocles was brought to trial by his children as a lunatic and some who blamed the inequalities of this poet have also condemned the vanity of pindar the hard and rough verses of aeschylus and the manner in which euripides conducted his plots  socrates who has even been compared to jesus christ as the wisest and the most moral of men cicero has treated as an usurer and athenaeus as an illiterate person mr cumberland in one of his observers has industriously revived a calumny which most assuredly only took it is rise from the malignant buffoonery of aristophanes who as jortin says was a great wit but a great rascal should some future author draw his anecdotes from the writings of foot or of peter pindar we know well that he might delineate a spirited character but nothing at the same time would be more fictitious  plato who has been called by clement of alexandria the moses of athens the philosopher of the christians by arnobius and the god of philosophers by cicero has undergone a variety of criticisms athenaeus accuses him of envy theopompus of lying suidas of avarice aulus gellius of robbery porphyry of incontinence and aristophanes of impiety  aristotle who according to some writers has composed more than four hundred volumes and who for his work on animals received from alexander eight hundred talents has not been less spared by the critics diogenes laertius cicero and plutarch have forgotten nothing that can tend to show his ignorance his ambition and his vanity  if the reader does not feel himself weary he may read on  virgil is destitute of invention if we are to give credit to pliny carbilius and seneca caligula has absolutely denied him even mediocrity herennus has marked his faults and perilius faustinus has furnished a thick volume with his plagiarisms even the author of his apology has confessed that he has stolen from homer his greatest beauties  horace censures the coarse humor of plautus and horace in his turn has been blamed for fiction and obscurity  the majority of the critics regard plinys history only as a pleasing romance and seem to have quite as little respect for quintus curtius  pliny cannot bear diodorus and vopiscus and in one comprehensive criticism treats all the historians as narrators of fables  livy has been reproached for his aversion to the gauls dion for his hatred of the republic velleius paterculus for speaking too kindly of the vices of tiberius and herodotus and plutarch for their excessive partiality to their own country others have said of cicero that there is no connection and to adopt their own figure no blood and nerves in what his admirers so warmly extol they say he is cold in his extemporaneous effusions too artificial in his exordiums trifling in his strained witticisms and tiresome in his digressions  quintilian does not spare seneca and demosthenes called by cicero the prince of orators has according to hermippus more of art than of nature to demades his orations appear too much labored others have thought him too dry and if we may trust eschines his language is by no means pure  should we proceed with this list to our own country and our own times it might be curiously augmented but perhaps enough has been said to soothe irritated genius and to shame fastidious criticism i would beg the critics to remember the earl of roscommon writes in his preface to his version of horaces art of poetry that horace owed his favor and his fortune to the character given of him by virgil and varius that fundanius and pollio are still valued by what horace says of them and that in their golden age there was a good understanding among the ingenious and those who were the most esteemed were the bestnatured i would hope in spite of the daily cries we hear from disappointed writers that those journalists whose style and sentiments render them respectable in the eyes of every man of letters maintain with rigid integrity the fountains of criticism pure and incorrupt they cannot be insensible that their volumes are not merely read and then forgotten but that they will remain as surviving witnesses for or against them from century to century  be thou the first true merit to befriend his praise is lost who waits till all commend tartarian libraries cardinal perron in the perroniana has the following curious article of intelligence in that part of tartary which belongs to the kingdom of persia there exists a flourishing university where the arabs cultivate literature gioan baptista remondi who was the first who caused books in the arabic language to be printed in europe and who had even studied in this university has pretended to say that there were a number of arabic books translated from many greek authors who remain unknown to the europeans it was the arabians who have preserved a book of archimedes with many authors who have written on mathematics such as apollonius pergeaeus and even aristotle hippocrates and galen  to this account may be added that which bell has given us in his travels to tartary it is  that in siberia there exists an uncommon library the rooms of which are filled with scrolls of glazed paper fairly wrote and many of them in gilt characters the language in which they are written is that of the tongusts or calmucs perhaps he adds they may contain some valuable pieces of antiquity particularly ancient history  at mount athos mr andrews in his anecdotes informs us that travelers agree there are several monasteries with libraries full of books which are illegible to those holy brotherhoods but whose contents are probably well worth inspection  every captain who can write his own logbook has of late obtruded his discoveries of every ten yards of land he has happened to observe and worked up into pathos his account of storms and short provisions if they would in their voyages endeavor to bring some information or some materials of this kind to europe a new source of knowledge would be opened to our contemplation many books which are now lost might probably be recovered science might be enlarged and amusement gratified  the bibliomania should ever the idea thrown out in the last article be put into practice the learned must be careful in their zeal of not becoming the dupes of the artful illiterate the present anecdote may serve as a beacon  the bibliomania or the collecting an enormous heap of books has long been the rage with some who would fain pass themselves upon us for men of vast erudition some indulging this luxury of literature desirous of forming an immense and curious library have scoured all europe and sent out travelers to the indies to discover ancient books or scarce manuscripts this has occasioned many cheats and impositions toward the end of the last century some ignorant or knavish men sent to paris a number of arabic manuscripts in excellent condition and clear characters they were received with all imaginable respect by the eager collectors of books they were rapidly purchased at a high price but lo when they were examined by the connoisseurs these manuscripts which were held so inestimable were discovered to be books of accounts and registers cleanly transcribed by certain arabian merchants  risum teneatis amici  a similar imposition was practiced on the great peiresc it was reported that the ethiopians were in possession of a book written by enoch many literati in europe had long ardently desired to inspect it as they imagined it would contain many valuable secrets and unknown histories upon this some impostor having got an ethiopic book into his hands he wrote for the title  the prophecies and history of enoch upon the front page m peiresc no sooner heard of it than he purchased it of the impostor for a considerable sum of money being afterward placed in cardinal mazarines library there ludolf famous for his skill in ethiopic literature had access to it when lo this history of enoch was discovered to be nothing more than a gnostic treatise upon the mysteries of heaven and earth but which did not mention one word concerning enoch  the turks charpentier in the carpenteriana says that the turks whom the vulgar literati regard as having neglected the sciences and literature in general have many particular and general histories from osman the first of their emperors to the present in the library of the king of france there are a number of these historians none have yet been translated but the annals of leunclavius which however are not very considerable the library of the great turk forms a part of his treasures and there are historians paid by him who record with care and accuracy the actions and the conquests of their princes  there are colleges established at constantinople where the alcoran the mathematics and rhetoric are taught but it is principally at cairo where there are a multitude of scholars who live by transcribing books as once was practiced in the university of paris where the scribes assembled sometimes to the number of twenty or thirty thousand the invention of the art of printing having deprived them of the means of subsistence they have disappeared it is to prevent the same inconvenience that printing is prohibited throughout the ottoman empire  when a jew who was a famous dutch printer brought to constantinople printingpresses etc to introduce the art of printing in that city the vizir caused him to be hanged declaring that it would be a great cruelty that one man should enrich himself by taking the bread of eleven thousand scribes who gained their living by their pen  the portraits of authors with the ancients it was undoubtedly a custom to place the portraits of authors before their works martial will serve as a testimony in this case the hundred and eightysixth epigram of his fourteenth book is a mere play on words concerning a little volume which contained the works of virgil and which had his portrait prefixed to it the volume and the characters must have been very diminutive antiquity records many such penmen whose glory consisted in writing in so small a hand that it was not legible to the naked eye one wrote a verse of homer on a grain of millet and another more trifling and indefatigable transcribed the whole iliad in so consined a space that it could be enclosed in a nut shell menage says that these things are not so improbable as they seem this trifling art is not lost in modern times he says he has read whole sentences which were not perceptible to the eye without the assistance of the microscope he has even seen portraits and pictures of the same kind and which seems wonderful what appeared lines and scratches thrown down at random were letters in capitals and the lineaments of madame la dauphines face were preserved with the most pleasing delicacy and with correctness of resemblance he read also an italian poem in praise of this princess which contained some thousands of verses i transcribe his words it was written by an officer in a space of a foot and a half  martial is not the only writer who takes notice of the ancients prefixing their portraits to their works seneca in his ninth chapter on the tranquillity of the soul complains of many of the luxurious great who  like so many of our own  possessed libraries as they do their estates and equipages it is melancholy to observe he continues how the portraits of men of genius and the works of their divine intelligence but serve as the luxury and the ornaments of their walls  pliny has nearly the same observation lib xxxv cap   he remarks that the custom was rather modern in his time and attributes to asinius pollio the honor of having introduced it into rome in consecrating he says a library with the portraits of our illustrious authors you have formed if i may so express myself a republic of the intellectual powers of men  criticism early after the reestablishment of letters huet writes criticism formed the chief occupation of those who applied themselves to their cultivation this was very necessary after so many ages of ignorance they were obliged if we may so express ourselves to disperse the dust to efface the moldy spots and to kill the worms that gnawed and disfigured those manuscripts which had escaped the fury of the barbarians and the depredations of time  it was thus the art of criticism flourished in all it is vigor and was distinguished by it is useful labors during two centuries the supreme degree of erudition consisted in bringing to light the ancient authors in the correction of the errors of the scribes through whose hands they had passed either by collating them with the best copies or exerting their own judgment and learning to the restoring of those passages which were evidently corrupt at length this avocation degenerated into a low and obscure study the chief merit of which consisted in the recovery and collation of the best manuscripts this was the employment of gruter during his whole life those to whom these assistances failed employed their critical acumen and literature to give the ancient writers in all their purity but not infrequently they dismembered that which before was entire and occasioned an infinity of labors to the critics their successors who were somewhat more judicious than themselves in restoring the passages to their original state and in healing those wounds and unmerciful lacerations which they had undergone  amongst these latter critics casaubon salmasius and gronovius hold distinguished rank  now that the best authors are no more scarce but multiplied without end by the invention of printing verbal criticism the chief merit of which is to catch syllables deserves no longer our esteem critics of this kind may not unaptly be compared to weeders they eradicate the worthless plants and leave to more skilful cultivators the art of gathering and distinguishing the more valuable ones  on the phrase  the law and the prophets saint jerome and the other fathers of the church call the five books of moses the law because of deuteronomy and the books of the prophets or their prophecics the prophets all the other books are called holy writings hence the phrase of the law and the prophets is so frequently made use of in the new testament and in the writings of the fathers  the six follies of science nothing is so capable of disordering the intellects as an intense application to one of these six things the quadrature of the circle the multiplication of the cube the perpetual motion the philosophical stone magic and judicial astrology while we are young we may exercise our imagination on these curious topics merely to convince us of their impossibility but it shows a great defect in judgment to be occupied on them in an advanced age it is proper however fontenelle remarks to apply ones self to these enquiries because we find as we proceed many valuable discoveries of which we were before ignorant the same thought cowley has applied in an address to his mistress thus  although i think thou never wilt be found yet i am resolved to search for thee the search itself rewards the pains so though the chemist his great secret miss for neither it in art nor nature is yet things well worth his toil he gains and does his charge and labor pay with good unsought experiments by the way   the same thought is in done perhaps cowley did not suspect that he was an imitator what is certain fontenelle could not have read either and perhaps only struck out the thought by his own reflection  the republic of letters in the present article i am little more than the translator of the lively and ingenious vigneul marville  the republic of letters is of an ancient date it appears by the pillars josephus has noticed on which were engraven the principles of the sciences that this republic existed before the deluge at least it cannot be denied that soon after this great catastrophe the sciences flourished  never was a republic greater better peopled more free or more glorious it is spread on the face of the earth and is composed of persons of every nation of every rank of every age and of both sexes they are intimately acquainted with every language the dead as well as the living to the cultivation of letters they join that of the arts and the mechanics are also permitted to occupy a place but their religion cannot boast of uniformity and their manners like those of every other republic form a mixture of good and of evil they are sometimes enthusiastically pious and sometimes insanely impious  the politics of this state consist rather in words in vague maxims and ingenious reflections than in actions or their effects this people owe all their strength to the brilliancy of their eloquence and the solidity of their arguments their trade is perfectly intellectual and their riches very moderate they live in one continued strife for glory and for immortality their dress is by no means splendid yet they affect to despise those who labor through the impulse of avarice or necessity  they are divided into many sects and they seem to multiply every day the state is shared between the philosophers the physicians the divines the lawyers the historians the mathematicians the orators the grammarians and the poets who have each their respective laws  justice is administered by the critics frequently with more severity than justice the people groan under the tyranny of these governors particularly when they are capricious and visionary they rescind they erase or add at their will and pleasure much in the manner of the grand monarque  car tell est notre plaisir and no author can answer for his fate when once he is fairly in their hands some of these are so unfortunate that through the cruelty of the treatment they receive they lose not only their temper but their sense and wits  shame is the great castigation of the guilty and to lose ones reputation among this people is to lose ones life there exist however but too many impudent swindlers who prey upon the property of others and many a vile spunger who snatches the bread from the hands of men of merit  the public are the distributors of glory but too often the distribution is made with blindness or undiscerning precipitation it is this which causes loud complaints and excites such murmurs throughout the republic  the predominating vices of this state are presumption vanity pride jealousy and calumny there is also a distemper peculiar to the inhabitants which is denominated hunger and which occasions frequent desolations throughout the country  this republic too has the misfortune to be infected with numerous plagiarists a species of banditti who rifle the passengers the corruptors of books and the forgers are not less formidable nor do there want impostors who form rhapsodies and bestow pompous titles on unimportant trifles who levy heavy contributions on the public  there are also found an infinite number of illustrious idlers and voluptuaries who only seeking for those volumes that afford amusement draw all their subsistence from the state without contributing any thing either to it is advantage or it is glory there are also misanthropes born with an hatred of men pedants who are the terror of schoolboys and the enemies of urbanity and amiable manners  i will not notice the licentious geniuses of the republic who are in an eternal hostility of sentiments and a warfare of disputes nor those fastidious minds who are too delicate not to be offended every moment nor those visionaries who load their imagination with crude and false systems  all these may be supposed to exist in a republic so vast as that of letters where it is permitted to every one to reside and to live according to his own inclinations  esdras it was esdras who wrote what is at the conclusion of the books of moses which as the death of the latter is there mentioned shows he could not have been the author he also at the return from the babylonish captivity arranged into one body the scriptures and many assure us on the authority of the ancients that he corrected it in eighteen passages which had been greatly altered and falsified is there not reason to fear that he still has left so much to correct that the body of writings which pass under the name of the holy scriptures is little entitled to that sacred appellation it is corruptions and errors are at least evident hobbes perfectly discredits moses being the author of the pentateuch in his leviathan it appears that moses delivered to joshua some materials which he deposited in the ark that joshua gave them to the judges or elders and that in the course of time they took the arrangement in which they now appear  to this article we may add that it is well known to those who are most intelligent in biblical literature that a great number of books of the old testament are lost some have affirmed that we are deprived of more than we possess it is agreed that there are lost a book of the chronicles of the kings of judah the third epistle to the corinthians and the third epistle of peter samuel wrote a book on the office and instruction of a king solomon compiled a work containing three thousand parables and five thousand and ninety songs and some treatises on the nature of trees plants and herbs from the cedar to the hyssop which are also lost  aristotle of all men of letters who have appeared perhaps there never was one on whom so much praise and so much censure have been lavished as on aristotle but he had this advantage of which some of the most eminent scholars have been deprived that he enjoyed during his life a splendid reputation philip of macedon must have felt a strong conviction of his merit when he wrote to him in these terms on the occasion of the birth of alexander i receive from the gods this day a son but i thank them not so much for the favor of his birth as his having come into the world in a time when you can have the care of his education and that through you he will be rendered worthy of being my son  gregory vii it is a strong trait in the character of the piety of pope gregory the seventh that he caused the greater part of the most finished compositions of the ancients to be destroyed doubtless because the authors of them were pagans it was this pope who burnt the works of varro the learned roman that st augustine should not be accused of plagiarism for this saint owes to the labors of varro his books of the city of god  curious scholastic disquisitions amongst the subjects for the disquisitions of the learned in the eleventh century were the following ones of the substantial form of sounds  of the essence of universals  the following question was a favorite topic and after having been discussed by thousands of the acutest logicians through the course of a whole century with all the rash dexterity of wit remained unresolved  when a hog is carried to market with a rope tied about it is neck which is held at the other end by a man whether is the hog carried to market by the rope or by the man  taste it is in vain to account for the operations of taste it is surely an unsubstantial form a shadow which may be seen but not grasped it is mutations too are wonderful i am at a loss to account on what principles the present instance took place vigneul marville supplies me with this anecdote   brebeuf when he was young felt an enthusiastic inclination for the works of horace his friend gautier on the contrary was infected with a taste for lucan this preference frequently occasioned disputes to terminate them it was agreed that each of them should read the favorite poet of his friend that they should examine with critical acumen and decree with candor the consequences are singular gautier read horace became enamoured of his verses and never after quitted them while brebeuf was so charmed with lucan that he grew intoxicated with the pharsalia and in translating this epic outlucand lucan himself in his bombastic and tumid verses  that gautier should reject lucan after a studious perusal of horace is not surprising the wonder is how brebeuf could forget so suddenly the graces and the rules of his master horace to give into lucans corrupted taste  mr burke in his elegant essay on the sublime and beautiful says that what is called taste in it is most general acceptance is not a simple idea but is partly made up of a perception of the primary pleasures of sense of the secondary pleasures of the imagination and of the conclusions of the reasoning faculty concerning the various relations of these and concerning the human passions manners and actions all these are requisite to form taste and the groundwork of all these is the same in the human mind for as the senses are the great originals of all our ideas and consequently of all our pleasures if they are not uncertain and arbitrary the whole groundwork of taste is common to all and therefore there is a sufficient foundation for a conclusive reasoning for these matters  in another place he observes   sensibility and judgment which are the qualities that compose what is commonly called a taste vary exceedingly in various people from a defect in the former of these qualities arises a want of taste a weakness in the latter constitutes a wrong or a bad one  if this account is just the sensibility and the judgment of brebeuf of which the one was so lively and the other so vigorous when in his youthful days he was attached to horace must have undergone a total change when he became studiously fond of lucan yet this is not to be conceived for it is possible to enlarge and to strengthen our judgment but surely not to eradicate a correct one at least when a man is in the vigor of life and health  imitators there are some writers and in general they will be found to be pedants who imagine they can supply by the labors of industry the deficiencies of nature it is recorded of paulus manutius that he frequently spent a month in writing a single letter he affected to imitate cicero the consequences are that he has attained to something of the elegance of his style but he is still destitute of the native graces of a flowing and unaffected composition  may not such writers be said to create beautiful forms without the power of bestowing on them animation  some are very proud in the imitation of their illustrious predecessors but in general their abilities only reach to the imitation of their defects as the courtiers of alexander who were incapable of imitating his heroism could mimic his deformity  cicero i should says menage have received a great pleasure to have conversed with cicero had i lived in his time he must have been a man very agreeable in conversation since even caesar carefully collected his bon mots cicero has boasted of the great actions he has done for his country because there is no vanity in exulting in the performance of our duties but he has not boasted that he was the most eloquent orator of his age though he certainly was because nothing is more disgustful than to exult in our intellectual powers  i must confess myself no admirer of the witticisms of cicero for in general they are but meagre puns such as these  he said to a senator who was the son of a tailor  rem acu tetigisti to the son of a cook  ego quoque tibi jure favebo  socrates the following character of socrates is to be found in the matanasiana it deserves to be snatched from that oblivion in which it lies sunk  socrates whom the oracle of delphos had pronounced to be the wisest of men inculcated this maxim that science alone was wealth and ignorance evil born in the depth of obscurity his genius broke out like a superior luminary amongst his fellowcitizens he had as many disciples as he had auditors ever bold yet moderate chaste patient and amiable his continual application to study had rendered every virtue familiar to him yet he was so modest that he affirmed he knew nothing perfectly but one thing which was  that he was very ignorant such was his consummate prudence that he could predict future events it was this deep foresight into human affairs which occasioned the athenians to attribute a familiar demon to him who was careful to instruct him of the future he entertained so sublime an idea of friendship that according to him no inheritance was so precious as the possession of a friend in a word he was so enlightened and so resolute that he triumphed over his natural evil inclinations and vanquished every opposition to virtue by his science and his fortitude so deep a tranquillity had pervaded his soul that the necessity of swallowing poison by the edict of the tyrants never disturbed his repose the evening before it was to take place  prefaces a preface being the porch or the entrance to a book should be perfectly beautiful it is the elegance of a porch which announces the splendour of an edifice i have observed that ordinary readers skip over these little elaborate compositions our fair ladies consider them as so many pages lost which might better be employed in the addition of a picturesque scene or a tender letter to their novels for my part i always gather amusement from a preface be it aukwardly or skilfully written for dullness or impertinence may raise a laugh for a page or two though they become insufferable throughout a whole volume  the ancients and moderns frequent and violent disputes have arisen on the subject of the preference which is to be given to the ancients or the moderns with the battle of books by swift the reader is well acquainted the controversy of perrault and boileau makes a considerable figure in french literature yet surely it had been better if these acrid controversies had never disgraced the republic of letters the advice of sidonius appollinaris is excellent he says that we should read the ancients with respect and the moderns without envy  mutual persecution the pagans were accustomed to accuse the christians of being the cause of the evils which affected the roman empire as origin remarks in his c xxiv on st matthew st cyprian in the commencement of his book ad demetrianum tertullian in his  0 c of his apology and arnobius in his first book when in it is turn christianity became the prevailing religion the christians accused the jews and the pagans of drawing on the empire the calamities

with an elevation of sentiment observes that one of the greatest advantages which princes possess above other men is that of being attended by servants as great as themselves  buchanan has this charming thought in one of his elegies to express the cruelty of his mistress it has the singular merit of being a trite subject treated in an uncommon manner she does nothing but practice cruelties when i am in her presence yet what tortures does she not feel when i am absent but it is not the regret of my absence nor the love she bears for me which occasions her thus to suffer no it is because she has not the pleasure of beholding me suffering  seneca amongst many tortured sentiments and trivial points has frequently a happy thought this on anger is eminently so  i wish he says that the ferocity of this passion could be spent at it is first appearance so that it might injure but once as in the case of the bees whose sting is destroyed for ever at the first puncture it occasions  nor do these thoughts yield in felicity or fancy  aristenetus says of a beauty that she seemed most beautiful when dressed yet appeared not less beautiful when undressed of two beauties he says they yielded to the graces only in number  menage has these two terse and pointed lines on the portrait of a lady  ce portrait ressemble a la belle il est insensible comme elle which a friend has thus imitated  in this portrait my fair thy resemblance i see an insensible charmer it is  just like thee   a french poet has admirably expressed the instantaneous sympathy of two lovers a princess is relating to her confidante the birth of her passion and says  et comme un jeune coeur est bientot enflamme il me vit il maima je le vis je laimai which may be thus imitated in english but the alexandrine seems here to have the advantage over the heroic verse  soon is the youthful heart by passion moved he saw and loved me  him i saw and loved   i recollect a similar passage in a spanish play of calderon but it partakes i think too much of what boileau calls  le clinquant de tasse for it is well observed by the same critic that nothing is beautiful which is false the passage i allude to runs thus   i saw and i loved her so nearly together that i do not know if i saw her before i loved her or loved her before i saw her  it was said of petronius that he was pura impuritas pura because of his style impuritas because of his obscenities  quam multa quam paucis is a fine expression which was employed to characterise a concise style pregnant with meaning  how exquisitely tender does tasso in one verse describe his olindo so much love and so much modesty however beautiful they may appear in poetry the less romantic taste of the modern fine lady may not probably admire  brama assai poco spera nulla chiede he desires much he hopes little he asks nothing   perrault has very poetically informed us that the ancients were ignorant of the circulation of the blood   ignoroit

has survived his mistress thus sweetly express himself  piango la sua morte ela mia vita much i deplore her death and much my life   it has been usual for poets to say that rivers flow to convey their tributary streams to the sea this figure being a mark of subjection proved offensive to a patriotic italian and he has ingeniously said of the river po because of it is rapidity  pare che porti guerra e non tributo al mare which may be thus imitated  see rapid po to oceans empire bring a war and not a tribute from his spring   i would distinguish these pastoral verses for their elegant simplicity

skilled shepherd graceful frame a crown more precious can compose than the bright diamonds costlier flame   perhaps this translation produced extempore by a literary friend in which the original

preferred by a correct english ear  with flowers the enameled meads unfold by skilful hands in chaplets bound as nobly may desert be crowned as with rich gems and burnished gold   early printing when first the art of printing was discovered they only made use of one side of a page they had not yet found out the expedient of impressing the other when their editions were intended to be curious they omitted to print the first letter of a chapter for which they left a blank space that it might be painted or illuminated at the option of the purchaser several ancient volumes of these early times have been found where these letters are wanting as they neglected to have them painted  when the art of printing was first established it was the glory of the learned to be correctors of the press to the eminent printers physicians lawyers and bishops themselves occupied this department the printers then added frequently to their names those of the correctors of the press and editions were then valued according to the abilities of the corrector  patrons authors have too frequently received illtreatment even from those to whom they dedicated their works  theodosius gaza had no other recompense for having inscribed to sixtus the fourth his translation of the book of aristotle on the nature of animals than the price of the binding which this charitable father of the church munificently bestowed upon him  theocritus fills his idyllimus with loud complaints of the neglect of his patrons and tasso was as little successful in his dedications  ariosto in presenting his orlando furioso to the cardinal deste was gratified with the bitter sarcasm of  where the devil have you found all this nonsense  when the french historian dupleix whose pen was indeed fertile presented his book to the duke depernon this mecenas turning to the popes nuncio who was present very coarsely exclaimed  cadedis ce monsieur a un flux enrage il chie un livre tous les lunes  it was

mortification to find by the discovery of a friend that he had kept it in his possession three weeks before he could collect sufficient intellectual desire to cut open the first pages   every man believes writes dr johnson in a letter to baretti that mistresses are unfaithful and patrons are capricious but he excepts his own mistress and his own patron  the imprisonment of the learned imprisonment seems not much to have disturbed the man of letters in the progress of his studies  it was in prison that boethius composed his excellent book on the consolations of philosophy  grotius wrote in his confinement his commentary on saint matthew  buchanan in the dungeon of a monastery in portugal composed his excellent paraphrases of the psalms of david  pelisson during five years confinement for some state affairs pursued with ardour his studies in the greek language in philosophy and particularly in theology and produced several good compositions  michael cervantes composed

applying himself to his studies which he had hitherto neglected he became in consequence an able and enlightened monarch  margaret queen of henry the fourth king of france confined in the louvre pursued very warmly the studies of elegant literature and composed a very skilful apology for the irregularities of her conduct  charles the first during his cruel confinement at holmsby wrote that excellent book entitled the portrait of a king which he addressed to his son and where the political reflections will be found not unworthy of tacitus this work has however been attributed by his enemies to a dr gawden who was incapable of writing a single paragraph of it  queen elizabeth while confined by her sister mary wrote some very charming poems which we do not find she ever could equal after her enlargement and mary queen of scots during her long imprisonment by elizabeth produced many pleasing poetic compositions  sir walter ralegh  according to his own orthography  produced in his confinement his history of the world of whom it is observed to employ the language of hume they had leisure to reflect on the hardship not to say the injustice of his sentence they pitied his active and enterprizing spirit which languished in the rigours of confinement they were struck with the extensive genius of the man who being educated amidst naval and military enterprises had surpassed in the pursuits of literature even those of the most recluse and sedentary lives and they admired his unbroken magnanimity which at his age and under his circumstances could engage him to undertake and execute so great a work as his history of the world  the poverty of the learned fortune has rarely condescended to be the companion of merit even in these enlightened times men of letters have lived in obscurity while their reputation was widely spread and have perished in poverty while their works were enriching the booksellers  homer poor and blind resorted to the public places to recite his verses for a morsel of bread  the facetious poet plautus gained a livelihood by assisting a miller  xylander sold his notes on dion cassius for a dinner  alde manutius was so wretchedly poor that the expense of removing his library from venice to rome made him insolvent  to mention those who left nothing behind them to satisfy the undertaker were an endless task  agrippa died in a workhouse cervantes is supposed to have died with hunger camoens was deprived of the necessaries of life and is believed to have perished in the streets  the great tasso was reduced to such a dilemma that he was obliged to borrow a crown from a friend to subsist through the week he alludes to his distress in a pretty sonnet which he addresses to his cat entreating her to assist him during the night with

french poet was constrained to labor with rapidity and to live in the cottage of an obscure village his bookseller bought his heroic verses for one hundred sols the hundred lines and the smaller ones

spent his life in travels and study to form his relation of the world when he gave it to the public for the reward of his labors was thrown into prison at the suit of his printer yet this was the book

own account and otway a dramatic poet in the first class is known to have perished with hunger  samuel boyce whose poem on creation ranks high in the scale of poetic excellence was absolutely famished

chief materials found a penny tart a luxury and a luxury it was to him who could not always get bread to his water  in a book entitled de infortunio litteratorum may be found many other examples of the miseries of literary men  the destruction of books it is remarkable that conquerors in the moment of victory or in the unsparing devastation of their rage have not been satisfied with destroying men but have even carried their vengeance to books  the romans burnt the books of the jews of the christians and the philosophers the jews burnt the books of the christians and the pagans and the christians burnt the books of the pagans and the jews  the greater part of the books of origin and the other heretics were continually burnt by the orthodox party  cardinal ximenes at the taking of grenada condemned to the flames five thousand alcorans  the puritans burnt every thing they found which bore the vestige of popish origin we have on record many curious accounts of their holy depredations of their maiming images and erasing pictures cromwell zealously set fire to the library at oxford which was the most curious in europe  the most violent persecution which ever the republic of letters has undergone is that of the caliph omar after having it proclaimed throughout the kingdom that the alcoran contained every thing which was useful to believe and to know he caused to be gathered together whatever books could be found in his wide realms and distributed them to the owners of the baths to be used in heating their stoves and it is said that they employed no other materials for this purpose during a period of six months  at the death of the learned peiresc a chamber in his house filled with letters from the most eminent scholars of the age was discovered such was the disposition of his niece who inherited his estates that although repeatedly entreated to permit them to be published she preferred employing them to other purposes and it was her singular pleasure to regale herself occasionally with burning these learned epistles to save the expense of fireing  even the civilization of the eighteenth century could not preserve from the savage and destructive fury of a disorderly mob in the most polished city of europe the valuable papers of the earl of mansfield which were madly consigned to the flames during the disgraceful riots of june    0  descartes and harvey vigneul marville in his melanges de literature vol ii page     has ventured to publish two anecdotes which most probably are derived only from his own inventive talent a talent which no man carried to greater perfection than this lively and bold writer   one claudian mamert who flourished in the fifth century has composed a treatise on the soul in which are found the greater part of those principles which descartes made use of to establish his new system it is also said that his opinion concerning the souls of brutes is to be found in st augustine   it is said that the religious of st vannes have discovered in st ambrose the doctrine of the circulation of the blood which has been thought to be a modern discovery by harvey  i am fearful this anecdote was dictated in the uncharitable spirit of criticism perhaps to deprive our great physician of the honor of it is discovery  legends the origin of so many fables and intolerable absurdities which have been entitled legends arises from this circumstance   before any colleges were established in the monasteries where the schools were held the professors in rhetoric frequently gave their scholars the life of some saint for a trial of their talent at amplification the students being constantly at a loss to furnish out their pages invented these wonderful adventures the good fathers of that age whose simplicity was not inferior to their devotion were so delighted with these flowers of rhetoric that they were induced to make a collection of these miraculous compositions not imagining that at some distant period of time they would become matters of faith yet when james de voraigne vicar general of the jacobins peter nadal and peter ribadeneira wrote the lives of the saints they sought for their materials in the libraries of the monasteries and awakening from the dust these manuscripts of amplification imagined they made an invaluable present to the world by laying before them these bulky absurdities the people received them with all imaginable simplicity and in the last century it was dangerous for a man to dare even to suspect the reality of these pious fictions we are indebted to tillemont to fleury baillet launoi and bollandus for having cleared much of this rubbish and rejecting what was false by an enlightened criticism have made that probable which before was doubtful   what has been called the golden legend which is the compilation of the above voraigne observes patin is a book replete with the most ridiculous and silly histories imaginable melchior canus who was a learned dominican greatly disapproves of this legend and had said that it is a narrative at once unworthy of the saints and every honest christian i do not know why it should be called golden composed as it is by a man who had a mouth of iron and a heart of lead  it will probably be agreeable to the reader to inspect a specimen of these legends to gratify his curiosity i have selected the following and that he may not complain of the tedious length of this article it shall not be given to him in the heavy style of james de voraigne or of myself but embellished by the luminous diction of mr gibbon    among the insipid legends of ecclesiastical history i am tempted to distinguish the memorable fable of the seven sleepers whose imaginary date corresponds with the reign of the younger theodosius and the conquest of africa by the vandals when the emperor decius persecuted the christians seven noble youths of ephesus concealed themselves in a spacious cavern on the side of an adjacent mountain where they were doomed to perish by the tyrant who gave orders that the entrance should be firmly secured with a pile of stones they immediately fell into a deep slumber which was miraculously prolonged without injuring the powers of life during a period of one hundred and eightyseven years at the end of that time the slaves of adolius to whom the inheritance of the mountain had descended removed the stones to supply materials for some rustic edifice the light of the sun darted into the cavern and the seven sleepers were permitted to awake after a slumber as they thought of a few hours they were pressed by the calls of hunger and resolved that jamblichus one of their number should secretly return to the city to purchase bread for the use of his companions the youth  if we may still employ that appellation  could no longer recognize the once familiar aspect of his native country and his surprise was increased by the appearance of a large cross triumphantly erected over the principal gate of ephesus his singular dress and obsolete language confounded the baker to whom he offered an ancient medal of decius as the current coin of the empire and jamblichus on the suspicion of a secret treasure was dragged before the judge their mutual enquiries produced the amazing discovery that two centuries were almost elapsed since jamblichus and his friends had escaped from the rage of a pagan tyrant the bishop of ephesus the clergy the magistrates the people and it is said the emperor theodosius himself hastened to visit the cavern of the seven sleepers who bestowed their benediction related their story and at the same instant peaceably expired   this popular tale mr gibbon adds mahomet learned when he drove his camels to the fairs of syria and he has introduced it as a divine revelation into the koran  the same story has been adopted and adorned by the nations from bengal to africa who profess the mohammedan religion  on the fairsex having no souls a spanish author has affirmed that brutes have no souls a french writer supports the same opinion but an italian more bold has ventured to maintain that the fairsex have likewise no souls and are of another species of animal to man this the author shows by various proofs drawn from the scriptures which he explains according to his own fancy while this book was published in latin the inquisition remained silent but when it was translated into the vulgar tongue they censured and prohibited it the italian ladies were divided on this occasion into two opposite parties the one was greatly enraged to be made so inferior to the other sex and the other considering themselves only as machines were content to amuse themselves in playing off the springs in the manner most agreeable to themselves  the author of the commentary on the epistles of st paul falsely ascribed to st ambrose says on the eleventh chapter of the first epistle to the corinthians that women are not made according to the image of the creator  the mahometans are known to hold the same opinions concerning the souls of the female sex and likewise the jews very ungallantly each jew among his morning benedictions includes one to thank god he has not made him a woman  i must confess it is a difficult task to resolve if  this novelty on earth this fair defect of nature  milton are deprived of souls for it is in vain to think to guess at women by appearances that paint and patch their imperfections of intellectual complexions and daub their tempers over with washes as artificial as their faces hudibras  let us however conclude that if they are not themselves in possession of a soul they not infrequently seem to infuse one into the most unanimated of men it is their white hand that distributes with peculiar grace the laurels of the poet and the hero through all classes of mankind their power is alike displayed the smiles of his nancy animate the sailor and the soldier as well as

celebrity as his works have made him loitering in an idle hour in the shop of a bookseller in turning over a parcel of books lhomme de descartes fell into his hands having dipped into some parts he

to jump with him and in the true spirit of a courtier having made some efforts which nearly reached the cardinals confessed he was surpassed by him this was jumping like a politician and it was by this means it is said he ingratiated himself with the minister  dr campbell was alike fond of robust exercise and the scholar has been found leaping over tables and chairs  what ridiculous amusements passed between dean swift and his friends in ireland his discerning editors have kindly revealed to the public we are astonished to see a great mind suffering itself to be levelled to trifles which even our very magazines consider as disgraceful to their pages  the life of shenstone was passed in an amusement which was to him an eternal source of disappointment and anguish his favorite ferme ornee while it displayed all the taste and elegancies of the poet displayed also his characteristic poverty his feeling mind was often pained by those invidious comparisons which the vulgar were perpetually making with the stately scenes of hagleys neighboring magnificence  if dr johnson suffered his great mind to descend into trivial amusement it was  to borrow the image of a friend  like the elephant who sometimes gives a shock to armies and sometimes permits himself to be led by a naked infant  the belles lettres it seems to be the fate of the belles lettres an ingenious french writer observes that they break out in all their splendor during some ages and then are again doomed to decline into total neglect  athens long preserved a correct taste in eloquence in philosophy and in poetry at the same time the fine arts flourished in all their beauty but a frightful barbarism soon succeeded the refinement and the science of this ingenious nation  the romans having vanquished the greeks awakened the muses from their lethargy and the augustan age was for italy what that of pisistratus had been for greece the decline of that empire soon occasioned that of the belles lettres and the invasions of those people who dismembered the roman empire threw all again into barbarism and ignorance charlemagne attempted to revive the sciences he rewarded the learned and he established schools in the principal cities of the empire it was his command that a number of volumes should be transcribed to be dispersed throughout the kingdom  our illustrious alfred began the same reformation in england engaged as he was in one continued war with the danes nothing could disturb the designs he had formed for the restoration of letters he laments the ignorance of the times with all the indignation of the philosopher and the resentment of a patriot prince  the attempts of these great monarchs availed little the clash of arms taught a melancholy silence to the muses since those times as the monarchical government became more firmly established the belles lettres insensibly revived  but it was chiefly under the pontificate of leo the tenth that munificent patron of literature that they sprung up in all their richest luxuriance assisted by the art of printing which had been discovered some time before they made those immense progresses and formed those heroes of literature which so forcibly claim our warmest admiration  on teaching the classics those says marville who undertake the instruction of youth and who read the ancients with their scholars should point out to their observation the characteristic trait of each of these authors this manner of teaching might inspire them to emulate these perfect models of composition  xenophon for instance and quintilian are excellent to form the education of young scholars  plato will fill the mind with great notions and elevate them into a contemplation of the sublimest metaphysics  aristotle will instruct them acutely to analyze the principle of composition and to decide on the beauties of the works of imagination  cicero will show them how to speak and to write with grace seneca to philosophise  the elder pliny opens the mind to a great diversity of knowledge aesop and phaedrus in an amusive way will form their manners  epictetus and the emperor antoninus will afford them advice and counsels in every station of human life  plutarch offers the noblest examples of antiquity and furnishes excellent matter for attic conversations  homer displays man in every possible situation and paints him always great  virgil inculcates piety toward the gods and filial tenderness toward our parents  in sallust the portraits of the great may be contemplated in plautus and terence those of individuals in horace and the younger pliny the delicate eulogiums which may be administered to kings  but before these great models are offered to the study of our youth as they claim a maturity of judgment let them first be initiated by some elementary works  errata besides the ordinary errors or errata which happen in printing a work there are others which are purposely committed that the errata may contain what is not permitted to appear in the body of the work  thus for instance wherever the inquisition has any power particularly at rome observes menage it is not allowed to employ the word fatum or fata in any book  an author desirous of using the latter word adroitly invented this scheme he had printed in his book facta and in the errata he put for facta read fata  a gentleman did nearly the same thing but on another occasion he had composed some verses at the head of which he had placed this dedication  a guillemette chienne de ma soeur but having a quarrel with his sister he maliciously put into the errata instead of chienne de ma soeur read ma chienne de soeur  in a book there was printed le docte morel a wag put into the errata for le docte morel read le docteur morel this morel was certainly not the first docteur who was not docte  samuel purchase samuel purchase of whom mention has been made in a former article has composed what he calls  a relation of the world and the religions observed in all ages and places discovered from the creation unto this present the title page is very curious and very long but through a mutilation in my copy i cannot gratify the reader with the whole the work is written according to the taste of our royal pedant the graces of diction consist in a play upon words  jests for dutchmen and english boys cowley  the author on the most serious subjects indulges his facetious humor he finds amplification in metaphysical quibbles and irresistible arguments in puns it will be necessary to give some instances and it may not be unpleasing to extract a few sentences which must have greatly delighted our first james    being i know not by what natural inclination addicted to the study of history i resolved to turn the pleasures of my studies into studious pains that others might again by delightful study turn my pains into their pleasures  i here bring religion from paradise to the ark and thence follow her round the world  the following apology of the author is curious and ingenious it should be recollected that one part of it is merit consists in it is being prefixed to a treatise on geography    if any mislike the fullness in some places and the barrenness of words in others let them consider we handle a world where are mountains and valleys fertile habitations and sandy deserts and others steps whom i follow hold me sometimes in a narrower way which elsewhere take more liberty  in addressing the clergy purchase thus plays off an argument in a pun which may raise a smile    i subscribe with hand and practice to your liturgy but not to your letargie  the fourth edition of this system of geography  a stupendous labor for those times and which with hackluyts voyages gave birth to the numerous ones we now possess  is dedicated to king charles the first from this dedication the present extracts may amuse    your majestys goodness has invited this boldness in accepting my late voluminous twins of pilgrims  he means his former two volumes your piety demands hereditarie respect your royal father the king of learned and learnings king manifested so much favor to this work as to make it ordinary of his bedchamber he professed freely that he had read it seven times and that he had made the pilgrims his nightly task till god called him by fatal sickness to a better pilgrimage and of a more enduring kingdom such a testimony is a king of testimonies although these times seem more to savor of arms than to favor arts  inter arma silent musae yet our muse is not of the softer sock but more masculine an armed pallas not bred in poetical mystery but born a real history containing actions factions and fractions of religions and states  he concludes with this curious wish  may king james be succeeded and exceeded in the greatness and virtues of great briteins great charles amen  such was the incense which administered to adulated majesty was probably found not unpleasing  on the notes variorum the notes variorum were originally but a compilation of notes drawn from those numerous critics who had labored on the best authors or had explained them in other works the first collections were very indifferent their selectors possessing no powers of discrimination frequently they have chosen the worst they bring no proofs from the authors whom they have abridged and they are continually maiming their ideas to make their collections bulky they have written as much on the clear as on the obscure passages and have swelled them with very frivolous digressions  the later editions of the notes variorum have been made by more able compilers as they are so much the more preferable to the preceding ones the public has received them with favor and scholars have been glad to have complete collections of the most valued criticisms to consult them at their need  on the editions of the classics in usum delphini the scholiasts or the interpreters of the dauphin in usum serenissimi delphini were undertaken under the conduct of messieurs de montausier bossuet and huet to a correct text they have added a clear and concise paraphrase of the text with notes the dissimilarity of the genius and the peculiar characters of all these authors have been one great cause that they have not all been treated with the same ability and with equal felicity but still it must be allowed they form the most beautiful body in literature that the public has ever been gratified with  another critic presents us with a more satisfactory account of this celebrated edition of the classics the greater part of these interpreters have but indifferently executed their employment they have followed in their text the inferior editions instead of making use of the best and they have left in the notes those same faults which were so much censured in the dutch editions with the notes variorum there is however one thing valuable in the paris editions  a verbal index by which any passage may be found on recollecting a few words however it must be confessed the munificent patronage of a great monarch has not produced the adequate effects the project was excellent but the performance was bad  i cannot conclude this article without observing what benefits the student derives from verbal indexes he not only saves a great expense of time which is squandered in the examination for passages but he may more easily trace the imitations of others when they happen to catch the words of the original i have received such services from newtons edition of milton which is enriched with a verbal index that i cannot recollect them without gratitude if a verbal index was formed to johnsons edition of the poets it would then become invaluable and i am sure there are porters enough in literature unemployed who desire nothing better than to bear this burden on their shoulders  the origin of literary journals if we abound with a multitude of scribblers what an infinite number must there be of critics since according to the computation of one of the first  ten censure wrong for one who writes amiss  in the last century it was a consolation at least for the unsuccessful writer that he fell insensibly into oblivion if he committed the private folly of printing what no one would purchase he had only to settle the matter with his publisher he was not arraigned at the public tribunal as if he had committed a crime of magnitude but in those times the nation was little addicted to the cultivation of letters the writers were then few and the readers were not many when at length a taste for literature spread itself through the body of the people vanity induced the inexperienced and the ignorant to aspire to literary honors to oppose these inroads into the haunts of the muses periodical criticism brandished it is formidable weapon and it was by the fall of others that our greatest geniuses have been taught to rise multifarious writings produced multifarious strictures and if the rays of criticism were not always of the strongest kind yet so many continually issuing formed a focus which has enlightened those whose occupations had otherwise never permitted them to judge on literary compositions  the origin of so many literary journals takes it is birth in france denis de sallo ecclesiastical counselor in the parliament of paris invented the scheme of a work of this kind on the  0th of may      appeared the first number of his journal des scavans what is remarkable he published his essay in the name of the sieur de hedouville who was his footman one is led to suppose by this circumstance that he entertained but a faint hope of it is success or perhaps he thought that the scurrility of criticism might be sanctioned by it is supposed author the work however met with so favorable a reception that sallo had the satisfaction of seeing it in the next year imitated throughout europe and his journal at the same time translated into various languages but as most authors lay themselves too open to the severe critic the animadversions of sallo were given with such malignity of wit and asperity of criticism that the journal excited loud murmurs and the most heartmoving complaints possible sallo after having published only his third journal felt the irritated wasps of literature thronging so thick about him that he very gladly abdicated the throne of criticism  the reign of his successor abbe galloys  intimidated by the fate of sallo  was of a milder kind he contented himself with only giving the titles of books accompanied with extracts such a conduct was not offensive to their authors and yet was not unuseful to the public i do not however mean to favor the idea that this simple manner of noticing books is equal to sound and candid criticism  on the model of the journal des scavans were formed our philosophical transactions with this difference however that they only notice objects of science such as physics and mathematics the journal of leipsic entitled acta eruditorum appeared in      under the conduct of the erudite menkenius professor in the university of that city the famous bail undertook for holland a similar work in      and his nouvelles de la republique de lettres appeared the first of may in that year this new journal was every where well received and deserved to be so for never were criticisms given with greater force he possessed the art of comprizing in short extracts the justest notion of a book without adding any thing irrelevant or impertinent bail discontinued this work in      after having given thirtysix volumes in   mo others continued it to    0 when it was finally closed  a mr de la roche formed an english journal entitled memoirs of literature about the commencement of this century which is well spoken of in the bibliotheque raisonnee it was afterward continued by mr reid under the title of the present state of the republic of letters he succeeded very well but being obliged to make a voyage to china it interrupted his useful labors he was succeeded by messieurs campbell and webster but the last for reasons of which i am ignorant being dismissed it was again resumed by mr campbell this journal does by no means rival our modern reviews i do not perceive that the criticism is more valuable and certainly the entertainment is inferior our elder journals seem only to notice a few of the best publications and this not with great animation of sentiment or elegance of diction  of our modern journals it becomes me to speak with caution it is not treading on ashes still glowing with latent fire as horace expresses it but it is rushing through consuming flames let it be sufficient that from their pages i acknowledge to have acquired a rich fund of critical observation and if i have been animated by their eulogiums i ascribe this honor not so much to the confined abilities nature has bestowed on me as to their strictures which have taught me something of the delicacy of taste and something of the ardour of genius  guy patin guy patin was an author who made much noise in his time but like many others of this kind posterity more temperate as less interested in the scandal of the day will not allow pertness to be wit and multifarious anecdote learning we as englishmen must peculiarly feel our indignation kindle at the strictures which i shall notice and which garbage as they are have been hashed up by dargens voltaire and many a french literary cuisinier  the work for which he gained so much unmerited applause consists of three volumes of letters which were written to his friends in a familiar style replete with the anecdotes of the day  a kind of newspaper rather than an epistolary correspondence and like a newspaper since time has commented on it is text it will be found that the greater part of these anecdotes is false and malicious they were read however with great avidity but this criticism of menage will be found to be just    the letters of guy patin are replete with falsehoods mr bigot and i have detected some in every page he was not careful in what he wrote and he took every thing as it came   these letters says voltaire were read eagerly because they contained anecdotes of such things as every body likes and satires which are liked still more they show what uncertain guides in history those writers are who inconsiderately set down the news of the day such accounts are frequently false or perverted by the malice of mankind  bail in criticizing them observes  it is proper the reader should know all the witty sayings and stories he relates are not true there are some places wherein he shows a terrible malice and a prodigious boldness in giving a criminal turn to every thing  this language is indeed forcible it is certainly just the reader may judge by the extract i now make out of the patiniana page    it was written when salmasius finished his defense of king charles which was so nervously answered by milton   the book of mr salmasius written for the defense of the king of england is now printing at leyden in french and in latin this apology for a king who has been beheaded by his people is a delicate subject and will not please every body the english who are the worst the most cruel and the most perfidious of people pretend that they are countenanced by their religion and the political law but religio non fert parricidas ecclesia nescit sanguinem the most refined politics do not go so far as to dare to punish kings like other malefactors by the hand of the common hangman the grandfather of this monarch was strangled by the puritans of scotland his grandmother mary stuart was beheaded in england in the year      by the command of queen elizabeth i who naturally hate the english cannot but shudder with horror when i think of this nation  i shall say nothing on this extraordinary passage but only remark that though all this passed so near the times in which patin lived he has committed in this short extract a gross historical blunder  it has been a custom to echo amongst the gallic writers that the english nation are of the race  of the cannibals that each other eat the anthropophagi    the very executions of our malefactors at tyburn have been urged as a proof hear voltaire    there have been sanguinary times in all nations but amongst the english more illustrious men have been brought to the block than in all europe besides it was the character of this nation to commit legal murders the gates of london have been infected with human heads fixed to the walls  dargens in his philosophical visions has given the character of the english nations under the names of the libertines in the second vision the passage is too long to be quoted but the power of his pencil seems not inferior to that of the lively voltaires in drawing our portrait with a vermilion hue monsters as shakespeare says  whose heads do grow beneath their shoulders    he says that a civil war is our delight and the beheading a monarch our amusement this hardly deserves the name of wit it is certainly destitute of truth i have not infrequently thought that these lively and facetious writers for surely they did not mean to be serious are ignorant of their own history no improbable circumstance with those who probably have written nearly as many books as they have read i maintain that france has known more sanguinary periods than england and that more of their kings than of our own have come to an untimely end let us recollect the assassinations of henry the third and fourth the reigns of henry the second and charles the fourth louis the thirteenth and fourteenth and let all the efforts of all the patins produce a massacre in england so dreadful as that of st bartholomew in france  the talmud and gemara the talmud is a collection of jewish traditions which had been orally preserved it comprizes the mishna which is the text and the gemara it is commentary it is a complete system of the barbarous learning of the jews they have persuaded themselves that these traditional explications are of a divine origin for they tell us that the pentateuch was written out by their legislator before his death that the number of copies was thirteen one for each tribe and the remaining one was deposited in the ark that the oral law was what moses continually taught in his sanhedrim to the elders and the rest of the people the mode of which honest david levi informs us was thus    as soon as moses was returned to his tent from receiving the words of god he called aaron thither unto him and first delivered unto him the text which was to be the written law and after that the interpretation of it which was the oral law in the same order as he received both from god in the mount then aaron arising and seating himself at the right hand of moses eleazar and ithamar his sons went in the next and being taught both these laws at the feet of the prophet in the same manner as aaron had been they also arose and seated themselves and then the seventy elders who constituted the sanhedrim or great senate of the nation and then entered all such of the people as were desirous of knowing the word of god  he then informs us that moses aaron his sons and the elders made the same repetition before they withdrew  so that the people having heard both these laws repeated to them four times they all had it thereby firmly fixed in their memories but the interpretation thereof was to be delivered down only by word of mouth to the succeeding generations for which no reason is alleged  it appears afterward that at the end of the  0th year of their flight from egypt the memory of the people became treacherous and moses was constrained to repeat every now and then this same oral law which if it is not profane to say had been much better written as the pentateuch was  this history some may be inclined to suppose to be apocryphal it appears that the talmud was compiled by certain jewish doctors who were solicited for this purpose by their nation that they might have something to oppose to their christian adversaries these doctors were descendants of the ten tribes of israel who were led into captivity by king salmanazar father of sennacherib in the reign of king hosea this book is a mixture of the syriac the hebrew and the vulgar hebrew which was the language spoken in the schools of the rabbis and which differs as much from the other as the latin of bartolinus from that of cicero this work contains nothing that is valuable but a very heavy load of pious absurdities of insipid stories and palpable contradictions the only apology that has been made for these extravagancies and idle fictions is that after the completion of the talmud those who succeeded in the schools are distinguished by the name of opinionists and not by that of doctors and that no jew is compelled to receive them as matters of faith although we are informed that this work originated as we have already observed from the great dictator of the written law  as the reader may be curious to know one of these rabbinical reveries we have compiled some notices which they have given concerning adam  adams body was made of the earth of babylon his head of the land of israel his other members of other parts of the world r meir thought he was compact of the earth gathered out of the whole earth as it is written  thine eyes did see my substance now it is elsewhere written  the eyes of the lord are over all the earth r aha expressly marks the twelve hours in which his various parts were formed his stature was from one end of the world to the other and it was for his transgression that the creator laying his hand in anger on him lessened him for before says r eleazar with his hand he reached the firmament r jehuda thinks his sin was heresy but r isaac thinks as my author expresses it that it was nourishing his foreskin  they farther inform us that he was an hermaphrodite having both sexes and a double body the female parts joined at the shoulders and back parts to the male their countenances turned from each other and this they prove by moses saying  so god created man in his image male and female created he them and he called their name adam adam being solitary cut himself in two a hint this to the managers for their pantomimes and found himself fitted for procreation leo hebraeus thus reconciles the fable of platos audrogynus with the narration of moses from which he thinks it is borrowed plato relates that jupiter in the first forming of mankind made them such audrogini with two bodies of two sexes joined in the breast which he divided for their pride the navel still remaining as a scar of the wound then made  this article may be sufficient to satiate the reader with a perusal of the talmud for his farther satisfaction i refer him to basnages histoire des juifs tome iv p       cardinal richelieu the present anecdote concerning cardinal richelieu may serve to teach the man of letters how he deals out criticism to the great when they ask his opinion of manuscripts be they in verse or prose  the cardinal placed in a gallery of his palace the portraits of several illustrious men among them was blaise de montluc marshall of france he was desirous of composing the inscriptions which were to be placed round the portraits that which he intended for montluc was conceived in these terms multa fecit plura scripsit vir tamen magnus fuit he showed it to bourbon the royal professor in greek and asked his opinion concerning it having read it he expressed his dislike in warm terms and thought it was latin much in the style of the breviary and if it had concluded with an allelujah it would serve for an anthem to the magnificat the cardinal agreed with the severity of his strictures and even acknowledged the discernment of the professor for he said it is really written by a priest but however he might approve of bourbons critical power he punished without mercy his ingenuity the pension his majesty had bestowed on him was withheld the next year  the cardinal was one of those ambitious men who foolishly aspire to excel in whatever a true genius is most excellent and because he saw himsef constantly disappointed he envied with all the venom of rancour those talents which are so frequently all that men of genius possess  here are two interesting anecdotes  he was jealous of balzac because his reputation became so splendid he even offered the elder heinsius ten thousand crowns to write a criticism which should ridicule his elaborate compositions this heinsius refused because salmasius threatened to revenge balzac on his herodes infanticida  he attempted to rival the reputation of corneilles cid by opposing to it one of the most ridiculous productions that was ever exhibited in the theater it was an allegorical tragedy in which the minister had congregated the four quarters of the world it was distinguished by the name of europe and a great deal of political matter was thrown together and divided into scenes and acts when he first sent it anonymously to the french academy it was reprobated he then tore it in rage and scattered it about his study toward evening like another medea lamenting over the members of her own children he and his secretary passed the night in uniting the scattered limbs he then ventured to avow himself and having pretended to correct this incorrigible tragedy the submissive academy retracted their censures  but the public pronounced it is melancholy fate on it is first representation this was the tragedy which was intended to thwart corneilles cid enraged at it is success richelieu even commanded the academy to publish an abusive critique of it which is well known in french literature boileau on this occasion has these two wellturned verses  en vain contre le cid un ministre se ligue tout paris pour chimene a les yeux de rodrigue thus translated by a friend  to oppose the cid in vain a statesman tries all paris for chimene has rodrigues eyes   we must confess however that cardinal richelieu was a great politician whether his nouveau testament be his entire composition is uncertain he must however have supplied the materials as it contains much of what none but himself could know these anecdotes will serve to show to what a degree of selfopinion vanity may level a great man he who would attempt to display universal excellence will probably be disappointed it is certain he will be impelled to practice meannesses and to act follies which if he has the least sensibility must occasion him many a pang and many a blush  cardan the famous cardan was born at milan or at padua the place of his nativity being uncertain in the year   0  to great natural powers he added much acquired knowledge but above all he was ever desirous of information and to use the expression of a french writer he passed his life in continual meditation on him the italians have made this acute observation  that he has written more than he had read and taught more than he had learnt he died at rome in      where he attended pope gregory the thirteenth in the character of physician in his book de arcanis aeternitatis will be found a great number of curious discoveries scaliger who has written against him acknowledges that in many parts of his works his intelligence seems greater than that which any writer ever possessed while in other parts he betrays an imbecility of mind which would not be excuseable in a boy in matters of religion his opinions were unsettled he did not know where to choose all that has been said of god of paradise of purgatory of hell and of the immortality of the soul etc were things with him very disputable and we may add that they have appeared so likewise to others not less eminent than cardan  martin luther and calvin to oppose the church of rome in their idea of prayers addressed to the saints luther denied the immortality of the soul he said it expired with the body but that god revived both so that according to his opinion no one could enter into the visible presence of god till this operation had taken place the romish church holding a contrary opinion he treated as impious what it inculcates concerning the immortality of the soul these are dreadful shifts for men who pretend to act by an impulse of the divinity  calvin was originally named cauvin his stipend as minister at geneva was as miserable as the income of a welsh curate he was subject to eleven different maladies which continually afflicting him irritated his dispositions he had indeed so much acerbity in his temper that he became unsupportable to those who were near him it was this that occasioned many germans to say that they preferred being in hell with beza to being in paradise with calvin every day he taught theology preached and held various conferences yet in spite of all his occupations he contrived to leave behind him as an author nine ponderous folios he died at geneva in      aged fiftyfive he was a learned man but he has caused a world of woe he strove ambitiously to overturn every thing he was cruel and vindictive he occasioned the persecution of michael servetus who was so cruelly put to death in the name of a christian religion and by the hands of men who profess evangelical gentleness and all this for a difference about the trinity  it must however be recollected that these anecdotes and these sentiments are collected from catholic writers the first are probably exaggerated and the latter must be qualified by the discernment of the reader  tertullian tertullian a father of the primitive church was an african he is a most terrible author and does not yield easily to the hand of the translator he is all nerves his pen pierces like a graver his style would appear shocking to the present race of readers  with him discipline means the rights of religion faith it is theory and god and discipline mean god and his worship he calls the christians little fish because they are regenerated in the waters of baptism those who are baptized candidatos baptismi alluding to the white robes the baptized wore till the succeeding sunday which was therefore called the white sunday this is surely burlesquing the rites of baptism in this style are all his works composed and there have been many writers on sacred topics who greatly admire these flourishes of his pen we may approve of their religious zeal but not of their taste in composition balzac who pretends to be his admirer gives a very ingenious reason for it he says  it must be confessed that his style is obscure but that like the richest ebony through it is excess of darkness it is bright an idle conceit like this offers but a weak apology for the defects of a writer  lactantius censures him for his inelegance and harshness  malebranche says that his manner of writing dazzles the understanding and that like certain authors whose imaginations are vivid he persuades us without the aid of reason but he was a visionary and destitute of judgment his fire his raptures and his enthusiasm upon the most trivial subjects plainly indicate a disordered imagination what hyperboles what figures  salmasius the acutest commentator of the moderns when he undertook to examine his writings declared that certainly no one ever can understand him  yet this is one of the fathers who established christianity and i am pained to observe that a candid criticism on so bad a writer will be looked upon as committing an impiety toward christianity by certain zealots of religion who seem in their notions to be at least some centuries remote from the enlightened spirit of this age but let it be considered that i presume not to decide on matters of religious faith but only on those which concern the four and twenty letters of the alphabet  abelard although abelard an author so famous for his writings and his amors with eloisa or rather heloise is ranked not among the orthodox but the heretics because he ventured to publish opinions concerning the trinity which were in those times thought too subtle and too bold yet it is probably owing to his superior genius that he appeared so culpable in the eyes of his enemies the cabal formed against him disturbed the earlier part of his life with a thousand persecutions till at length they persuaded bernard his old friend but who had now turned saint that poor abelard was what their malice described him to be bernard enflamed against him condemned unheard the unfortunate scholar but it is remarkable that the book which was burnt as unorthodox and as the composition of abelard was in fact written by peter lombard bishop of paris a work which has since been canonized in the sorbonne and on which is founded the scholastic theology we may add also that because abelard in the warmth of honest indignation had reproved the monks of st denis in france and st gildas de ruys in bretagne for the horrid incontinence of their lives they joined his enemies and assisted to embitter the life of this ingenious scholar who perhaps was guilty of no other crime than that of feeling too sensibly an attachment to one who not only possessed the enchanting attractions of the softer sex but what indeed is very unusual a congeniality of disposition and an enthusiasm of imagination  is it in heaven a crime to love too well adam not the first man among the many singular opinions which some have endeavored to establish and in which indeed they have themselves firmly confided not the least to be distinguished is that of one isaac de la pereyre of bourdeaux he is the author of a book entitled  the preadamites where he attempts to show that adam is not the first of men he was always dreaming on this during his life and died in it is firm belief he would have been glad to have known that an ancient rabbin was so much inclined toward his system that he has even ventured to reveal the name of the preceptor of adam but this rabbin as menage observes was a rabbin and that is saying enough  when this book first made it is appearance it was condemned to be burnt by the hand of the common hangman menage has preserved a pretty bon mot of the prince de guemene which passed about the time this book made a noise one father adam a jesuit preached at st germain before the queen the sermon was execrable and being at the same time very personal was greatly disliked at court the queen spoke concerning it to the prince and asked him his opinion madam he replied i am a preadamite  what does that mean said the queen  it is madam the prince wittily answered that i do not think father adam to be the first of men  voltaire at ferney had also a pereadam on whom he frequently played off this witticism of the prince and those who are acquainted with his creed may believe that his observations on father adam were not a little pungent  these preadamites bring to my recollection two humorous lines of prior in his alma  and lest i should be wearied madam to cut things short come down to adam   the arabic chronicle the arabic chronicle of jerusalem is only valuable from the time of mahomet for such is the stupid superstition of the arabs that they pride themselves on being ignorant of whatever has passed before the mission of their prophet the most curious information it contains is concerning the croisades the abbe de longerue has translated several parts he who would be versed in the history of the croisades should attend to this chronicle it seems to have been written with impartiality it renders justice to the christian heroes and particularly dwells on the gallant actions of the count de saint gilles  what is worthyof observation is that our historians chiefly write concerning godfrey de bouillon only the learned know that the count de saint gilles acted there so important a character the stories of the saracens are just the reverse they speak little concerning godfrey and eminently distinguish saint gilles  tasso has given into the more vulgar accounts by making the former so eminent at the cost of the other heroes in his jerusalem delivered it was thus that virgil transformed by his magical power the chaste dido into a lover and homer the meretricious penelope into a moaning matron  priors hans carvel the story of the ring of hans carvel which fontaine has so prettily set off and prior has with such gaiety and freedom related is yet of very ancient standing but it has proved so much a favorite that a number of authors have employed it menage says that poggius florentine who died in      has the merit of it is invention  rabelais who has given it in his peculiar manner changed it is original name of philelphus to that of hans carvel  this tale will also be found in the eleventh of the one hundred new novels collected in       ariosto has borrowed it at the end of his fifth satire but by his pleasant manner of relating it we must confess it is fairly appropriated  an anonymous writer who published a collection of novels at lions in      has also employed it in his eleventh novel  cellio malespini has it again in page     of the second part of his two hundred novels printed at venice in   0   fontaine and an anonymous writer who has composed it in latin anacreontic verses have considered it to be a subject worthy of their pens and at length our prior has given it to us in his best manner so that i may vento predict that after ariosto la fontaine and prior he who again attempts it in the politer languages will partake the dishonorable fate of icarus  pliny pliny was by much too bold to advance in his natural history lib   cap    that the soul is not immortal this is a dreadful sentiment to be disseminated throughout a state for if this principle is established the good will no more hope for a recompense of their miseries nor the bad dread a punishment for their crimes  pliny was certainly a man of irreproachable character but the truth is that like most of the romans he aspired to glory by showing that he could be an honest man without the hope of any future reward the sentiment is noble but let it be confined to the narrow circle of speculative philosophy  pliny to express at the same time the invention and the malice of men says in writing on arrows that they have given wings to iron and taught it to fly like a bird  had he even added like a ravenous vulture perhaps it might have heightened this poetical image had he lived when gunpowder firearms and bombs were invented what metaphors could the philosopher have found to equal his indignation ariosto and milton have satirized this diabolical machinery when they gave them to be employed by the demons  the younger pliny has given a french wit observes so exact a description of his house that it looks as if he wished to dispose of it men of taste are fond of perpetuating those scenes which their lives have been passed in embellishing  the elder pliny who was so intimately acquainted with the human heart says on the subject of crystal vases that their fragility enhances their price and that it is the boast of luxury to make use of things that may at the slightest blow entirely perish  the younger pliny has this admirable sentiment  that he is a good man and of strict morals who pardons every one as if he himself committed faults every day and yet who endeavors to abstain from them as if he pardoned no one  mademoiselle de scudery bien heureux scudery dont la fertile plume peut enfanter tous les mois une petite volume it is boileau who has written the above couplet on the scuderies the brother and sister both famous in their day for composing romances which they sometimes extended to ten or twelve volumes it was the favorite literature of that period as much as the novels of the present times or to be more correct of the present hour our nobility not infrequently condescended to translate these voluminous compositions  the diminutive size of our modern novels is undoubtedly an improvement but in resembling the size of primers it were to be wished that their contents had also resembled their inoffensive page our greatgrandmothers were incommoded with overgrown folios and instead of finishing the eventful history of two lovers at one or two sittings it was sometimes six months including sundays before they could get quit of their clelias their cyruss and parthenissas  mademoiselle scudery menage informs us had composed ninety volumes the materials of which were entirely drawn from her own fertile invention she had even finished another romance but which she would not give to the public whose taste she saw no more relished these kinds of works   what a pleasing description he elsewhere observes has mademoiselle scudery made in her cyrus of the little court at rambouillet there are a thousand things in the romances of this learned lady that render them inestimable she has drawn from the ancients their happiest passages and has even improved upon them like the prince in the fable whatever she touches becomes gold we may read her works with great profit if we posses a correct taste and wish to gather instruction those who censure their length only show the littleness of their judgment as if homer and virgil were to be despised because many of their books are filled with episodes and incidents that necessarily retard the conclusion it does not require much penetration to observe that cyrus and clelia are species of the epic poem the epic must embrace a number of events to suspend the course of the narrative which only taking in a part of the life of the hero would terminate too soon to discover the skill of the poet without this artifice the charm of uniting the greater part of the episodes to the principal subject of the romance would be lost mademoiselle de scudery has so well treated them and so aptly introduced a variety of beautiful passages that nothing in this kind is comparable to her productions if we except some expressions and certain turns which have become somewhat obsolete all the rest will last for ever and outlive the criticisms they have undergone  menage has here certainly uttered a false prophecy her romances i only know by their names but this critique must be allowed to be given rather in the spirit of friendship than of true criticism  i shall add to this article the sentiments of a modern french writer who has displayed great ingenuity in his strictures   the misfortune of her having written too abundantly has occasioned an unjust contempt we confess there are many heavy and tedious passages in her voluminous romances but if we consider that in the clelia and the artamene are to be found inimitable delicate touches and many splendid parts which would do honor to some of our living writers we must acknowledge that the great defects of all her works arise from her not writing in an age when taste had reached the acme of cultivation which it now has such is her erudition that the french place her next to the celebrated madame dacier her works containing many secret intrigues of the court and city her readers relished on their early publication more keenly than we can at present  the scaligers the man of letters must confess  reluctantly perhaps  that the literature which stores the head with so many ingenious reflections and so much admirable intelligence may at the same time have little or no influence over the virtues of the heart the same vices and the same follies disgrace the literate and the illiterate who possessed a profounder knowledge of the grecian learning or was a more erudite critic than burman yet this man lived unobservant of every ordinary decency and moral duty who displayed more acuteness of mind and a wider circle of literature than the scaligers yet from the anecdotes and characters i collect of them let the reader contemplate the men  the two scaligers father and son were two prodigies of learning and of vanity schioppius has tore the mask of that principality with which the father had adorned himself for the elder scaliger maintained that he was descended from the princes of verona schioppius says and he is now credited that he was originally named jules burden that he was born in the shop of a gilder had passed some part of his life with a surgeon and then became a cordelier the elevation of his mind made him aspire to honors greater than these he threw off his frock and took the degree of doctor in physic at paris in this character he appeared at venice and in piedmont he there attached himself to a prelate of the noble house of rovezza and followed him to again of which his patron was made bishop he there married the daughter of an apothecary such were the parents of joseph scaliger who finding this chimerical principality in his family passed himself for a prince and to render the impositions of his father more credible he added many of his own  naude speaks thus concerning them  they say in italy that scaligers father married at again the daughter of an apothecary though others affirm the bastard of a bishop probably of the prelate he followed his son scaliger was visited in the character of a prince at leyden  by this i think it appears that naude gives him credit for the principality for he seems not in the least to smile at the honor   the duke de nevers having paid him a visit offered him a considerable present which scaliger civilly refused  the pride of this supposititious prince who was but a poor student must have run high   schioppius adds naude must have been under the influence of some demon when he wrote so bad a book against scaliger yet menage observes of this work that joseph scaliger died of the chagrin he felt on the occasion of schioppiuss book being published entitled scaliger hypobolymaeus   yet we may observes huet say with lipsius that if the two scaligers were not actually princes they richly merited a principality for the beauty of their genius and the extent of their erudition but we can offer no apology for their ridiculous and singular haughtiness   when a friend was delineating his character the father wrote to him in these terms  endeavor to collect whatever is most beautiful in the pages of masinissa of xenophon and of plato and you may then form a portrait which however will resemble me but imperfectly  yet this man possessed little delicacy of taste as he evinces by the false judgments he passes on homer and musaeus and above all by those unformed and rude poems with which he has dishonored parnassus i have read somewhere a french sonnet by this man which is beneath criticism menage says that the collection of scaligers poems which forms a thick octavo volume will hardly find it is equal for bad composition considering them as the productions of a man of letters of a great number of epigrams there are but four or five which are in the least tolerable  huet thinks that his son composed those letters which pass under his name and as he is an exquisite judge of style we should credit his opinion but though his poetry is so destitute of spirit or grace his prose it must be allowed is excellent nothing can be more noble higher polished or more happily turned  the son possessed a finer taste his style is more flowing and easy and yet is not the less noble his writings like those of the father breathe singular haughtiness and malignity the scaligerana will convince us that he was incapable of thinking or speaking favorably of any person although he has reflected honor on his age by the extensiveness of his learning we must confess that he has not seldom fallen into gross errors even on those subjects to which he had most applied as for instance chronology which was his favorite study and although he imagined that he stretched the scepter over the realms of criticism no one has treated this topic with less felicity it was the reform of the calendar then pending at rome which engaged him in this study he wished to show the world that he was more capable than all those who had been employed if the success of this labor had depended on the extent and variety of erudition he had eminently surpassed all those who had applied to this task but he was their inferior in the solidity of his judgment in the exactness of his arguments and the profundity of his speculations when he fondly believed that he had found the quadrature of the circle he was corrected and turned into ridicule by an obscure schoolmaster who having clearly pointed out the paralogism which deceived him made his cyclometrics vanish at his touch   scaliger the father was says patin an illustrious impostor he had never been at any war nor at any court of the emperor maximilian as he pretended he passed the first thirty years of his life in one continued study afterward he threw off his monks frock and palmed on all europe the singular imposition of his being a descendant of the princes of verona who bore the name of scaliger  julius scaliger had this peculiarity in his manner of composition he wrote with such accuracy that his manuscript and the printed copy always corresponded page for page and line for line this may appear trifling information but i am persuaded that a habit of correctness in the lesser parts of composition assists the higher  george psalmanazar well known in the literary world exceeded in powers of deception any of the great impostors of learning his island of formosa was an illusion eminently bold and maintained with as much felicity as erudition and vast must have been that erudition which could on scientific principles form a language and it is grammar  de la rochefoucault the maxims of this noble author are in the hands of every one to those who choose to derive every motive and every action from the solitary principle of selflove they are inestimable they form one continued satire on human nature but they are not reconcilable to the feelings of him who trembles with the sensibilities of genius or passes through life with the firm integrity of virtue  the character of this author is thus given by segrais  the duke de la rochefoucault had not studied but he was endowed with a wonderful degree of discernment and knew perfectly well the world it was this that afforded him opportunities of making reflections and reducing into maxims those discoveries which he had made in the heart of man of which he displayed an admirable knowledge  chesterfield our english rochefoucault we are also informed possessed an admirable knowledge of the heart of man and he too has drawn a similar picture of human nature these are two noble authors whose chief studies seem to have been in courts may it not be possible allowing these authors not to have written a sentence of apocrypha that the fault lies not so much in human nature as in the nobility themselves  the fathers of the church the present criticism is drawn from the abbe longuerue he of all the fathers of the ancient christians who best have composed in latin is sulpicius severus particularly in his history  lactantius has many splendid passages scattered in his works  st augustine who had studied cicero very attentively has not however taken him for his model in his writings or rather could never approach him in any degree  st jerome has sometimes passages which may be read with pleasure but he is strangely unequal  st ambrose has endeavored to imitate cicero but there is a wide difference betwixt them  severe criticism an unmerciful critic observes that there are few books to which an author can prefix his name without trespassing upon his veracity for there is not one work which is the labor of a single person  when a poet was reproached for his plagiarisms which he probably called classical imitations he defended himself in this manner  that a painter was not less a painter nor an architect less an architect because the one purchased his colors and the other his building materials it is all pouring out of one bottle into another exclaimed stern  unhappy authors unrelenting critics  the port royal society every lover of letters must have heard of the port royal society and probably has benefited by the labors of these learned men but perhaps few have attended to their origin and to their dissolution  the society of the port royal des champs  that was the original title  took this name from a valley about six leagues from paris  in the year      le maitre a celebrated advocate renounced the bar and resigned the honor of being conseiller detat which his uncommon merit had obtained him though then only twentyeight years of age his brother de sericourt who had followed the military profession quitted it at the same time both consecrating themselves to the service of god they retired into a little house near the port royal of paris their brothers de sacy de st elm and de valmont joined them for some political reason they were constrained to remove themselves from that spot and they then fixed their residence at port royal des champs there again the court disturbed them after a residence of little more than two months but about a year afterward they again returned  with these illustrious recluses many persons of distinguished merit now retired and it was this community which has been since called the society of port royal  amongst the members was the celebrated arnauld and others whose names would reflect a luster on any society  here were no rules no vows no constitution and no cells formed prayer and study were their only occupations they applied themselves to the education of young men and initiated the rising generation into science and into virtue  racine here received his education and on his deathbed desired to be buried in the cemetery of the port royal at the feet of m hamon an amiable instance this of the poets sensibility  anne de bourbon a princess of the blood royal erected a house near the port royal and was during her life the powerful patroness of these solitary and religious men but her death happening in      gave the fatal stroke which dispersed them for ever  the envy and the fears of the jesuits and their rancour against arnauld who with such ability had exposed their designs occasioned the destruction of the port royal society  the progress of old age in new studies socrates learnt

little taste or judgment  their verses are much in the style of our cowley  trivial points monstrous metaphors and forced conceits  a true poetical taste is not pleased with such wild chimeras but requires the fine touches of nature and passion  lopes de vega in describing an afflicted shepherdess in one of his pastorals who is represented weeping near the seaside says   that the sea joyfully advances to gather her tears and that having enclosed them in shells it converts them into pearls y el mar como imbidioso a tierra por las lagrimas salia y alegre de cogerlas las guarda en conchas y convierte en perlas   gongora whom the spaniards so greatly admire and whom they distinguish amongst their poets by the epithet of the wonderful is full of these points and conceits  he imagines that

 mathusalen de las floras because methusalem lived to a greater age than the other patriarchs  in one of his odes he gives to the river of madrid the title of the duke of streams and the viscount of rivers  mancanares mancanares os que en todo el aguatismo eftois duque de arroyos y visconde de los rios   he did not venture to call it a spanish grandee for in fact it is but a shallow and dirty stream and as quevedo informs us   the mancanares is reduced during the summerseason to the melancholy condition of the wicked rich man who asks for water in the depths of hell  concerning this river

archly remarked  that it would be proper that the bridge should be sold to purchase water es menester vender la puente por comprar agua  saint evremond the character of st evremond delineated by his own hand will not be unacceptable to many readers  a french critic has observed of this writer that he had great wit and frequently has written well but there is a strange inequality throughout his works  the comparisons which he has formed betwixt some of the illustrious ancients are excellent the criticisms which he has given on several authors are valuable but in the greater part of his works he sinks to mediocrity his poetry is insipid and not the composition of genius but study his prosaic style is too full of points the antithesis was his favorite figure and he is continually employing it  this last censure i am fearful may reach the present character which he has given of himself but still it is ingenious and offers a lively picture to the imagination    i am a philosopher as far removed from superstition as from impiety a voluptuary who has not less abhorrence for debauchery than inclination for pleasure a man who has never known want nor abundance i occupy that station of life which is despised by those who possess every thing envied by those who have nothing and only relished by those who make their felicity to consist in the exercise of their reason young i hated dissipation convinced that a man must possess wealth to provide for the comforts of a long life old i disliked economy as i believed that we need not greatly dread want when we have but a short time to be miserable i am satisfied with what nature has done for me nor do i repine at fortune i do not seek in men what they have of evil that i may censure i only find out what they have ridiculous that i may be amused i feel a pleasure in detecting their follies i should feel a greater in communicating my discoveries did not my prudence restrain me life is too short according to my ideas to read all kinds of books and to load our memory with an infinite number of things at the cost of our judgment i do not attach myself to the sentiments of scientific men to acquire science but to the most rational that i may strengthen my reason sometimes i seek for the more delicate minds that my taste may imbibe their delicacy sometimes for the gayer that i may enrich my genius with their gaiety and although i constantly read i make it less may occupation than my pleasure in religion and in friendship i have only to paint myself such as i am  in friendship more tender than a philosopher and in religion as constant and as sincere as a youth who has more simplicity than experience my piety is composed more of justice and charity than of penitence i rest my confidence on god and hope every thing from his benevolence in the bosom of providence i find my repose and my felicity  corneille and addison the student who may perhaps shine a luminary of learning and of genius in the pages of his volume is found not rarely to lie obscured beneath a thick cloud in colloquial discourse  it is the superficial mind that reflects little but speaks fluently and that appears to the vulgar who are better judges of the quantity than of the quality of words a constellation of abilities  if you love the man of letters seek him in the privacies of his study or if he be a man of virtue take him to your bosom it is in the hour of confidence and tranquillity his genius may elicit a ray of intelligence more fervid than the labors of polished composition  the great peter corneille whose genius resembled that of our shakespeare and who has so forcibly expressed the sublime sentiments of the hero had nothing in his exterior manners that indicated his genius on the contrary his conversation was so insipid that it never failed of wearying his auditors nature who had lavished on him the extraordinary gifts of genius had forgotten or rather disdained to blend with them her more ordinary ones he did not even speak correctly that language of which he was such a master  when his friends represented to him in the trite cant of the vulgar how much more he might please by not disdaining to correct these trivial errors he would smile and say  i am not the less peter corneille  the deficiencies of addison in conversation are well known he preserved a rigid silence amongst strangers but if he was silent it was the silence of meditation he probably at that moment labored more in his reflections than had he been in his study  the vulgar may talk but it is for genius to observe  the prating mandeville pert frothy and empty in his misanthropic compositions compared addison after having passed an evening in his company to a silent parson in a tyewig it is no shame for an addison to receive the censures of a mandeville they have only to blush when they call down those of a pope  vida what a consolation must it be for an aged parent to see his child by the efforts of his own merits attain from the humblest obscurity to distinguished eminence what a transport must it yield to the man of sensibility to return to the obscure dwelling of his parent and to embrace him adorned with public honors poor vida was deprived of this satisfaction but he is placed higher in our esteem by the present anecdote than even by that classic composition which rivals the art of poetry of his great master  jerome vida after having long served two popes had at length attained to the episcopacy arrayed in the robes of his new dignity he prepared to visit his aged parents and felicitated himself with the raptures which the old couple would feel in embracing their son as their bishop when he arrived at their village he learnt that it was but a few days since they were no more his sensibilities were exquisitely pained the muse elegantly querulous dictated some elegiac verse and in the sweetest pathos deplored the death and the disappointment of his parents  matthew paris a french critic has given this just and lively criticism on our historian    matthew paris an english monk is a good historian if we except his visions and his apparitions with which his work is crowded this is his worst side but in those times when they wrote history it was as essential to recount a number of miracles as it is in the present day to reject them unless they are introduced to raise a laugh  matthew paris is however sincere and frank and without laboring at delineating the portraits of his heroes he presents us with all the ideas which are necessary to be given and this is more pleasing to me than that vile affectation of continually drawing elaborate portraits the great number of which disgust and render the veracity of the author frequently suspected  will not this last censure fall heavy on the characters which smollet has given us at the conclusion of every reign of our monarchs does not the author more frequently delineate the image of imagination than that of historic truth  the numeral figures the numeral figures                   which we now employ began to be made use of in europe for the first time in    0 in the alphonsean tables made by the order of alphonso son of ferdinand king of castile who employed for this purpose isaac hazan a jew singer of the synagogue of toledo and aben ragel an arabian the arabs took them from the indians in  00 the other eastern nations received them through the means of the spaniards in a short time after their invasions the first greek who made use of them was plenudes in a work dedicated to michael paleologus in    0 so that the greeks had them not from the arabs but the latins  these ciphers were first used at paris in      and became generally used in england as dr wallis thinks about the year    0 but this has been a point hitherto very disputable and if the present account which is taken from the accurate menage be just it will appear still more so  conception and expression there are men who have just thoughts on every subject but it is not perceived because their expressions are feeble they conceive well but they produce badly  erasmus acutely observed alluding to what then much occupied his mind that one might be apt to swear that they had been taught in the confessional cell all they had learnt so scrupulous are they of disclosing what they know others again conceive ill and produce well for they express with elegance frequently what they do not know  it was observed of one pleader that he knew more than he said and of another that he said more than he knew  books of love and devotion the agreeable menage has this acute observation on the writings of love and religion  books of devotion and those of love are alike bought the only difference i find is that there are more who read books of love than buy them and there are more who buy books of devotion than read them  geographical diction  there are many sciences menage on which we cannot indeed write in a florid or elegant diction  such as geography music algebra geometry etc cicero who had been entreated by atticus to write on geography excused himself and observed that it is scenes were more adapted to please the eye than susceptible of the rich ornaments of a polished style however in these kinds of science we must supply by some little words of erudition the absence of the flowers of elegant diction  thus if we are to notice some inconsiderable place for instance andelis in adding that it was the birthplace of turnebus as calepin has done this erudition pleases even more than all the flowery ornaments of rhetoric  saints carrying their heads in their hands illiterate persons have imagined that the representation of a saint in this manner was meant to show a miracle of this kind but we must do justice to these saints by wiping away the obloquy of endeavoring to impose on us this supernatural action  it was the custom of the painters when they drew saints who had suffered decapitation to place their heads in their hands to mark the species of martyrdom they suffered and the headless trunk at the same time would have had a very repulsive effect  it is said that when a lord in the rebellion of      was committed to prison on suspicion of corresponding with the pretender he caused himself to be painted in the character of st denis carrying his head in his hand  noblemen turned critics i offer to the contemplation of those unfortunate mortals who are necessitated to undergo the criticisms of lords this pair of anecdotes   a cardinal having caused a statue to be made at rome by the great angelo when it was finished he came to inspect it and having for some time sagaciously considered it poring now on the face then on the arms the knees the form of the leg and at length on the foot itself the statue being of such perfect beauty he found himself at a loss to display his powers of criticism but by lavishing his praise but he recollected that only to praise might appear as if there had been an obtuseness in the keenness of his criticism he trembled to find a fault but a fault must be found at length he ventured to mutter something concerning the nose it might he thought be something more grecian angelo differed from his grace but he said he would attempt to gratify his taste he took up his chissel and concealed some marbledust in his hand and feigning to retouch the part he adroitly let fall some of the dust he held concealed the cardinal observing it fall transported at the idea of his critical acumen exclaimed  ah angelo you have now given to it an inimitable grace  when pope was first introduced to read his iliad to lord halifax the noble critic did not venture to be dissatisfied with so perfect a composition but like the cardinal this passage and that word this turn and that expression formed the broken cant of his criticisms the honest poet was stung with vexation for in general the parts at which his lordship hesitated were those of which he was most satisfied as he returned home with sir samuel garth he revealed to him the anxiety of his mind oh replied garth laughing you are not so well acquainted with his lordship as myself he must criticize at your next visit read to him those very passages as they now stand tell him that you have recollected his criticisms and i will warrant you of his approbation of them this is what i have done a hundred times myself pope made use of this stratagem it took like the marbledust of angelo and my lord like the cardinal exclaimed  dear pope they are now inimitable  the art of criticism an eminent french writer has thus very ingeniously traced the origin of criticism  the art of criticism is by no means a modern invention but it must be confessed that in the last age alone it has reached it is present degree of perfection  according to dion chrysostom aristotle is the inventor of criticism it is at least certain that it appeared about his time  aristarchus who flourished at samos about one hundred and fifty years before the christian era wrote nine books of corrections of the iliad and odyssey and spread a general alarm amongst the race of authors insomuch that to the present day a critic and an aristarchus are synonimous words  as the sciences were for a long time neglected criticism shared the same fate there were however even in the most barbarous ages a few learned men who cultivated it at the restoration of letters criticism by the efforts of many celebrated scholars sprung up with new vigor but two important events contributed equally to the revival of letters and of criticism the taking of constantinople by the turks which occasioned several of the learned to retire into italy and france and the invention of printing which was discovered about that time  as soon as this admirable art was made public they applied themselves to publishing excellent editions of all the good authors according to the most correct manuscripts they were indefatigable in their researches for the most ancient copies and they collated them with the modern ones by the strictest rules of criticism  some formed dictionaries and grammars of different languages and some commentaries for illustrating the text others composed treatises on fabulous history on the religion government and the military operations of the ancients they dwelt on the minutest particularities which concerned their manners their apparel their repasts their amusements etc in a word they neglected nothing which after so wide an interval might throw new lights on what remained of the grecian and the roman compositions  the learned of the sixteenth century made new efforts not only to clear the uncultivated lands of the republic of letters which had remained unexplored by their predecessors but also to improve those they had inherited they prided themselves in the freest discussions they rummaged every library to bring to light unnoticed manuscripts they compared them together they arranged those historical facts which were necessary to restore the texts and to six the dates and they were careful above all things not to decide on the sense of a passage without a mature examination and a laborious collation  yet after the immense labors of justus lipsius the scaligers turnebus budaeus erasmus and so many other learned men criticism still remained imperfect and it is only in the last age that it attained to the height which it now has reached  this perfection of criticism is owing to the establishment of academies particularly those of the french and the belles lettres academies in their labors may be found those numerous and judicious remarks which had escaped the penetration of the first scholars in europe  i cannot quit this article without observing that it is much to the dishonor of the national character no academy dedicated to the belles lettres has ever been established to raise such an academy is a glory still reserved for an augustan monarch  louis xiv has all his foibles forgiven by posterity when they contemplate the munificent patronage he bestowed on men of letters the splendours of royalty and the trophies of ambition may elevate the voice of adulation but they expire with the hero and the monarch the beneficial influence of literature is felt through successive ages and they indeed are the benefactors of mankind who bestow on posterity their most refined pleasures and their most useful speculations  the absent man with the character of bruyeres absent man it is probable the reader is well acquainted it is translated in the spectator and it has been exhibited on the theater the general opinion runs that it is a fictitious character or at least one the author has too highly colored it was well known however to his contemporaries to be the count de brancas the present anecdotes concerning the same person have been unknown to or forgotten by bruyere and as they are undoubtedly genuine and at the same time to the full as extraordinary as those which characterize menalcas or the absent man it is but reasonable to suppose that the character however improbable it may appear is a faithful delineation from nature  one day when the count was walking in the street the duke de la rochefoucault crossed the way to speak to him god bless thee poor man exclaimed the count rochefoucault smiled and was beginning to address him  is it not enough cried the count interrupting him and somewhat in a passion is it not enough that i have said at first i have nothing for you such lazy beggars as you hinder a gentleman from walking the streets rochefoucault burst into a loud laugh and awakening the absent man from his lethargy he was not a little surprised himself that he should take his friend for an importunate mendicant  the count was reading by the fireside but heaven knows with what degree of attention when the nurse brought him his infantchild he throws down the book he takes the child in his arms  he was playing with her when an important visitor was announced having forgot he had quitted his book and that it was his child he held in his hands he threw her down violently on the table and probably was surprised to hear loud cries issue from his book  metaphors cardinal perron has a very judicious criticism on metaphors cicero compares them to virgins who should not too familiarly show themselves and who must appear without affection we frequently meet with many that are not only vicious but disgustful and have nothing of that by which cicero is desirous they should be distinguished  is it possible that some authors are ignorant that style is meant to delight and if they write vicious and disgustful metaphors should they even convey to the reader their meaning they must offend  such as those which a fanatical preacher employed when he called on the lord to wipe his lips with the napkin of his love and when he talked of the lamp of love and the candle of divine grace  bishop latimer preached in the year      a sermon in which he says  now ye have heard what is meant by this first card and how ye ought to play i purpose again to deal unto you another card of the same suit for they be of so nigh affinity that one cannot be well played without the other  about the middle of the seventeenth century a country minister  fuller informs us  imitated these ridiculous allusions of latimer but the congregation now somewhat more refined than in the good bishops time could not refrain from immoderate peals of laughter  perron observes that in employing metaphors we must not descend from the general to the particular we may be allowed to say  the flames of love but not the candle the lamp and the wick of love saint anselm exclaims   draw me o lord that i may run after thee fasten me with the cords of thy love the metaphor is a little similitude or an abridgment of a similitude  it must pass quick we must not dwell upon it when it is too far continued it is vicious and degenerates into an enigma  pere bouhours also observes that metaphors must not be continued too far and that when they are thus overstrained they become trifling and frigid these two instances will explain what is here meant   an italian on his return from poland said that the persons of that country were as white as their snows but that they were even colder than they were white and that frequently from their conversations he caught a cold  costar says that the lectures of malherbe were satiating and cloying to a degree  so as to destroy the appetite of those who heard them and to save them the expense of a dinner  of the first it is to be observed that cold as a figure is an established metaphor but that from this cold we are likely to catch one is what passes the just limits of the metaphor as well as those lectures which cloyed till they occasioned a loss of appetite and saved the expense of a dinner  it was saying enough that they were satiating and disagreeable without adding the rest which goes to such an extreme and which is not likely this however must be understood when the author speaks in a serious style for if he means to employ such metaphors with levity and in joking they would then not shock us because when we laugh we may be allowed great latitude and according to aristotle and quintilian whenever we joke the falsest thoughts have in some measure a true sense  to illustrate this criticism let us try these two thoughts which however carried far have great merit when we reflect on the manner in which they must be understood  an ancient satirist says that if we wish to temper an overheated bath we have only to beg a certain rhetorician to enter because he was remarkable for frigidity in his discourses a modern satirist declares he was lately frozen at reading a certain elegy of a miserable poetaster and that the polar frosts do not by many degrees approach it  gibbon the present article is the communication of a literary friend i repose with firm security on it is justness but i cannot now turn to the passages it criticizes  i had remarked in reading gibbon two matters in which he has been grossly mistaken one was the standard of our english coin when he compares it in a note with that of some foreign coin he had to estimate the other point was when in speaking of a religious sect who used to fast on certain days he adds  they probably derived this custom from that of the jews fasting on their sabbath this is a flagrant error since it has always been their custom rather to indulge in festal enjoyments on that day it is with them a rule to observe no fast on the sabbath though it might be the anniversary of the most remarkable event the day of expiation is the only fast permitted to be kept on the seventh day i have endeavored to find out these passages but have hitherto been unsuccessful i am certain however my memory does not mislead me  innovation to the same ingenious friend i am indebted for the present and two subsequent articles  the following short extract from a french writer about the year   00 may serve to show that the cry against innovation is not peculiar to the clergy of the present day even against the opinions of the most moderate amongst their own body   such persons were the brave bishops of the lionnois who assembled a synod to reform the regulations of saint anthony in that province the monks of that place were distinguished by the title of the hogs of saint anthony they afflicted themselves with the pains of making eight repasts in one day to show the weakness of human nature  there were some jesuits and some young bishops who made fine harangues and long ones too to demonstrate that such constitutions admit of change habita ratione temporum that what our ancestors had done with a good intention was at this day ridiculous but to all these reasons the subprior of saint anthony only replied snoring with this grave and remarkable sentence  let us keep ourselves in our time from novelties  the contest was renewed with vigor on the other side but the subprior with his triple chin persisted in the same argument stammering out  let us keep  let us keep  keep ourselves  etc  however silly this reply of our wellfed prior may seem it is the same which has now the force to resist all the salutary reforms which reason and goodsense so loudly call for in institutions not only rendered obsolete by time but defective and unjust in their original principles it is the same grave and unmeaning exclamation which from the mouth of a senator obstructs an equal representation and from that of an archbishop a revival of articles which few can believe though so many are bound to profess  on the custom of saluting after sneezing some catholics  says father feyjoo  have attributed the origin of this custom to the ordinance of a pope  saint gregory  who is said to have instituted a short prayer to be used on such occasions at a time when a pestilence raged the crisis of which was attended by sneezing and in most cases followed by death  the rabbis have a tale that before jacob men never sneezed but once and then immediately died but that that patriarch obtained the revocation of this law the memory of which was ordered to be preserved in all nations by a command of every prince to his subjects to employ some salutary exclamation after the act of sneezing  these accounts are probably alike fabulous the pious fictions of pious men both because  continues feyjoo  the enquiries of aristotle concerning this strange circumstance and the allusions to it in apuleius petronius pliny and others prove it to have existed many ages prior to saint gregory and it is related in a memoir of the french academy of sciences to have been found practiced in the new world on the first discovery of america this is not only said to be a fact but some writers also give us an amusing account of the ceremonies which attend the sneezing of a king of monomotapa  those who are near his person when this happens salute him in so loud a tone that those who are in the antichamber hear it and join in the acclamation those who are in the adjoining apartments do the same until the noise reaches the street and becomes propagated throughout the city so that at each sneeze of his majesty results a most horrid cry from the saluations of many thousands of his vassals  that a custom so universally prevalent should have no plausible reason to support it is rather curious  bon aventures de periers a happy art in the relation of a story is doubtless a very agreeable talent  it has obtained la fontaine all the applause his charming naivete deserves   bon aventures de periers varlet de chamber de la royne de navarre of whom the french have a little volume of tales in prose is in my opinion not inferior to him in the facility and sportiveness of his vein his style is now in many places obsolete neither could we frequently discover his sense without the aid of his ingenious commentators particularly m de la monnoye from whose edition in three volumes i have extracted the following short anecdote not as the best specimen of our scarce author but as it introduces a novel etymology of a word in great use   a student at law who studied at poitiers had tolerably improved himself in cases of equity not that he was overburthened with learning but his chief deficiency was a want of assurance and confidence to display his knowledge his father passing by poitiers recommended him to read aloud and to render his memory more prompt by a continued exercise to obey the injunctions of his father he determined to read at the ministry in order to obtain a certain assurance he went every day into a garden which was a very secret spot being at a distance from any house and where there grew a great number of fine large cabbages thus for a long time as he pursued his studies he went to repeat his lesson to these cabbages addressing them by the title of gentlemen and dealing out his sentences as if they had composed an audience of scholars at a lecture after having prepared himself thus for a fortnight or three weeks he began to think it was high time to take the chair imagining that he should be able to harangue the scholars as well as he had before done his cabbages he comes forward he begins his oration  but before he had said a dozen words he remained dumb and became so confused that he knew not where he was so that all he could bring out was  domini ego been video quod non estis caules that is to say  for there are some who will have every thing in plain english  gentlemen i now clearly see you are not cabbages in the garden he could conceive the cabbages to be scholars but in the chair he could not conceive the scholars to be cabbages  the hall of the school of equity at poitiers where the institutes were read was called la ministry on which head florimond de remond book vii chapter    speaking of albert babinot one of the first disciples of calvin after having said he was called the good man adds that because he had been a student of the institutes at this ministry of poitiers calvin and others styled him mr minister from whence afterward calvin took occasion to give the name of ministers to the pastors of his church  de thou de thou is the livy of the french nation i will not dwell on the purity and the elegance of his style his deep penetration into the mysteries of the cabinets of princes nor on his accuracy his impartiality and in a word his historic excellence i refer the reader for a character of this historian to a paper in the essays of the ingenious mr knox i offer only a trait of his eloquence which at once shows the man was not less amiable than the historian was admirable   how much exclaims bourbon does the perusal of the history of the president de thou make a reader wish if he is possessed of a feeling heart fervidly to wish to meet in his friend a soul like his he preserved inviolable the ties of friendship attentive to fill the duties which it exacts he did not only render all the services he could to his friends but he sought every occasion to distinguish them by praise and he did this with such an effusion of tender sentiment and ingenuous ardour that envy herself could not take offense at the eulogiums of a rival after having filled a page with the praises of pierre pithou he closes his eulogium by adding that he would say more  if he was not his friend  religious enmity i think the present article which i have drawn from naude while it contains some pleasing anecdotes is just and philosophical   when i was at rome i could not help telling many devotees that when religion seizes and overpowers the mind it makes it consider actions and characters through the medium of interest and hence it should not be relied on for instance the ancient fathers have said every thing they could imagine to depreciate the character of julian the apostate though they had not done this had he not proved an apostate and a persecutor of the christians they do not in the slightest manner notice his many eminent qualities he was rigorously just a man of strict morals and a great politician see what montaigne and la mothe le vayer observe of him and particularly his character elaborately delineated by mr gibbon  it is thus also in venice anthony bragadin passes for a martyr because he was flayed alive at the command of mustapha after the taking of famagusta but the fact is that the turks are only like other men and they thus punished bragadin and his other christian captains because when they saw they must be taken by mustapha they barbarously cut the throats of all their turkish prisoners  it is owing also to this cause that the devotees say every thing favorable of mary stuart queen of scotland because she attended mass very constantly though it must be confessed that her conduct was seldom regulated by decency and morality i saw at rome  adds naude  the letters she wrote to the earl of bothwell subactori suo and i cannot but believe whatever has been said of her by buchanan and de thou  it is probable that mr whitaker and the few who are possessed with the same quixotism will not agree with this last sentiment of naude  the monk turned author the prior of one of the most celebrated convents in paris had reiteratedly entreated varillas the historian to come to examine a work composed by one of his monks and of which  not being himself addicted to letters  he wished to be governed by his opinion varillas at length yielded to the entreaties of the prior and to regale the critic they laid on two tables for his inspection seven enormous volumes in folio  this rather disheartened our reviewer but greater was his astonishment when having opened the first volume he found it is title to be summa deiparae and as saint thomas had made a sum or system of theology so our monk had formed a sum of the virgin he immediately comprehended the design of our good father who had labored on this work full thirty years and who boasted he had treated three thousand questions concerning the virgin of which he flattered himself not a single one had ever yet been imagined by any one but himself  perhaps a more extraordinary design was never known varillas pressed to give his judgment on this work advised the prior with great prudence and goodnature to amuse the honest old monk with the hope of printing these seven folios but always to start some new difficulties for it would be inhuman to give so deep a chagrin to a man who had reached his   th year as to inform him of the nature of his favorite occupations and that after his death he should throw the volumes into the fire  grotius perhaps the most sincere eulogium and the most grateful to this illustrious scholar was that which he received at the hour of his death  when this great man was traveling to holland he was suddenly struck by the hand of death at the village of rostock the parish minister who was called in his last moments ignorant who the dying man was began to go over the trite and ordinary things said on those occasions grotius who saw there was no time to lose in frivolous exhortations as he found himself almost at the last gasp turned to him and told him that he needed not those exhortations and he concluded by saying sum grotius  i am grotius tu magnus ille grotius  what are you the great grotius interrogated the minister what an eulogium  on the adjective  pretty  a young man says menage told me the other day that the verses of mr huet were  pretty they are more than  pretty i answered him you are like him who having for the first time in his life seen the sea should exclaim  it was a pretty thing it was thus also a puny officer in talking of the marechal de turenne said he was a pretty man the father of the young officer who was present turned to him with an austerity in his countenance he was little accustomed to wear  and you are a pretty fool thus to characterize the greatest man in france the sterling weight of words is not always known to our juvenile critics  a popes latin favoriti secretary to the late pope says menage reading to him the latin briefs he had composed and translated for the benefit of his holiness who knew not a word of latin the pope shed tears of joy and exclaimed  care favoriti cosa diranno di noi nella posterita quando vederanno cosi bella latinita nostra dear favoriti what will not posterity say of us when they read our beautiful latin  astrology a belief in judicial astrology i conceive now to exist only in the lower classes of the people who may be said to have no belief at all for the sentiments of those who are incapable of reflection can hardly be said to amount to a belief but a faith in this ridiculous system in our country is of very late existence  when charles the first was confined an astrologer was consulted for what hour would be most favorable to effect his escape  a story which strongly proves how greatly charles the second was bigoted to judicial astrology and whose mind was certainly not unenlightened is recorded in burnets history of his own times  dryden cast the nativities of his sons and what is remarkable his prediction relating to his son charles took place this incident is of so late a date one might hope it would have been cleared up but if it is a fact we must allow it affords a rational exultation to it is irrational adepts  alchymy it was but the other day i read an advertisement in a newspaper from one who pretends to have made great discoveries in the hermetic art with the assistance of a little money he could  positively assure the lover of this science that he would repay him a thousand fold this science if it merits to be distinguished by the name is most certainly an imposition which striking on the feeblest part of the human mind has so frequently been successful in carrying on it is delusions  as late as the days of mrs manley the authoress of the atalantis is there on record a most singular delusion of alchymy the recollection whether it was herself or another person on whom it was practiced has now escaped me from the circumstances it is very probable the sage was not less deceived than his patroness  it appears that an infatuated lover of this delusive art met with one who pretended to have the power of transmuting lead to gold this hermetic philosopher required only the materials and time to perform his golden operations he was taken to the country residence of his patroness a long laboratory was built and that his labors might not be impeded by any disturbance no one was permitted to enter into it his door was contrived to turn round on a spring so that unseen and unseeing his meals were conveyed to him without distracting the sublime contemplations of the sage  during a residence of two years he never condescended to speak but two or three times in the year to his infatuated patroness when she was admitted into the laboratory she saw with pleasing astonishment stills immense cauldrons long flues and three or four vulcanian fires blazing at different corners of this magical mine nor did she behold with less reverence the venerable figure of the dusty philosopher pale and emaciated with daily operations and nightly vigils he revealed to her in unintelligible jargon his progresses and having sometimes condescended to explain the mysteries of the arcana she beheld or seemed to behold streams of fluid and heaps of solid ore scattered around the laboratory sometimes he required a new still and sometimes vast quantities of lead already this unfortunate lady had expended the half of her fortune in supplying the demands of the philosopher she began now to lower her imagination to the standard of reason two years had now elapsed vast quantities of lead had gone in and nothing but lead had come out she disclosed her sentiments to the philosopher he heartily confessed he was himself surprised at his tardy processes but that now he would exert himself to the utmost and that he would venture to perform a laborious operation which hitherto he had hoped not to have been necessitated to employ his patroness retired and the golden visions of expectation resumed all their luster  one day as they sat at dinner a terrible shriek and one crack followed by another loud as the report of cannon assailed their ears they hastened to the laboratory two of the greatest stills had burst one part of the laboratory was in flames and the deluded philosopher scorched to death  an author who wrote in the year   0  presents us with the following anecdote concerning an alchymical speculation   the late duke of buckingham being overpersuaded by a pack of knaves who called themselves chemical operators that they had the secret of producing the philosophers stone but wanted money to carry on the process his grace engaged to assist them with money to carry on the work and performed his promise at a vast expense a laboratory was built utensils provided and the family filled with the most famous artists in the transmutation of metals  adepts of a superior class who would concern themselves only about the grand elixir and a pack of shabby curs to attend the fires and do other servile offices and yet forsooth must be also called philosophers   this great charge continued upon the duke for some years for whoever was unpaid or whatever was neglected money must be found to bear the charge of the laboratory and pay the operators till this chimera with other extravagancies had caused the mortgaging and selling many fine manors lordships towns and good farms   all this time nothing was produced by these sons of art of any value for either the glass broke or the man was drunk and let out the fire or some other misfortune still attended the grand process at the time assigned for a je ne scai quoi to be produced that must turn all things to gold the duke encountering nothing but disappointments and the operators finding themselves slighted and money very difficult to be had the project fell  penotus who died at ninetyeight years of age in the hospital of sierdon in switzerland had spent nearly his whole life in researches after the philosophers stone and being at length from affluent circumstances reduced to beggary and reason was accustomed to say  that if he had a mortal enemy that he durst not encounter openly he would advise him above all things to give himself up to the study and practice of alchymy  every philosophical mind must be convinced that alchymy is not an art which some have fancifully traced to the remotest times it may be rather regarded when opposed to such a distance of time as a modern imposture caesar commanded the treatises of alchymy to be burnt throughout the roman dominions and this shows the opinion of one who is not less to be admired as a philosopher than as a monarch  mr gibbon has this succinct passage relative to alchymy  the ancient books of alchymy so liberally ascribed to pythagoras to solomon or to hermes were the pious frauds of more recent adepts the greeks were inattentive either to the use or the abuse of chemistry in that immense register where pliny has deposited the discoveries the arts and the errors of mankind there is not the least mention of the transmutations of metals and the persecution of dioclesian is the first authentic event in the history of alchymy the conquest of egypt by the arabs diffused that vain science over the globe congenial to the avarice of the human heart it was studied in china as in europe with equal eagerness and equal success the darkness of the middle ages ensured a favorable reception to every tale of wonder and the revival of learning gave new vigor to hope and suggested more specious arts to deception philosophy with the aid of experience has at length banished the study of alchymy and the present age however desirous of riches is content to seek them by the humbler means of commerce and industry  after this will it be credited that even in this enlightened age a writer should stand forth as it is advocate mr andrews in his anecdotes has an article concerning alchymy his account of nicholas flamel is not accurate he attributes his mysterious prosperity to that great secret which has been sought for through ages and which to this day has it is believers of these believers undoubtedly mr andrews is one  the athenian tribunal for dramatic composition the athenians established a tribunal composed of five judges to give their verdict on the merits of compositions destined for the theater and to decide if they deserved a public representation the romans had a similar tribunal  to give an instance of the critical severity of these judges  they even arraigned at their bar euripides to make his defense for having permitted one of his dramatic characters impiously to say that he had made a vow with his tongue to the gods but not with the intention of performing it euripides defended himself by supplicating the critics patiently to wait till the conclusion of the piece when they would see that character broken on the wheel  if such a tribunal of criticism was established at london it would render the stage more instructive than it is at present we might probably have fewer wretched operas such vapors of wit and dregs of the imagination would be purged away from the purity of dramatic composition  the florence professor at florence they have established a professor chosen from amongst the most eminent of the della crusca academicians who professes publicly the italian language it was thus also the romans established a similar student who dedicated his life to the profession of their language  i cannot but wish that an academy or at least a professorship were founded in england for the preservation of our language they might censure any faulty innovations which appeared in the style of those compositions which were likely to become extensive in their circulation they might detect the tinsel of della crusca the gallicisms of gibbon and the scotticisms of blair on their earliest publication they would compel our authors to be more vigilant and we might thus be enabled to leave our heirs the rich inheritance of a classical style who in their gratitude would recompense our labors by delivering it down to posterity uncontaminated  swift and other good judges of the purity of the english language have testified their desire for such an establishment and although i have not forgotten the sentiments of johnson on this occasion i cannot but oppose them had there been such an academy or professorship founded in the days the rambler was published posterity would have read as many protests against the pedantic latinity of his english as there are papers in that work he seems to have been sensible though somewhat late of his error for his biographical style is indeed a classical standard of the english language it was then he most cordially praised the addisonian periods akenside has committed the same violations in verse which johnson has in prose  inequalities of genius we observe frequently great inequalities in the labors of genius and particularly in those which admit great enthusiasm as in poetry in painting and in music but surely this is not difficult to be accounted for faultless mediocrity industry can preserve in one continued degree but excellence is only to be attained by human faculties by starts  our poets who possess the greatest genius with perhaps the least industry have at the same time the most splendid and the worst passages of poetry shakespeare and dryden are at once the greatest and the least of our poets  the imitative powers of pope who possessed more industry than genius  though his genius was nearly equal to that of the greatest poets  has contrived to render every line faultless yet it may be faid of pope that his greatest fault consists in having none  carrache sarcastically said of tintoret  ho veduto il tintoretto hora eguale a titiano hora minore del tintoretto  i have seen tintoret now equal to titian and now less than tintoret  the student in the metropolis a man of letters who is more intent on the acquisitions of literature than on the plots of politics or the speculations of commerce will find a deeper solitude in a populous metropolis than if he had retreated to the seclusion of the country the student as he does not flatter the malevolent passions of men will not be much incommoded with their presence a letter which descartes wrote to balzac  who incapable as he found his great soul to bend to the servilities of the courtier was  to retire from court  will illustrate  timents with great force and vivacity descartes then resided in the commercial city of amsterdam and thus writes to balzac    you wish to retire and your intention is to seek the solitude of the chartreux or possibly some of the most beautiful provinces of france and italy i would rather advise you if you wish to observe mankind and at the same time to be plunged into the deepest solitude to join me in amsterdam i prefer this situation to that even of your delicious villa where i spent so great a part of the last year for however agreeable a country house may be a thousand little conveniences are wanted which can only be found in a city one is not alone so frequently in the country as one could wish a number of impertinent visitors are continually besieging you here as all the world except myself is occupied in commerce it depends merely on myself to live unknown to the world i walk every day amongst immense ranks of people with as much tranquillity as you do in your green alleys the men i meet with make the same impression on my mind as would the trees of your forests or the flocks of sheep grazing on your common the busy hum too of these merchants does not disturb one more than the purling of your brooks if sometimes i amuse myself in contemplating their anxious motions i receive the same pleasure which you do in observing those men who cultivate your land for i reflect that the end of all their labors is to embellish the city which i inhabit and to anticipate all my wants if you see with delight the fruits of your orchards which promise you such rich crops do you think i feel less in observing so many fleets that convey to me the productions of either india what spot on earth could you find which like this can so interest your vanity and gratify your taste  physiognomy and palmistry every one seems not a little to have studied lavater so that  if the expression does not offend  most men are ashamed to show their faces perhaps it is not generally known that an ancient greek author has written on physiognomy this work is translated into latin by the count charles de montecuculli enriched with very learned annotations  one walfon assured george weller who published his travels into dalmatia greece and the levant  a very curious work  that he had purchased a chestfull of very scarce arabic books amongst which was a treatise on chiromancy more curious than that of john baptiste porta in which the author shows that the lines in the hand are letters of which he presents the reader with an alphabet  the following curious physiological definition of physiognomy is extracted from a publication by dr gwither of the year   0     soft wax cannot receive more various and numerous impressions than are imprinted on a mans face by objects moving his affections and not only the objects themselves have this power but also the very images or ideas that is to say any thing that puts the animal spirits into the same motion that the object present did will have the same effect with the object to prove the first let one observe a mans face looking on a pitiful object then a ridiculous then a strange then on a terrible or dangerous object and so forth for the second that ideas have the same effect with the object dreams confirm too often   the manner i conceive to be thus  the animal spirits moved in the sensory by an object continue their motion to the brain whence the motion is propagated to this or that particular part of the body as is most suitable to the design of it is creation having first made an alteration in the face by it is nerves especially by the pathetic and oculorum motorii actuating it is many muscles as the dialplate to that stupendous piece of clockwork which shows what is to be expected next from the striking part not that i think the motion of the spirits in the sensory continued by the impression of the object all the way as from a finger to the foot i know it too weak though the tenseness of the nerves favors it but i conceive it done in the medulla of the brain where is the common stock of spirits as in an organ whose pipes being uncovered the air rushes into them but the keys let go are stopped again now if by repeated acts or frequent entertaining of the ideas of a favorite idea of a passion or vice which natural temperament has hurried one to or custom dragged the face is so often put into that posture which attends such acts that the animal spirits find such latent passages into it is nerves that it is sometimes unalterably set as the indian religious are by long continuing in strange postures in their pagods but most commonly such a habit is contracted that it falls insensibly into that posture when some present object does not obliterate that more natural impression by a new or dissimulation hide it   hence it is that we see great drinkers with eyes generally set toward the nose the adducent muscles being often employed to let them see their loved liquor in the glass at the time of drinking which were therefore called bibitory lascivious persons are remarkable for the oculorum mobilis petulanta as petronius calls it from this also we may solve the quakers expecting face waiting the pretended spirit and the melancholy face of the sectaries the studious face of men of great application of mind revengeful and bloody men like executioners in the act and though silence in a sort may awhile pass for wisdom yet sooner or later saint martin peeps through the disguise to undo all a changeable face i have observed to show a changeable mind but i would by no means have what has been said understood as without exception for i doubt not but sometimes there are found men with great and virtuous souls under very unpromising outsides  characters described by musical notes the present communication is made by an ingenious young friend it is an extract from a volume of philosophical transactions and collections published at the end of the year   00 and the curious conjectures it contains being perfectly novel to me  my friend observes  may perhaps be so to you and many others  the idea of describing characters under the names of musical instruments has been already displayed the two most pleasing papers which embellish the tatler are written by addison he there dwells on this idea with uncommon success and it has been applauded for it is originality let it however be recollected that the following paper was published in the year   00 and the two numbers of addison in the year    0 it is probable that this inimitable writer borrowed his ideas from this work in the general preface to the tatler his papers on this similar subject are distinguished for their felicity of imagination   a conjecture at dispositions from the modulations of the voice   sitting in some company and having been but a little before musical i chanced to take notice that in ordinary discourse words were spoken in perfect notes and that some of the company used eighths some fifths some thirds and that his discourse which was most pleasing his words as to their tone consisted most of concords and were of discords of such as made up harmony the same person was the most affable pleasant and bestnatured in the company this suggests a reason why many discourses which one hears with much pleasure when they come to be read scarce seem the same things   from this difference of music in speech we may conjecture that of tempers we know the doric mood sounds gravity and sobriety the lydian buxomness and freedom the aeolic sweet stilness and quiet composure the phrygian jollity and youthful levity the ionic is a stiller of storms and disturbances arising from passion and why may we not reasonably suppose that those whose speech naturally runs into the notes peculiar to any of these moods are likewise in nature hereunto congenerous c fa ut may show me to be of an ordinary capacity though good disposition g sol re ut to be peevish and effeminate flats a manly or melancholic sadness he who has a voice which will in some measure agree with all cliffs to be of good parts and fit for variety of employments yet somewhat of an inconstant nature likewise from the times so semibriefs may speak a temper dull and phlegmatic minums grave and serious crotchets a prompt wit quavers vehemence of passion and scolds use them semibriefrest may denote one either stupid or fuller of thoughts than he can utter minumrest one that deliberates crotchetrest one in a passion so that from the natural use of mood note and time we may collect dispositions  scripture expressions derived from customs it was an ancient ceremony of the jews which yet is religiously observed amongst them to tear their clothes in mourning and affliction some orientals still practice this custom when any thing uncommonly distressful happens the jews make use of much ceremony on this occasion  sometimes they tear from the top to the bottom and sometimes from the bottom to the top the rent must be of a particular length when it is done for the loss of parents it is never sewed for the loss of other persons it is sewed at the end of thirty days this piece of religious mummery if it is of no other value will at least serve to explain a passage in which solomon in his proverbs says that  there is a time to rend and a time to sew which means there is a time for affliction and a time for consolation many of the scripturephrases that appear unintelligible are founded on jewish customs  mr bruce in his travels observed in a cavalcade the headdress of the governors of provinces a large broad fillet was bound upon their forehead and tied behind their head in the middle of this was a horn or a conical piece of silver gilt much in the shape of our candleextinguishers this is called kirn or horn and is only worn in reviews or public rejoicings for victory this custom borrowed from the hebrews our traveller conceives will explain the several allusions made to it in scripture i said unto fools deal not foolishly and to the wicked lift not up the horn  lift not up your horn

writers who have attempted to discover the sense of the enigmas and the foolish and extravagant visions with which this work is loaded there have been some who imagined that they perceived many remarkable events which were predicted in this book others have led their imagination to behold it in another point of view and there have been even chemists who have pretended to say that the great secret of the philosophical stone was there concealed under mysterious phrases   if it is difficult  says de bure  to give a just idea of this extravagant work it is however more easy to inform the reader of it is rarity it has been long known amongst the literary connoisseurs and it is certain that nothing is more difficult than to find a complete copy some curious collectors have endeavored by sacrificing a great number of copies to join it is separate parts but they have always found their endeavors frustrated this mysterious work seems to have a mysterious conclusion  this rare volume consists  according to the most complete copy extant  of one hundred and three fugitive and separate pieces which the author caused himself to have printed and which he distributed himself in streets and houses to those persons who made him some pecuniary present as he himself informs us by the acknowledgments which he makes in some of his pieces where he puts not only the name and the quality of those to whom he presented them but also the sums which he received from each individual  the abbe ladvocat has given the following succinct account of this man  he knew the art of gaining his livelihood by distributing his extravagancies to whoever he found was willing to purchase them they contain orations sentences but more frequently prophecies many have illspent their time in explaining the mysteries of his work and as is usual in these cases every one found what he sought but the truth is they are visions which come from a head less ridiculous than those of the persons who received them with respect and recompensed them with their money unless they were guided to act thus by the benevolence of charity  after what has been laid before the reader will it be believed that a complete collection of the comte de permissions absurdities would fetch a very high price among a certain class of literati it happens however that his leaves which resemble in their design those of the roman sybils are as difficult to be found there are men who display a rich fund of erudition only by studying catalogues and feel themselves as much enchanted by the rarity of an exerable book as some by the rarity of fine writing  impositions of authors there have been some authors who have practiced singular impositions on the public varillas the french historian enjoyed for some time a great reputation in his own country for his historic compositions when they became more known the scholars of other countries destroyed the reputation he had unjustly acquired his continual professions of sincerity prejudiced many in his favor and made him pass for a writer who had penetrated into the inmost recesses of the cabinet but the public were at length undeceived and were convinced that the historical anecdotes which varillas put off for authentic facts had no foundation being wholly his own inventing  though he endeavored to make them pass for realities by affected citations of titles instructions letters memoirs and relations all of them imaginary  melchisedec thevenot librarian to the french king was never out of europe yet he has composed some folio volumes of his voyages and travels by information and memoirs which he collected from those who had traveled travels observes the compiler of the biographical dictionary related at second hand can never be of any great authority or moment assuredly not but they may be pregnant with errors of all kinds  gemelli carreri a neapolitan gentleman who for many years never quitted his chamber being confined by a tedious indisposition amused himself with writing a voyage round the world giving characters of men and descriptions of countries as if he had really visited them du halde who has written so voluminous an account of china compiled it from the memoirs of the missionaries and never traveled ten leagues from pairs in his life though he appears by his writings to be very familiar with the chinese scenery  this is an excellent observation of an anonymous author  writers who never visited foreign countries and travelers who have run through immense regions with fleeting pace have given us long accounts of various countries and people evidently collected from the idle reports and absurd traditions of the ignorant vulgar from whom only they could have received those relations which we see accumulated with such undiscerning credulity  translation the following observations on translation are offered to our modern doers into english to whom i am indebted for this article has escaped my recollection  to render a translation perfect it is necessary to attend to these rules  the translator must possess a thorough knowledge of the two languages he must be exact not only in giving the thoughts of his author but even his own words when they become essential and necessary he must preserve the spirit and peculiar genius of his author he must distinguish every character by it is manners and it is nature by unfolding the senfe and the words with suitable phrases and parallel expressions he must yield beauties by other beauties and figures by other figures whenever the idiom of language does not admit of a close version he must not employ long sentences unless they serve to render the sense more intelligible and the diction more elegant he must attempt a neatness in his manner and to effect this he must know skilfully to contract or enlarge his periods he must unite the too concise sentences of his author if his style like that of tacitus be close and abrupt he must not only sedulously attempt precision and purity of diction but he must strive also to embellish his version with those graces and images which frequently lie so closely hidden that nothing but a familiar conversancy with his author can discover them and lastly he must present us with the sentiments of his author without a servile attachment to his words or phrases but rather according to his spirit and his genius  a translator is a painter who labors after an original he must carefully reveal the traits of his model he copies he does not compose whenever he trespasses on his limits he ceases to be a translator and becomes an author  the origin of newspapers and periodical literature the newspapers of the present day contrasted with their original models have attained a degree of excellence which is flattering to modern industry to contemplate while political events are registered with a celerity unknown to our ancestors the sentiments of liberty are disseminated in the warm impression of the moment the frivolous pursuits of the age offer an ample field to those who can point with force the keenness of ridicule fashion however versatile cannot escape the eye of the satirist and the follies of the night are chronicled for the sober contemplation of the morning literature has been called in to embellish these diurnal pages and it has given a stability and perfection of which the evanescent nature of such productions was hardly thought susceptible it is however a melancholy truth that such excellent purposes have been frustrated by a vile spirit of faction a spirit that according to the sensible rapin will sooner overturn the english constitution than the united efforts of our most powerful enemies but such discussions we leave to the sagacious politicians  periodical papers seem first to have been used by the english during the civil wars of the usurper cromwell to disseminate amongst the people the sentiments of loyalty or rebellion according as their authors were disposed we seem to have been obliged to the italians for the idea and perhaps it was their gazettas  from gazzera a magpie or chatterer  which have given a name to these papers honest peter heylin in the preface to his cosmography mentions that  the affairs of each town or war were better presented to the reader in the weekly newsbooks in their origin they were solely devoted to political purposes but they soon became a public nuisance by serving as receptacles of party malice and echoing to the farthest ends of the kingdom the insolent voice of faction they set the minds of men more at variance enflamed their tempers to a greater fierceness and gave a keener edge to the sharpness of civil discord  it is to be lamented that such works will always find writers adapted to their scurrilous purposes but of a vast crowd that issued from the press though little more than a century has elapsed they are now not to be found but in a few private collections they form a race of authors unknown to most readers of these times the name of their chief however has just reached us but is on the point of disappearing  sir roger lestrange who appears to have greatly surpassed his rivals and to have been esteemed as the most perfect model of political writing merits little praise the temper of the man was factious and brutal and the compositions of the author very indifferent in his multifarious productions and meagre translations we discover nothing that indicates one amiable sentiment to compensate for a barbarous diction and a heavy load of political trash his attempts at wit are clumsy exertions the awkward efforts of a german who labors on a delicate toy when he assumes the gravity of the sage he seems more fortunate in extorting a laugh burlesquing the most solemn reflections by quaint and uncouth expression  in the reign of queen anne  not unjustly characterized by being distinguished as the augustan age of english literature  periodical prints that till then had only served political purposes began to rank higher in the estimation of the public some had already attempted to introduce literary subjects and other topics of a more general speculation but we see nothing that has escaped the waste of time till sir richard steel formed the plan of his tatler he designed it to embrace the three provinces of manners of letters and of politics he knew that this was an invaluable improvement and doubtless he thought that if the last portion could be omitted it would still have made it more perfect but violent and sudden reformation is seldom to be used and the public were to be conducted insensibly into so new and different a track from that to which they had been hitherto accustomed hence politics were admitted into his paper but it remained for the chaster genius of addison to banish this disagreeable topic from his elegant pages the writer in polite letters felt himself degraded by sinking into the dull narrator of political events it is from this time that newspapers and periodical literature became distinct works  literary composition in a little tract printed in      is to be found some curious literary information the ingenious author attempts to mark out the most profitable way of reading and writing books he first informs us of various voluminous writers of some so infected with the cacoethes scribendi that they have composed from six to seven thousand volumes he then notices vast libraries such as that of ptolomy king of egypt which was said to contain four hundred thousand or as others write seven hundred thousand volumes and also that of the younger theodosius at constantinople containing ten myriads of books  he reflects that since the invention of printing an author can publish as much in one day as he has composed in one year he laments that these multifarious volumes may prove prejudicial to the student that such a continued novelty of matter will render his knowledge less clear and digested than before this invention took place though he is willing to allow that this evil originates rather from the ill use made of books than from their number  he complains  a complaint i fear which must ever exist  that the press is continually pouring forth trivial crude and useless performances yet he observes  if men would take care that ill books be not written and that good books be not ill written but that in their composition a due regard be always had to prudence solidity perspicuity and brevity there would be no cause left for us to complain of the too great number of books  by the idea of prudence he would have us understand that an author should never rashly or inconsiderately apply himself to composition let him learn well what he purposes to teach to others the greatest scholars have always taken time to make their compositions approach perfection isocrates spent ten or as some will have it fifteen years in polishing one panegyric dion cassius employed twelve years in writing his history and ten years in preparing his memoirs virgil employed seven years to finish his bucolics and after a labor of eleven years pronounced his aeneid imperfect jacobus sannazarius wrote three books de partu virginis and dedicated twenty years to this labor diodorus siculus was thirty years in composing his history hence he advises writers to reflect on the reply of zeuxis to one who boasted of a more fluent hand in painting  diu pingo quia eternitati pingo  i paint but a line every day but i paint for posterity  in works of importance he would have us be studious of what he calls solidity he means that our arguments should be forcibly urged and skilfully applied that every thing we write tend to show that we feel ourselves the conviction of what we would convince our reader that nothing be feeble doubtful or frivolous that truth be firm clear and as indisputable as possible not as he heartily remarks that this solidity can be every where observed alike it being above the infirmity of man so to do but men should be very wary not to flatter themselves that others will believe their bare saysos  by perspicuity he requires that the style serve like a mirror to the mind of the author so that the sense may be lucidly presented to the reader as for those authors who are pleased to throw over their compositions an affected obscurity he shrewdly remarks that they might gratify their humor and the world much better by remaining silent  lastly he would not have perspicuity so far indulged as to neglect brevity for as obscurity makes a book useless so if drawn out in length it becomes tedious to observe this brevity he advises the writer not to give into wild digressions but always to keep close to his main subject to reject as much as possible trite sentiments and familiar arguments to be sparing of an idle amplification of words and in controversy not so much to combat his adversaries by number as by weight of argument  to close this slight review which i hope will not be found unuseful he exhorts the ingenuous youth not to delight in a multiplicity of authors to be select in his choice and then studiously to unite himself to those authors whom he finds most congenial to his own dispositions an excellent rule this and to conclude with a verse from the earl of roscommon  to choose an author as he would a friend  for the benefit of young authors i will add the advice of a veteran on publication   menage observes that the works which are most generally liked give a more extensive reputation than the most excellent ones which are only relished by a few connoisseurs the dishes at a feast should rather be seasoned to the taste of the invited than to that of the cooks however able they may be for as martial says   coenae fercula nostrae malim convivis quam placuisse cocis   to give a work which may be crowned with the approbation of the public it must be read three times the first perfectly to understand it the second to criticize it and the third to correct it  virgil virgil has violated the immutable laws of common sense which exist in full force in all ages and in all countries by his ridiculous miracles which are not less insupportable than those which the ancient chroniclers relate of their saints among these we may observe is that of transforming into the leaves of a tree of which polydore is the root the lances with which polymnestor had pierced him in the third book of the aeneid in making the branch of a tree produce a golden bough in the sixth and in metamorphosing into sea nymphs in the eleventh book the ships of aeneas which were set on fire the least judicious of his admirers would even defend these miracles surely these fictions are not miraculous but ridiculous and only serve to blemish so beautiful a composition  we must also condemn in virgil that cruel piety by which he has distinguished aeneas in causing him to immolate eight persons on the funeralpile of pallas the example of homer which he has here followed cannot excuse a barbarity which shocks our feelings this cruel action was characteristic of the furious achilles in the circumstance of the death of patroclus but should not have been performed by the pious aeneas besides virgil who had more judgment than homer and who lived in a more polished age is less excuseable in having made his hero commit so barbarous an action  in the fourth book of the aeneid we are compelled to animadvert on another sault which pains our sensibility in that book where the poet expresses so well the madness of a despairing lover aeneas appears by much too cold and his excuses are indeed not very ingenious for his desertion of dido  in a word not a little unfeeling to all the reproaches of the passionate and tender queen he has only to oppose the orders of jupiter and the severity of his sat he cannot doubt of the extreme violence of her passion and he must necessarily know to what an excess a woman of her fervid spirit who pretended to be united to him as his wife would carry it yet he sleeps in the most perfect tranquillity in his vessel till mercury awakens him  some of his adventures seem copies of each other sinon and acheminedes present themselves to the trojans on two very different occasions but in nearly a similar manner the one in his second book and the other in the third say the same things the descriptions of the tempests too frequently resemble each other and they begin two or three times by the same verses this beautiful verse  obstupui steteruntque comae et vox faucibus haesit is too often repeated there are also contradictions which probably he would have corrected had he lived  he relates in the fifth book the circumstances of the death of palinurus in one manner and palinurus himself in the sixth relates it differently in one it is the god of sleep under the figure of phorbas who having caused the pilot to fall asleep precipitates him and the rudder into the sea in the other it is a gale of wind that carries them both away in one place palinurus is swallowed up in a profound sleep by the sea in the other he is perfectly awake and has time to reflect that the ship will now wander without a pilot  virgil should not have caused aeneas to return from hell by the gate of ivory but by that of horn by employing here the gate of ivory from whence issued fables and fictions formed at pleasure  sed falsa ad coelum mittunt insomnia manes  is it not destroying at a single stroke the whole that he has been recounting in that incomparable book and tacitly informing augustus that all he had imagined most flattering for him and his anceftors is nothing but a mere idle fiction  in the second book of the aeneid ascanius appears a little child led by the hand of his father he could not have attained to more than seven years in the third andromache calling to mind astyanax her son and addressing herself to ascanius says  were he living he would now like you have reached the age of puberty  et nunc aequali tecum pubesceret oevo  ascanius was not then a child before he went to africa yet virgil makes him again but seven years in his fourth book when dido holds cupid in her lap who had assumed his figure yet in the very same book he is represented not as a child but as a young and vigorous man in a huntingmatch of which he gives a description  these things are very irregular and dissimilar contradictions which are very material and which cannot be reconciled virgil on his deathbed commanded his friends to burn his aeneid the great poet was conscious of it is unfinished state fortunately for posterity they did not in this respect obey the injunctions of their dying friend the loss had indeed been irreparable  let it not be considered that i have collected these criticisms to diminish the reputation of virgil his laurels are placed for above the reach of envy i am no lauder no heron but it is alone by an enlightened criticism and by contemplating the errors of our masters that we may hope if we but faintly attain to their beauties at least to escape from their errors  we can however defend virgil from a censure which attacks at once the poet and the man the cardinal sirlet turnebus muret taubman julius scaliger and others not less eminent are much astonished that virgil in his sixth book of the aeneid describing the laurel grove which he has assigned for the residence of the poets makes no mention of homer on this they have taxed virgil with ingratitude and envy since here an occasion presented itself so favorably to bestow a beautiful eulogium on homer to whom he stood so deeply indebted and they have been astonished why he preferred to do this honor to the ancient musaeus but this censure is very unjust and could only be occasioned by not reflecting sufficiently on the order of time let us consider that virgil only follows his hero if he speaks of musaeus it is that he had no other design but to mention those poets who died before the taking of troy he was too judicious to cause aeneas to relate that he had seen homer amongst the poets who was not born till at least one hundred and sixty years after the destruction of troy  virgil in the second book of the georgics has bestowed high eulogiums on the fertile territory of nole in campania but the inhabitants of this city not choosing to allow their waters to run through his lands he erased nole and put ora in it is place so dreadful is the vengeance of a poet  the banquet which alcinous gives ulysses in the odyssey is very beautiful and perfectly gallant but it appears there are none but men present that with which dido entertains aeneas is not by any means comparable to it in festal elegance in one they sing the adventures of the gods and other themes not less agreeable than gallant in the other they sing concerning the stars and other philosophical matters let the festive splendours of alcinous be removed to the court of carthage and the feast of dido to the pheacian island and every thing will then be in character  to this article may be added an account of a thirteenth book of the aeneid a poet named maphaeus vegius laudanensis  so naude writes it but i observe his commentator tells us it should be laudensis  was born at lodi in the year   0  at sixteen years of age he gave evident marks of an excellent genius what is most remarkable of him is that he has with great felicity added a thirteenth book to the aeneid has this book ever been translated into english verse  milton it is painful to observe the acrimony which the most eminent scholars infuse frequently in their controversial writings the politeness of the present times has in some degree softened the malignity of the man in the dignity of the author though it must be confessed there are living writers who pride themselves on being  as they express it  of the warburtonian school but who display the asperity rather than the erudition of a warburton  the celebrated controversy of salmasius and milton  the first the advocate of king charles the other the defender of the people  was of that magnitude that all europe took a part in the paperwar of these two great men the answer of milton who perfectly massacred salmasius is now read but by the few whatever is addressed to the times however great may be it is merit is doomed to perish with the times yet on these pages the philosopher will not contemplate in vain  it will form no uninteresting article to gather a few of the rhetorical weeds  for flowers we cannot well call them  with which they mutually presented each other their rancour was at least equal to their condition though they were the two most learned scholars of a learned age  that the deformity of the body is an idea we attach to the deformity of the mind the vulgar must acknowledge but surely it is unpardonable in the enlightened philosopher thus to compare corporeal matter with intellectual spirit yet milbourne and dennis  the last a formidable critic  have frequently considered that comparing dryden and pope to whatever the eye turned from with disgust was very good argument to lower their literary abilities salmasius seems also to have entertained this idea though his spies in england gave him wrong information or possibly he only drew the figure of his own distempered imagination  salmasius sometimes reproaches milton as being but a puny piece of man a dwarf deprived of the human figure a being composed of nothing but skin and bone a contemptible pedagogue fit only to flog his boys and sometimes elevating the ardour of his mind into a poetic frenzy he applies to him these words of virgil   monstrum horrendum inform ingens cui lumen ademptum our great poet thought this senseless declamation merited a serious refutation perhaps he did not wish to appear despicable in the eyes of the ladies if the great johnson could express his pleasure at learning that milton wore latchets to his shoes his admirers must be interested in this description of himself he says that he does not think any one ever considered him as unbeautiful that his size rather approached mediocrity than the diminutive that he still felt the same courage and the same strength which he possessed when young when with his sword he felt no difficulty to combat with men more robust than himself that his face far from being pale emaciated and wrinkled did him much credit for though he had passed his fortieth year he was in all other respects ten years younger for all this he called for testimony on multitudes who though they knew him but by sight would hold him ridiculous if he did not reveal the truth  morus in his epistle dedicatory of his clamor regii sanguinis compares milton to a hangman his disordered vision to the blindness of his soul and vomits forth so much rancour and venom that to collect his calumnies ceases to become an amusive employment  when salmasius found that his strictures on the person of milton were false and that on the contrary it was uncommonly beautiful he then turned his battery against those graces with which nature had so liberally adorned his adversary and it is now that he seems to have set no restrictions to his pen but raging with the irritation of miltons success he throws out the blackest calumnies and the most infamous aspersions  it must be observed when milton first proposed to answer salmasius he had lost the use of one of his eyes and his physicians declared that if he applied himself to the controversy the other would likewise close for ever his patriotism was not to be baffled but with life itself unhappily the prediction of his physicians took place thus a learned man in the occupations of study falls blind a circumstance which even now agonizes the heart of sensibility salmasius considers it as one from which he may draw caustic ridicule and satiric severity  salmasius glories that milton lost his health and his eyes in answering his apology for king charles he does not now reproach him with natural deformities but he malignantly sympathizes with him that he now no more is in possession of that beauty which rendered him so amiable during his residence in italy he speaks more plainly in a following page and in a word would blacken the austere virtue of milton with a crime too infamous to name  impartiality of criticism obliges us to confess that milton was not destitute of rancour and when it was told him that his adversary boasted he had occasioned the loss of his eyes he answered with the ferocity of the irritated puritan   and i shall cost him his life a prediction which was soon after verified for christina queen of sweden withdrew her patronage from salmasius and sided with milton the universal neglect the proud scholar felt in consequence hastened his death  the story of his expulsion from cambridge was not forgotten  nor forgotten to be aggravated milton denies this and relates it in a manner honorable to himself salmasius assures his reader that those who well knew milton affirm that he was incapable of latin composition but  in his manner of raillery  he confesses milton to be an extraordinary poet and this he maintains by pointing out how frequently he violates in his latin verses the laws of quantity he adds that the author might have spared himself the pains of indicating his age for without this aid his reader must have been convinced that they were the compositions of the raw scholar to close the virulence of his invectives he tells us that miltons book is written by a french schoolmaster in london and that he only lent his name  what patin writes in his letters in the same times will show what lame reports the enemies of milton helped about he writes  monsieur de la mothe le vaier informs me that the book of milton against the king of england has been burnt by the common hangman  in paris that milton is in prison and it is to be hoped will be hung some say that milton wrote this book in english and that a peter de moulin who has put it into such fine latin is in danger for his pains of being burnt this is in the usual style of patins correspondence some truth with much fiction moulin was a confessor of the royal party and was on the contrary a favorite with our second charles and who having written against the rebels was one of the few whose fidelity he rewarded  it is raking in offals to transcribe from the infamous lauder his virulence however cannot now irritate it may amuse he seems to have poached in salmasius for epithets his pamphlets with the common lies of the day have met the common fate the present paragraph is an odd mixture of pedantry of vile composition and viler abuse   milton whom the present generation of writers if they do not on some occasions exeem from some human frailties and imperfections have yet in the main conspired to daub with the untempered mortar of unbounded praise by representing him as all perfect all excellent without the least mixture of alloy was rather a devil incarnate an abandoned monster of mankind of insatiable avarice unbounded ambition implacable malice unparalleled impudence and shocking impiety such is the declamation which lauder in the present day had the audacity to acknowledge as his own composition  we will close this article with bayles review of miltons controversial latin writings for of no others he pretended to judge milton is very expert in the latin language no one can deny that his style is flowing animated and flowery and that he has defended the people adroitly and ingeniously but without entering too deeply into this subject it must be confessed that his manner is exceptionable it is not sufficiently serious for the importance of his subject we see him at every moment  i do not say pouring forth sharp railleries against mr salmasius that would not injure his work but gain the laughers on his side  attempting to be farcical and to play off the buffoon this censure particularly extends to his two answers of mr morus they are replete with outrageous jests the character of the author here appears without a mask he is one of those satiric geniuses who indeed are too fond of collecting all the disadvantageous reports of others and of having written by the enemies of another all the calumnies they know but who feel a greater gratification to insert those calumnies in the first libel they publish against any one  i hope this heavy charge laid to our great poet is not just he felt great provocations from salmasius and morus and he was deeply concerned in one of the greatest political revolutions surely the sublime conceptions of milton could not descend to collect the tattle of scandal to do this one must have a mind as little and a heart as rancorous as some of our modern versificators  arabic proverbs there are persons who set out vigorously but soon flag and go back like a star which promises rain and immediately leaves the sky clear this poetical thought schultens interprets of such as make large promises and even design to execute them but fall short for want of constancy and resolution  every one living is cut down by death happy the man who is mowed down green this beautiful sentiment requires no illustration  why are you displeased at the words of one who advises with sincerity since such a person mends your torn clothes here it is observed that mending what is torn is applied in a figurative sense to the ill condition of the mind  the cure of a proud man is performed by driving out his buzzing fly and taking satan out of his nostrils here schultens remarks that the noisy boastings of the haughty man are beautifully represented by the troublesome and insignificant buzzing of a large fly  the dam of the roaring beast is not very prolific but the dam of the barking beast produces many whelps by the roaring beast is here meant the lion by the barking beast the dog the sense of the proverb is  that persons of great and elevated accomplishments are but few those of a contrary character very numerous  curiosities of literature historical anecdotes trials and proofs of guilt in superstitious ages it is a melancholy contemplation to reflect on the strange trials to which in the remoter ages those suspected of guilt were put the ordeal consisted of various kinds walking blindfold amidst heated ploughshares passing through two fires holding in the hand a redhot bar and plunging the hand into boiling water challenging the accuser to single combat when frequently the stoutest champion was allowed to supply their place the swallowing a morsel of consecrated bread the sinking or swimming in a river for witchcraft and various others though sometimes these might be eluded by the artifice of the priest what numbers of innocent victims have been sacrificed to such barbarous superstitions  in the twelfth century they were very common hildebert bishop of mans being accused of high treason by our william rufus was preparing to undergo one of these trials when ives bishop of chartres convinced him that they were against the canons of the constitutions of the church  an abbot of saint aubin of angers who lived in  0   having refused to present a horse to the viscount of touars which the viscount claimed in right of his lordship whenever an abbot first took possession of the said abbey the ecclesiastic offered to justify himself by the trial of the ordeal or by duel for which he proposed to furnish a man the viscount at first agreed to the duel but reflecting that these combats though sanctioned by the church depended wholly on the skill or vigor of the adversary and could therefore afford no substantial proof of the equity of his claim he proposed to compromise the matter in a manner which strongly characterizes the times he waved his claim on condition that the abbot should not forget to mention in his prayers himself his wife and his brothers as the orisons appeared to the abbot in comparison with the horse of little or no value he accepted the proposal  pope eugene approved of and even introduced the trial by immersion in cold water  it was about that time also that those who were accused of robbery were put to trial by a piece of barley bread on which the mass had been said and if they could not swallow it they were declared guilty this mode of trial was improved by adding to the bread a slice of cheese and such were the credulity and firm dependence on heaven in these ridiculous trials that they were very particular in the composition of this holy bread and cheese the bread was to be of unleavened barley and the cheese made of ewes milk of the month of may no other of the twelve months having any power to detect a criminal  du cange has observed that the expression we long have employed   may this piece of bread choke me comes from this custom  the anecdote of earl godwins death by swallowing a piece of bread in making this asseveration is recorded in our history if it be true it was a singular misfortune  voltaire says that they were acquainted in those times with secrets to pass unhurt these singular trials he particularly mentions one for undergoing that of boiling water these are his words  the whole secret is said to consist in rubbing ones self a long time with the spirit of vitriol and alum together with the juice of an onion none of the academies of science in our days have attempted to verify by experiments a truth well known to quacks and mountebanks  but amongst these trials not the least ridiculous was that of the bleeding of a corpse if a person was murdered it was said that at the touch or at the approach of the murderer the blood gushed out of the body in various parts this was once allowed in england and is still looked on in some of the uncivilized parts of these kingdoms as a detection of the criminal it forms a rich picture to the imagination of our old writers and their narrations and ballads are labored into pathos by dwelling on this phenomenon yet what is this evidence in the eyes of the enlightened philosopher it does not always happen in the presence of the murderer it bleeds suddenly in that of the innocent and is it not natural to suppose that when a body is full of blood warmed by a sudden external heat having been considerably stirred or moved and a putrefaction coming on some of the blood vessels should burst as it is certain they all will in time  for this last ingenious remark i am indebted to the encyclopedia britannica  singularities observed by various nations in their repasts i have collected from a very curious book entitled   lesprit des usages et des coutumes the greater part of the present article  the maldivian islanders eat alone they retire into the most hidden parts of their houses and they draw down the cloths that serve as blinds to their windows that they may eat unobserved this custom probably arises  remarks our philosophic author  from the savage in the early periods of society concealing himself to eat he fears that another with as sharp an appetite but more strong than himself should come and ravish his meal from him besides the ideas of witchcraft are widely spread among barbarians and they are not a little fearful that some incantation may be thrown amongst their victuals  in noticing the solitary meal of the maldivian islander another reason may be alleged for this misanthropical repast they never will eat with any one who is inferior to them in birth in riches or dignity and as it is a difficult matter to settle this equality they are condemned to lead this unsociable life  on the contrary the islanders of the philippines are remarkably sociable whenever one of them finds himself without a companion to partake of his meal he runs till he meets with one and we are assured that however keen his appetite may be he ventures not to satisfy it without a guest  savages says montaigne when they eat  sessuyent les doigts oux cuisses a la bourse des genitoires et a la plant des pieds it is impossible to translate this passage without offending feminine delicacy nor can we forbear exulting in the polished convenience of napkins  the tables of the rich chinese shine with a beautiful varnish and are covered with silk carpets very elegantly worked they do not make use of plates knives or forks every guest has two little ivory or ebony sticks which he handles very adroitly  the otaheiteans who are lovers of society and very gentle in their manners feed separate from each other at the hour of repast the members of each family divide two brothers two sisters and even husband and wife father and mother have each their respective basket they place themselves at the distance of two or three yards from each other they turn their backs and take their meal in profound silence  the custom of drinking at different hours from those assigned for eating is to be met with amongst many savage nations it was originally begun from necessity it became an habit which subsisted even when the fountain was near to them a people transplanted observes our ingenious philosopher preserve in another climate modes of living which relate to those from whence they originally came it is thus the indians of brazil scrupulously abstain from eating when they drink and from drinking when they eat  when neither decency or politeness are known the man who invites his friends to a repast is greatly embarrassed to testify his esteem for his guests and to present them with some amusement for the savage guest imposes on him this obligation amongst the greater part of the american indians the host is continually on the watch to solicit them to eat but touches nothing himself in new france he wearies himself with singing to divert the company while they eat  when civilization advances we wish to show our confidence to our friends we treat them as relations and it is said that in china the master of the house to give a mark of his politeness absents himself while his guests regale themselves at his table in undisturbed revelry  the demonstrations of friendship in a rude state have a savage and gross character which it is not a little curious to observe the tartars pull a man by the ear to press him to drink and they continue tormenting him till he opens his mouth it is then they clap their hands and dance before him  no customs seem more ridiculous than those practiced by a kamtschadale when he wishes to make another his friend he first invites him to eat the host and his guest strip themselves in a cabin which is heated to an uncommon degree while the guest devours the food with which they serve him the other continually stirs the fire the stranger must bear the excess of the heat as well as of the repast he vomits ten times before he will yield but at length obliged to acknowledge himself overcome he begins to compound matters he purchases a moments respite by a present of clothes or dogs for his host threatens to heat the cabin and to oblige him to eat till he dies the stranger has the right of retaliation allowed to him he treats in the same manner and exacts the same presents should his host not accept the invitation of his guest whom he has so handsomely regaled he would come and inhabit his cabin till he had obtained from him the presents he had in so singular a manner given to him  for this extravagant custom a curious reason has been alleged it is meant to put the person to a trial whose friendship is sought the kamtschadale who is at the expense of the fires and the repast is desirous to know if the stranger has the strength to support pain with him and if he is generous enough to share with him some part of his property while the guest is employed on his meal he continues heating the cabin to an insupportable degree and for a last proof of the strangers constancy and attachment he exacts more clothes and more dogs the host passes through the same ceremonies in the cabin of the stranger and he shows in his turn with what degree of fortitude he can defend his friend it is thus the most singular customs would appear simple if it were possible for the philosopher to contemplate them on the spot  as a distinguishing mark of their esteem the negroes of ardra drink out of one cup at the same time the king of loango eats in one house and drinks in another a kamtschadale kneels before his guest he cuts an enormous slice from a seacalf he crams it entire into the mouth of his friend furiously crying out   tana  there and cutting away what hangs about his lips snatches and swallows it with avidity  a barbarous magnificence attended the feasts of the ancient monarchs of france we are informed that after their coronation or consecration when they sat at table the nobility served them on horseback  dispensations for marriage gregory the great was the first of the popes who introduced the custom of dispensations for marriage it was occasioned by william the conqueror who having espoused matilda daughter of baldwin the fifth count of flanders who was related to him in a prohibited degree the pope permitted him to live with her on condition of him and matilda each founding an abbey in this business it appears the pope got two abbeys for nothing and he who had conquered all europe could not vanquish the fears of religious prejudice  english ladies it is necessary to premise that the present strictures concerning our country our divines and our lovely countrywomen were written in the days when our great grandmothers were misses  menage says  mr d tells me that in england the public places are crowded with the daughters and the wives of the clergy the reason is that the livings there being very fat ones all the english ladies who are fond of their ease and good living and who are more partial to the present hour than to the future are in raptures to marry a parson who on his side never fails according to the character of a good ecclesiastic of selecting the most beautiful after his death mother and daughters find themselves probably in the greatest distress and as they are in general very handsome they put into practice all their smiles and all their graces and for this reason choose the public resorts of fashion where they may attract notice we catholics should be grateful to the council of trent that prohibited our ecclesiastics from marriage and thus obviated the inconveniences which such marriages produce  spanish monks the monks in spain have introduced a custom which is very useful to them it is that the money to pay the masses which a dying man orders to be said for him must be paid out of the estate he leaves in preference to all his debts the spaniards who seem to have a terrible dread of his satanic majesty order frequently so great a number of masses that too often there remains little or nothing for their unfortunate heirs and creditors on these occasions they say in their humorous way   mr suchanone has left his soul his heir a spanish monarch ordered  00000 masses to be said for him if masses will stand in lieu of so many virtues the worst kings will certainly have the best seats in heaven  monarchs saint chrysostom has a very acute observation on kings there are many monarchs he says who are infected with the strange wish that their successors may turn out bad princes good kings desire it as they imagine  continues this pious politician  that their glory will thus appear the more splendid and the bad desire it as they consider such kings will serve to countenance their own misdemeanors  the virgin mary when melchior inchoffer a jesuit published a book to vindicate a miracle of a letter which the virgin mary had addressed to the citizens of messina naude brought him serious proofs of it is evident forgery inchoffer ingenuously confessed that he knew it was an imposture but that he did it by the orders of his superiors the honest and indignant naude observes  it is thus errors and illusions are spread about the world and thus it is that simple minds are deceived every day there is no danger in the present times of our being cheated by letters from the virgin mary that post office which yielded such considerable revenues to the ecclesiastics has been closed this century past what a revolution has there taken place in the human mind the most enlightened writers about   00 to    0 are either seriously combating or seriously defending miracles patin very cautiously ventures to say that he thinks there are no magicians nor sorcerers he believes however in apparitions and devils  since i have got the virgin mary in my mind i recollect a donation made to her by louis the eleventh nor can i but approve of the manner he employed to present her with this pious gift he made a solemn donation of the whole county of boulogne to the holy virgin  retaining however for his own use the revenues this act bears the date of the year      and it is thus entitled the translation is literal  conveyance of louis the eleventh to the virgin of boulogne of the right and title of the fief and homage of the county of boulogne which is held by the count of saint pol to render a faithful account before the image of the said lady  protestants we have frequently heard the oppressed protestants bitterly complain of the catholic tyranny what i now transcribe from patin will show that there is something to be said on the other side the stubborn bigot is alarmed religious distinctions have been however since his days wearing fast away and as philosophy enlightens the mind the heart insensibly will become more moral though not so religious   all the huguenots  or protestants  of europe will one day agree together and occasion a general revolt under the name of religion particularly whenever they shall have for their chief an enterprizing genius like that of the king of sweden  charles the twelfth i fear those people  he says contemptuously  if they get the upper hand of us will not spare us they will treat us savagely and very differently from what we do them  witness the massacre of st bartholomew and the once long flourishing state of the inquisition  they will not even suffer us to hold our mass as we permit them their service the huguenots are dangerous politicians insolent and unmerciful as they have lately shown us in england  the decapitation of charles the first  and in france during the troubles of the prince de conde in       when patin wrote this it must be recollected that as he turned his eyes on england he had before him the austere and persecuting puritans with cromwell at their head  coffee it is curious to observe the description purchase  of whom an account has been given in the first part of this work  gives us of coffee when yet it had not been introduced into europe he writes that the turks have coffahouses more common than alehouses with us in or near to which on benches in the street they will sit chatting most of the day drinking their coffa  so called of a berry it is made of  as hot as they can endure it it is black as soot and tastes not much unlike it good they say for digestion and mirth the second edition of this book was published in      coffee was introduced into england by mr edwards a turkish merchant in the year       inquisition innocent the third a pope as enterprizing as he was successful in his enterprises having sent dominic with some missionaries into languedoc these men so irritated the heretics they were sent to convert that most of them were assassinated at toulouse in the year   00 it was then he called in for aid temporal arms and published against them a crusade granting as is usual with the popes on similar occasions all kinds of indulgences and pardons to those who should arm against these mahometans as he styled these unfortunate men raimond count of toulouse was constrained to submit the inhabitants were passed on the edge of the sword without distinction of age or sex it was then he established that scourge of europe the inquisition for having considered that though all might be compelled to submit by arms there might remain numbers who would profess particular dogmas he established this sanguinary tribunal solely to inspect into all families and examine all persons who they imagined were unfriendly to the interests of rome dominic did so much by his cares and continued persecutions that he firmly established it at toulouse  it was as late as the year      that it became known in spain it was also to a dominican john de torquemada that the court of rome owed this obligation as he was the confessor of queen isabella he had extorted from her a promise that if ever she ascended the throne she would use every means to extirpate heresy and heretics ferdinand had conquered grenada and had chaced from the spanish realms multitudes of unfortunate moors a few had remained who with the jews he obliged to become christians they at least assumed the name but it was well known that both these nations naturally respected their own prejudices rather than those of the christians  torquemada pretended that this dissimulation would greatly hurt the interests of the holy religion the queen listened with respectful diffidence to her confessor and at length gained over the king to consent to the establishment of this barbarous tribunal torquemada indefatigable in his zeal for the holy seat in the space of fourteen years that he exercised the office of chief inquisitor persecuted one hundred thousand persons of whom six thousand were condemned to the flames  let us contemplate a slight sketch of that despotism which with the destruction of the bastile we hope is extinguished throughout europe  during the pontificate of sixtus the fifth the inquisition was powerful and rigorous in rome muretus in writing to de thou the historian says  we do not know what becomes of the people here almost every day when i rise i hear with an alarming surprise how such an one has disappeared we dare not whisper our suspicions the inquisition would be immediately at our doors  the illustrious the title of illustrious was never given till the reign of constantine but to those whose reputation was splendid in arms or in letters flattery had not yet adopted this noble word into her vocabulary suetonius has composed a book to mention those who had possessed this title and as it was then bestowed a moderate book was sufficient to contain their names  in the time of constantine the title of illustrious was given more particularly to those princes who had distinguished themselves in war but it was not continued to their descendants at length it became very common and every son of a prince was illustrious it is now a word of little signification it is however very serviceable to the poet who employs it frequently as a convenient epithet to complete the measure of his verse  cromwell in the funeral oration of henrietta queen of england the character of cromwell is delineated by a pencil whose strokes are firm though delicate    a man was seen with a profundity of mind that exceeds our belief as finished a hypocrite as he was a skilful politician capable of undertaking any thing and of concealing what he undertook equally indefatigable and active in peace as in war who left nothing to fortune which he could seize from her by foresight and prudence but for what remained always so vigilant and so ready that he never failed to improve the occasions she presented him in a word he was one of those daring and adventurous minds which seem born to change the affairs of the world  the ambassador from the french court in that day was an able minister and that he was at the same time a fine writer the following sketch of cromwell evinces it has the advantage of being given by one who was a witness to what he observes    he was gentle and cruel when either was necessary for his interests he had no faith in religion no honor in his professions no fidelity to his friends than as the semblance of these virtues served toward his aggrandizement he knew better than any man to put into practice all the pious grimaces and insinuating manners of the false votarists of religion and to conceal under an humble air and popular address an unmeasurable ambition in a word he possessed in the supreme degree all the qualities of a great politician and there was nothing wanting to complete his good fortune but to have acquired his success by better means to have lived longer and to have had children worthy of succeeding him  joan of arc of the maid of orleans i have somewhere read that a bundle of faggots was made to supply her place when she was supposed to have been burnt by the duke of bedford none of our historians notice this anecdote though some have mentioned that after her death an impostor arose and was even married to a french gentleman by whom she had several children whether she deserved to have been distinguished by the appellation of the maid of orleans we have great reason to suspect and some in her days by her fondness for mans apparel even doubted her sex the following epitaph on her i find in a volume entitled historical rarities and which possessing some humor merits to be rescued from total oblivion   here lies joan of arc the which some count saint and some count witch some count man and something more some count maid and some a whore her lifes in question wrong or right her deaths in doubt by laws or might oh innocence take heed of it how thou too near to guilt do sit meantime france a wonder saw  a woman rule against salique law but reader be content to stay thy censure till the judgment day then shall thou know and not before whether saint witch man maid or whore transubstantiation in his account of the mexicans abbe raynal says  they had a piece of superstition of which no traces can be found in any other country on certain days the priests made a statue of paste which they sent to the oven to be baked they then placed it on an altar where it became a divinity innumerable crowds flocked to the temple the priest cut the statue in pieces and distributed a portion of it to all the persons in the assembly who ate it and thought they were sanctified by swallowing their god  did the abbe forget the rites of his own religion when he observes  no traces of this superstition can be found in any other country is not all this but a simple description of the nonsense of transubstantiation the recital of history frequently when applied to our own times forms the severest satire  america  it is computed by able writers says my lord kaimes that the present inhabitants of america amount not to a twentieth part of those who existed when that continent was discovered by columbus this decay is ascribed to the intemperate use of spirits and to the smallpox both of them introduced by the europeans he seems to have forgotten that they are indebted to us also for the intemperate use of the sword and the dreadful bigotry and cruelties practiced by the religious and avaricious spaniards which certainly are not less destructive than the contagion of the smallpox or the poison of spirituous liquors  we may also add another proof of european humanity a plantation in jamaica which employs a hundred slaves requires an annual recruit of no fewer than seven who fall the yearly victims to the cruelties of the lower overseers who follow them all day with whips  bartholomew casa affirms that the spaniards in america destroyed in about fortyfive years ten millions of human souls and this with a view of converting these unfortunate men to christianity there is a story recorded of an indian who being tied to the stake a franciscan friar persuaded him to turn christian and then he would go to heaven the indian asked him whether there were any spaniards in heaven  certainly the friar answered it is full of them  then the last words of the dying indian were i had rather go to hell than have any more of their company  enchanted tapestry about the year      the portuguese attempted to settle at borneo too feeble to make their arms respected they tried to gain the good will of one of the sovereigns of the country by offering him some tapestry this weak prince took the figures wrought on it for enchanted men who would strangle him in the nightime if he suffered them to approach his person the explanations they gave to remove his apprehensions had no effect he obstinately refused to permit the present to be brought into his palace and at the same time prohibited the donors from entering his capital had his majesty been acquainted with the aeneid of virgil he might have exclaimed what for the benefit of the ladies we shall give in drydens version  somewhat is sure designed by fraud or force trust not their presents nor admit the horse   fashions the origin of many probably of most fashions was in the endeavor to conceal some deformity of the inventor thus charles the seventh of france introduced long coats to hide his illmade legs shoes with very long points full two feet in length were invented by henry plantaganet duke of anjou to conceal a very large excrescence which he had upon one of his feet  sometimes fashions are quite reversed in one age from those of another thus bags when first in fashion in france were only wore en dishabille in visits of ceremony the hair was tied in a ribband and floated over the shoulders  all which is exactly contrary to our present fashion queen isabella of bavaria as remarkable for her gallantry as the fairness of her complexion introduced a fashion of leaving the shoulders and part of the neck uncovered  in england about the reign of henry the fourth they wore longpointed shoes to such an immoderate length that they could not walk till they were fastened to their knees with chains luxury improving on this ridiculous mode it was the custom of an english beau of the fourteenth century to have these chains of gold or silver a very accurate account of one of this description may be found in henrys history of great britain in his chapter on manners etc vol iv the ladies of that period were not less fantastical in their dress and it must be confessed that the most cynical fatirist can have no reason on a comparison with those times to censure our present modes  to this article as it may probably arrest the volatile eye of our fair reader we add what may serve as a hint for the heightening of her charms tacitus remarks of poppea the queen of nero that she concealed a part of her face to the end he adds that the imagination having fuller play by irritating curiosity they might think higher of her beauty than if the whole of her face had been exposed  the great and little turk titles frequently remain when the occasions of making them are forgotten perhaps few know why the ottoman emperor is called the great turk it is not as some have imagined to distinguish him from his own subjects this was the occasion mahomet the second was the first of these emperors on whom the christians bestowed the title of the great turk it was not owing to his great actions that this splendid title was accorded to him but to the vast extent of his dominions in comparison with those of the sultan of iconia or cappadocia his contemporary who was distinguished by the title of the little turk after the taking of constantinople mahomet the second deprived the latter of his domains and still preserved the title of the great turk though the propriety of it by this accident was lost  the pouliats and the pouliches the present article which i have drawn from abbe raynal presents two pictures of the debasement of the human race which perhaps history has never paralleled   there is a tribe amongst the indians which is the refuse of the rest the members of it are employed in the meanest offices of society they bury the dead carry away dirt and live upon the flesh of animals that die natural deaths they are prohibited from entering into the temples and public markets neither are they allowed the use of the wells that are common to all their inhabitants their dwellings are at the extremity of the towns or consist of solitary cottages in the country and they are even forbidden to appear in the streets where the bramins reside as all other indians they may employ themselves in the labors of agriculture but only for the benefit of the other tribes for they are not permitted to have lands of their own not even upon lease such is the degree of horror they excite that if by chance they were to touch any one not belonging to their tribe they would be deprived with impunity of a life reckoned too abject to deserve the protection of the laws most of them are employed in the culture of rice near the fields where they carry on this work there is a kind of hut into which they retire when they hear a cry which always comes from a distance to give them notice of some order from the person on whom they depend to which they answer not coming out of their retreat they take the same precautions whenever they are warned by a confused kind of noise of the approach of any man whatever if they have not time to hide themselves they fall prostrate on the ground with their faces downwards with all the marks of humiliation which the sense of their disgrace can suggest   whenever the harvests do not answer to the avidity of an oppressive master he sometimes cruelly sets fire to the huts of these unhappy laborers and if they attempt to escape the flames he fires upon them without mercy the condition of these wretched people is horrible in every respect even in the manner in which they are forced to provide for their most urgent wants in the dusk of the evening they come out from their retreats in bands they direct their steps toward the market at a certain distance from which they begin to bellow the merchants approach and they ask for what they want they are supplied and the provisions are laid on the very spot where the money destined for the payment of them has been previously deposited when the purchasers can be assured that they shall not be seen by any one they come out from behind the hedge where they had concealed themselves and carry away with precipitation what they have acquired in so singular a manner  after contemplating this dishonorable picture of man a degeneracy in human nature which probably the reader could hardly suspect he may deepen the philosophic reverie by what the abbe gives us in continuation   yet this very tribe of pouliats have an inferior one among themselves called pouliches these last are forbidden the use of fire they are not permitted to build huts but are reduced to the necessity of living in a kind of nest upon the trees or in the forests when pressed with hunger they howl like wild beasts to excite compassion the most charitable then deposit some rice or other food at the foot of a tree and retire with all possible haste to give the famished wretch an opportunity of taking it without meeting with his benefactor who would think himself polluted by coming near him  to clear up this curious information which stretches to the utmost the belief of the reader the abbe presents us with an excellent philosophical argument this extreme disgrace he says into which a considerable part of a numerous nation is plunged has always appeared an inexplicable circumstance men of the utmost sagacity have never been able to conceive how a people humane and sensible could have brought themselves to reduce their own brethren to so abject a state to solve this difficulty let us be permitted to hazard a conjecture in our half barbarous governments dreadful torments or an ignominious death are allotted to those criminals who have disturbed in a greater or less degree the peace of society may we not therefore reasonably suppose that in the soft climate of india a more moderate system of legislature may have been satisfied with excluding from their tribes all kinds of malefactors this punishment must appear to them sufficient to put a stop to the commissions of such crimes and it was certainly the best adapted to a country where the effusion of blood was always forbidden by religious as well as moral principles it would certainly have been a very proper circumstance if the children had not inherited the infamy of their parents but there were unfurmountable prejudices which militated against this reinstatement a family never being received again into a tribe after it had been once expelled from it  the solution of the abbe is ingenious and probable but the mosaic threat of vengeance extending to the third and fourth generation is uncongenial to the mild spirit of humane philosophy yet is this threat on record in those commandments which are said to have been written by the finger of god himself surely this cannot accord with the unwearied benevolence of a paternal deity let us rather acknowledge with a sigh that there are multitudes of the human race who really believe themselves to be the property of a small number of men who oppress them the image of the creator is so debased in some parts of the globe that it may be said the hand of the oppressor has effaced every mark of it is original greatness  the thirteen cantons who can contemplate without enthusiasm the exertions of men when they have been prompted to rely on their own force to act up to that sublime character they hold in the scale of creation and to write with their own blood the charter of their liberty we have just come from meditating on nations who beneath the enervating skies of india destitute of the delights of liberty have sunk to a degree even beneath their associates who graze the field and lap the waters of the brook let us now turn our eyes to the bleak heaven and the snowy mountains of switzerland where the hardy native roams free and unconstrained and knows himself a man  the pride the insolence and the tyranny of those governors who were given to the helvetians in the name of the empire by the dukes of austria awakened at once the minds of this people who regarded freedom as their birthright yet whom the governors attempted to oppress as slaves three peasants resolved to preserve their liberties and each of them collected his friends in his own burgh in the year   0  switz uri and underwal declared themselves independent and as the party of switz was the earliest in promoting this alliance they had the honor of giving to this confederate nation the name of swiss and to the country that of switzerland the other cantons joined them at different periods appenzel the last of the thirteen cantons closed this honorable confederacy in       charles the first a french writer has recorded an anecdote of this unfortunate prince which characterizes the classical turn of his mind and the placability of his disposition   a frenchman who had formed a tender connection with the wife of one of the principal enemies of charles  who was then put under arrest but very carelessly guarded  having learnt from this lady that they had resolved to make the king perish on a scaffold communicated the intelligence to mr de bellicore the french ambassador who immediately ran to the king to give him the important notice bellicore was kept in waiting for a long time at last the king came to him and said  i have been at a comedy and i never was more entertained  ah sire answered bellicore it is about a tragedy of which i have to speak to you and then informed him of what had been lately communicated to him entreating him at the same time to save himself by a vessel which he could instantly prepare the king calmly answered him with this fine line from ovid  qui procumbit humi non habet unde cadat  he who lies prostrate on the earth need not fear to fall  sire said bellicore they may occasion his head to fall  this shows that he did not suspect their cruelties would ever have been carried to the length they were and it must be confessed when he had been brought so low all the rest was persecuting inhumanity  king of england france etc nothing can be more empty and ridiculous than the title which our monarchs assume of  the king of france it would characterize a great prince to eraze from his true honors this fictitious one an english monarch should not suffer his dignity to be exposed to the smile of the philosopher  charpentier very temperately states the only two principles by which our kings can assume this title the first from edward the third being son of isabella of france who was sister to three kings of france  louis hutin philip the long and charles the fair who died without children so that edward their nephew disputed the crown of france with philip de valois on the foundation of the salique law which had never yet been agitated this law says that the kingdom of france ne tombant point en quenouille i e the scepter of france shall never degenerate into a distaff the children of the daughters of france can never succeed to it as the present monarchs of england are not descendants of this edward they cannot have any pretensions to the crown of france if it had not been a maxim with them that the rights once devolved on the crown are for ever unalienable and imprescriptible the second principle is the donation which charles the sixth made of the crown of france to our henry the fifth his soninlaw to the exclusion of his son charles the seventh  we may add here that cromwell offered to sell cardinal mazarine all the vouchers for france which are preserved in the tower for a hundred thousand crowns it was at this price he rated the claims of england to the crown of france but the cardinal wisely deemed even that sum too high a price  if it be a maxim with our crown of which i am ignorant that the rights once devolved upon it are unalienable and imprescriptible it may be said that we possess the united states of america but i believe this sovereignty would not be so easily permitted as that of the french monarchy  william the conqueror that it is dangerous to exercise our raillery on those men whose swords are sharper than their pens the present anecdote may verify  philip the first of france frequently indulged his humor at the expense of the conquerors rather too large embonpoint and prominent belly when william remained uncommonly long at rouen philip who did not much approve of his proximity to his court frequently in a jesting manner enquired of his courtiers if they did not know when william would liein the conqueror informed of this jest gave him to understand that when he should get abroad he would come to return his compliments for his kind enquiries to saint genevieve at paris with ten thousand lances instead of candles whatever might be the wit of these monarchs the arms of william were not contemptible such was the vengeance he took for the raillery of philip that he desolated in a short time the french vexin burnt the city of mantes and massacred the inhabitants and had not his death impeded his progress he very probably would have conquered france as he had england  charles the fifth charles the fifth used to say the portuguese appeared to be madmen and were so the spaniards appeared to be wise and were not the italians appeared to be wise and were so the french appeared to be madmen and were not  that the germans spoke like carmen the english like simpletons the french like masters and the spaniards like kings  this emperor  who though he thus censures our english modesty is indebted to our country for his bestwritten life  was called by the sicilians scipio africanus by the italians david by the french hercules by the turks julius caesar by the africans hannibal by the germans charlemagne and by the spaniards alexander the great these are the titles of adulation one is almost tempted to call him by a grosser name when one reflects on his folly in quitting a crown which had long been the idol of his ambition to sink into a solitary retreat with a pension that was never paid to him and having no more the power of disturbing the tranquillity of europe to tyrannize over a few melancholy monks and as fenelon expresses it every day to become ennuye with having nothing to do but praying to god winding his watch and continually scolding the poor unhappy novices whose great curse it was to be associated with him who had been the most potent monarch on earth  the goths and huns the barbarous honors which these ferocious nations paid to their deceased monarchs are recorded in history by the interment of attila king of the huns and alaric king of the goths  attila died in     and was buried in the midst of a vast champaign in a coffin which was enclosed in one of gold another of silver and the third of iron with the body were interred all the spoils of the enemy  harnesses embroidered with gold and studded with jewels rich silks and whatever they had taken most precious in the palaces of the kings they had pillaged and that the place of his interment might for ever remain concealed the huns deprived of life all who had assisted at his burial  the goths had done nearly the same for alaric in   0 at cosence a town in calabria they turned aside the river vasento and having formed a grave in the midst of it is bed where it is course was most rapid they interred this king with prodigious accumulations of riches after having caused the river to reassume it is usual course they murdered without exception all those who had been concerned in digging this singular grave  philip the third philip the third king of spain was a weak prince who suffered himself to be governed by his ministers a patriot wished to open his eyes but he could not pierce through the crowds of his flatterers besides that the voice of patriotism heard in a corrupted court would have become a crime never to have been pardoned he found however an ingenious manner of conveying to him his censure he caused to be laid on his table one day a letter sealed which bore this address  to the king of spain philip the third at present in the service of the duke of lerma  in a similar manner don carlos son to philip the second made a book with empty pages to contain the voyages of his father which bore this title  the great and admirable voyages of the king mr philip all these voyages consisted of going to the escurial from madrid and returning to madrid from the escurial jests of this kind at length cost him his life  dethroned monarchs fortune never appears in a more extravagant humor than when she reduces monarchs to become mendicants this is no uncommon revolution in her eventful volumes modern history has recorded many such instances  in candide or the optimist the reader will find an admirable stroke of voltaires eight travelers meet in an obscure inn and some of them with not sufficient money to pay for a scurvy dinner in the course of conversation they are discovered to be eight monarchs in europe who had been deprived of their crowns  what adds to this exquisite satire is that the eight monarchs are not of the fictitious majestys of the poetic brain imperial shadows like those that appeared to macbeth but living monarchs who were wandering at that moment about the world  theodore king of corsica is not yet forgotten by many smollet in his ferdinand count fathom has given us some curious anecdotes which paint very forcibly the singular distresses of that monarch  here is another to be added to this list in the year      died at paris antonio king of portugal his body is interred at the cordeliers and his heart deposited at the ave maria nothing on earth was capable of obliging this prince to renounce his crown he passed over to england and came to france where he resided and died in great poverty at the age of sixtyfour years this dethroned monarch was happy in one thing which is indeed rare in all his miseries he had a servant who proved a tender and faithful friend and who only desired to participate in his misfortunes and to soften his miseries and for the recompense of his services he only wished to be buried at the feet of his dear master this hero in loyalty to whom the ancient romans had raised altars was don diego bothei one of the greatest lords of the court of portugal and who drew his origin from the kings of bohemia  royal divinities we know that the first roman emperors did not want flatterers and that the adulations they sometimes lavished were extravagant but perhaps few know they were less offensive than the flatterers of the third age under the pagan and of the fourth under the christian emperors those who are acquainted with the character of the age of augustus have only to throw their eyes on the one and the other code to find an infinite number of passages which had not been bearable in that age for instance here is a law of arcadius and honorius published in  0    let the officers of the palace be warned to abstain from frequenting tumultuous meetings and that those who instigated by a sacrilegious temerity dare to oppose the authority of our divinity shall be deprived of their employments and their estates confiscated the letters they write are holy when the sons speak of their fathers it is  their father of divine memory or  their divine father they call their own laws oracles and celestial oracles so also their subjects address them by the titles of   your perpetuity  your eternity and it appears by a law of theodore the great that the emperors at length added this to their titles it begins thus  if any magistrate after having concluded a public work puts his name rather than that of our perpetuity let him be judged guilty of high treason  historian the famous le clerc great in his day as a journalist observes that there are four principal things essential to constitute a good historian and without which nothing considerable from him can be expected the first is to be well instructed in what he undertakes to relate the second to be able without any disguises to say what he thinks to be the truth the third is to be capable of realating what he knows the fourth to be capable of judging of the events and of those who occasion them if we reflect on the ability of the historian in these four points we may be enabled to judge if a history is well or ill written  queen elizabeth vigneul marville has written in his lively and bold manner what i must confess i think just concerning our virginqueen as the voice of adulation has distinguished her   elizabeth queen of england passionately admired handsome and wellmade men and he was already far advanced in her favor who approached her with beauty and with grace on the contrary she had so unconquerable an aversion for ugly and illmade men who had been treated unfortunately by nature that she could not endure their presence   when she issued from her palace her guards were careful to disperse from before her eyes hideous and deformed people the lame the hunchbacked etc in a word all those whose appearance might shock her delicate sensations   there is this singular and admirable in the conduct of elizabeth that she made her pleasures subservient to her politics and she maintained her affairs by what in general occasions the ruin of princes so secret were her amors that even to the present day their mysteries cannot be penetrated but the utility she drew from them is public and always operated for the good of her people her lovers were her ministers and her ministers were her lovers love commanded love was obeyed and the reign of this princess was happy because it was a reign of love in which it is chains and it is slavery are liked  the origin of raleighs advancement in the queens graces was by an action of gallantry which perfectly gratified her majesty not insensible to flattery he found the queen taking a walk and a wet place incommoding her royal footsteps raleigh immediately spread his new plush cloak across the miry place the queen stepped cautiously on it and passed over dry but not without a particular observation of him who had given her so eloquent though silent a flattery shortly afterward from captain raleigh he became sir walter and rapidly advanced in the queens favor  parr and jenkins of these men who are singular instances of a patriarchal longevity of life the reader will not be displeased to attend to the following well authenticated notices concerning them  thomas parr was born in the last year of king edward the fourth anno      he married his first wife jane at eighty years of age and in above thirty years she brought him but two children the eldest of which did not live above three years he married his second wife catherine when he was an hundred and twenty years of age by whom he had one child he lived till he had attained to something above one hundred and fifty years of age thomas earl of arundel caused him to be brought to westminster about two months before his death there he passed most of his time in sleep and an ocular witness has thus described him  from head to heel his body had all over a quickset thickset natural hairy cover   it is supposed this removal by taking him from his native air and the disturbance of much company hastened his death he died there november         in the ninth year of king charles the first and was buried in the abbey  henry jenkins lived till he was an hundred and sixtynine years of age a remarkable circumstance discovered the age of this man being sworn a witness in a cause of an hundred and twenty years the judge could not help reproving him till he said he was then butler to the lord conyers and at length his name was found in some old register of the lord conyerss menial servants dr tancred robinson who sent the account of this man to the royal society adds farther that henry jenkins coming into his sisters kitchen to beg an alms he asked him how old he was after a little pausing he said he was about one hundred and sixtytwo or three the doctor asked him what kings he remembered he said henry the eighth what public things he could longest remember he said the fight at flowden field whether the king was there he said no he was in france and the earl of surrey was general how old he was then he said about twelve years old the doctor inspected an old chronicle that was in the house and found that the battle of flowden field was one hundred and fiftytwo years before that the earl he named was general and that henry the eighth was then at tournay  jenkins was a poor man and could neither write nor read he died december the  th    0  feudal tyranny the feudal government introduced a species of servitude which till that time was unknown and which was called the servitude of the land the bondmen or villains did not reside in the house of the lord but they entirely depended on his caprice and he sold them as he did the animals with the field where they lived and which they cultivated  it is difficult to conceive with what insolence the petty lords of those times tyrannized over their villains they not only oppressed their slaves with unremitted labor instigated by a vile cupidity but their whim and caprice led them to inflict miseries without even any motive of interest  in scotland they had a right to enjoy the first fruits of all the maidens and malcolm the third did not abolish this shameful right but by ordering that they might be redeemed by a quitrent  others to preserve this privilege when they could not enjoy it in all it is extent thrust their leg booted into the bed of the newmarried couple others have compelled their subjects to pass the first night at the top of a tree and there to consummate the marriage to pass the bridal hours in a river to be bound naked to a cart and to trace some furrows as they were dragged or to leap with their feet tied over the horns of stags  sometimes their caprice commanded the bridegroom to appear in drawers at their castle and plunge into a ditch of mud and sometimes they were compelled to beat the waters of the ponds to hinder the frogs from disturbing the lord  there was a time when the german lords reckoned amongst their privileges that of robbing on the highways of their territory  i beg leave to remind the reader of the shameful behavior of geoffrey lord of coventry who compelled his wife to ride naked on a white pad through the streets of the town that by this mode he might restore to the inhabitants those privileges of which his wantonness had deprived them  when the abbot of figeac makes his entry into that town the lord of montbrun dressed in a harlequins coat and one of his legs naked is compelled by an ancient custom to conduct him to the door of his abbey by leading his horse by the bridle  the feudal barons frequently associated to share amongst them those children of their villains who appeared to be the most healthy and serviceable or who were remarkable for their talents and not infrequently sold them in their markets as they did their beasts  the feudal servitude is not even in the present enlightened times entirely abolished in poland in germany and in russia in those countries the bondmen are still entirely dependent on the caprice of their masters the peasants of hungary or bohemia frequently revolt and attempt to shake off the pressure of feudal tyranny and it is ardently to be wished that their wretched servitude should in some measure be softened  it is scarce thirty years past when a lord or prince of the northern countries passing through one of his villages observed a little assembly of peasants and their families amusing themselves with dancing he commands his domestics to part the men from the women and confine them in the houses he orders that the coats of the women may be drawn up above their heads and tied with their garters he then permits the men to be liberated and inflicts a severe castigation on all those who did not recognize their wives in that state  absolute dominion hardens the human heart and nobles accustomed to command their bondmen will treat their domestics as slaves those of siberia punish theirs by an abundant use of the cudgel or rod the abbe chappe saw two russian slaves undress a chambermaid who had by some trifling negligence given offense to her mistress after having uncovered as far as her waist one placed her head betwixt his knees the other held her by the feet while both armed with two sharp rods violently lashed her back till it pleased the tyrant of the house to decree it was enough  after a perusal of these anecdotes of feudal tyranny i shall take leave to transcribe the following lines from goldsmith  calm is my soul nor apt to rise in arms except when fastapproaching danger warms but when contending chiefs blockade the throne contracting regal power to stretch their own when i behold a factious band agree to call it freedom when themselves are free fear pity justice indignation start tear off reserve and bare my swelling heart till half a patriot half a coward grown i fly from petty tyrants  to the throne   gaming gaming appears to be an universal passion some have attempted to deny it is universality they have imagined that it is chiefly prevalent in cold climates where such a passion becomes most capable of agitating and gratifying the torpid minds of their inhabitants  but if we lay aside speculation and turn to facts we are surely warranted in the supposition that as the love of gaming proceeds from a varice  that dishonorable passion which probably for some wise purposes is so congenial to the human heart  it is not unjust to conclude that it exists with equal force in human nature and consequently the fatal propensity of gaming is to be discovered as well amongst the inhabitants of the frigid and torrid zones as amongst those of the milder climates the savage and the civilized the illiterate and the learned are alike captivated with the hope of accumulating wealth without the labors of industry  mr moore has lately given to the public an elaborate work which professedly treats of the three most important topics which a writer of the present day can discuss  suicide gaming and duelling he has collected a variety of instances of this destructive passion being prevalent in all nations and i shall just notice those which appear most singular  dice and that little pugnacious animal the cock are the chief instruments employed by the numerous nations of the east to agitate their minds and ruin their fortunes to which the chinese  who are desperate gamesters  add the use of cards when all other property is played away the asiatic gambler scruples not to stake his wife or his child on the cast of a die or courage and strength of a martial bird if still unsuccessful the last venture he stakes is himself  in the island of ceylon cockfighting is carried to a great height the sumatrans are addicted to the use of dice a strong spirit of play characterizes a malayan after having resigned every thing to the good fortune of the winner he is reduced to a horrid state of desperation he then loosens a certain lock of hair which indicates war and destruction to all the raving gamester meets he intoxicates himself with opium and working himself up into a fit of phrenzy he bites and kills every one who comes in his way but as soon as ever this lock is seen flowing it is lawful to fire at the person and to destroy him as fast as possible i think it is this which our sailors call to run a muck thus dryden writes  frontless and satireproof he scours the streets and runs an indian muck at all he meets thus also pope  satires my weapon but i am too discreet to run a muck and tilt at all i meet   johnson could not discover the derivation of the word muck i think i have heard that it refers to their employing on these fatal occasions a muck or lance but my recollection is probably imperfect  to discharge their gambling debts the siamese sell their possessions their families and at length themselves the chinese play night and day till they have lost all they are worth and then they usually go and hang themselves such is the propensity of the japanese for high play that they were compelled to make a law that whoever ventures his money at play shall be put to death in the newlydiscovered islands of the pacific ocean they venture even their hatchets which they hold as invaluable acquisitions on running matches we saw a man as cook writes in his last voyage beating his breast and tearing his hair in the violence of rage for having lost three hatchets at one of these races and which he had purchased with nearly half his property  the ancient nations were not less addicted to gaming in the same volume are collected numerous instances amongst the ancient persians grecians and romans the goths the germans etc to notice the modern ones were a melancholy task there is hardly a family in europe who cannot record from their own domestic annals the dreadful prevalence of this unfortunate passion affection has felt the keenest lacerations and genius been irrecoverably lost by a wanton sport which doomed to destruction the hopes of families and consumed the heart of the gamester with corrosive agony  the athenians marville has given this pleasing account of the athenians    the greeks were so polished a nation that they treated others as rude and barbarous but of all the greeks the athenians possessed a more refined delicacy in the politer arts and an exquisite taste for eloquence the excellent orators who arose amongst them had familiarized them with the most perfect beauties of composition   pericles whose eloquence they compared to lightnings and thunders had so accustomed their minds to suffer nothing but what was pure elegant and finished that those who had to speak in public looked upon the lowest of the people as so many censurers of what they were going to say but if the genius of this people had become so delicate by the attic eloquence of their orators the native haughtiness of the greeks was much increased by their servile adulation so that it required a wonderful dexterity to stretch the empire of persuasion over men who always would be treated like masters   the establishment of the singular law of ostracism which was occasioned by the tyranny of pisistratus caused a double increase of pride to this people who were already so presumptuous thus runs the sentence of this famous law  let no one of us excel the others and if there should be one found of this description let him go and excel elsewhere by this law those whose great merit and high reputation gave umbrage to their citizens were banished for ten years   it was in it is commencement observed with so much rigor that aristides who was surnamed the just and who had performed so many great actions for the glory of his country was condemned to banishment and although this severity had greatly abated of it is rigor under alcibiades and that it was abolished in the course of time there remained in the manners and minds of the athenians a great jealousy of those who had distinguished themselves by some extraordinary merit and a rigorous severity toward their orators which constrained them to be very circumspect the rules they had imposed on them went so far as to prohibit their displaying ornaments too elaborate which might disguise their real sentiments  images and motions capable of affecting and softening their auditors  for they regarded the first as false lights that might mislead their reason and the latter as attempts to encroach on their liberty by swaying their passions it is to this we must attribute that coldness and austerity which pervade the discourses of these orators and which rather proceeded from the restraint laid on them than from the qualities of their genius   besides that the athenians were haughty jealous of their power and austere toward their orators they had an impatience and a volatility of disposition which occasioned them frequently to pass from one extreme to another by sudden and unexpected resolutions and often broke all the measures and schemes of those who attempted to gain them over to their sentiments   a hand raised or a loud cry from some factious person in an assembly was often the signal for an advice that was to be disclosed or of a counsel which was to be taken and as it happens that those who are the most insolent when they command are the most supple when they obey the athenians who had been so haughty during the prosperity of their republic were the most abject slaves to the successors of alexander and afterward to the romans when they became their masters this feeble people had in the bottom of their hearts a fund of meanness and of timidity which made them constrain their orators to conform themselves to their manners and their genius to succeed with them it became necessary to appear to respect them whilst they taught them to fear to flatter and to censure them at the same time  a policy which demosthenes who well knew this people with great success so skilfully applied   this people has however produced great men and in great numbers but they had so seldom a share in the public resolutions that their merit of which they have left so many illustrious testimonies cannot however make a general rule to judge of the character of this people  to this ingenious discrimination of the character of the athenians i cannot forbear transcribing an animated description of their luxuries carried to such an excess of refinement and opulent elegance that those who are fond of censuring our modern dissipations may be reminded that we have never yet approached those of the grecians or the romans it is extracted from dr gilliess history of greece   instead of the bread herbs and simple fare recommended by the laws of solon the athenians soon after the  0th olympiad availed themselves of their extensive commerce to import the delicacies of distant countries which were prepared by all the refinements of cookery the wines of cyprus were cooled with snow in summer in winter the most delightful flowers adorned the tables and persons of the wealthy athenians nor was it sufficient to be crowned with roses unless they were likewise anointed with the most precious perfumes parasites dancers and buffoons were an usual appendage of every entertainment among the weaker sex the passion for delicate birds distinguished by their voice or plumage was carried to such excess as merited the name of madness the bodies of such youths as were not addicted to hunting and horses which began to be a prevailing taste were corrupted by a commerce of barlots who had reduced their profession into system while their minds were still more polluted by the licentious philosophy of the sophists it is unnecessary to crowd the picture vices and extravagance took root in athens in an administration the most splendid and prosperous  perhaps this last observation is cleared up by the remarks of marville for it appears that although at the helm of administration sat such illustrious characters they had little or no share in the administration since the haughtiness and volatility of the athenians were such that they would not even bear the reprimands of their orators  it has been observed that even the mechanics in athens possessed a classic taste and a niceness of ear which could only be the effect of a general diffusion of national elegance for an anecdote of their atticism take this  philip of macedon in the present age would have merited the title of a classical scholar i have already given the noble letter he wrote to aristotle on the birth of his son the present anecdote will prove that he must have been  like the late frederick  not less partial to the contemplative minerva than to the armed pallas to give a proof of his generosity he made a present to the vanquished athenians of five thousand measures of wheat but this was not to be given by him without accompanying it by an oration while he was holding his discourse to the people he committed a solecism in language which the attic ear of an athenian immediately catching he boldly reproved him for this the classic monarch continued i grant you five thousand more  pope sixtus the fifth a singular revolution of fortune happened to pope sixtus the fifth he was originally a swineherd when he first came to rome he was constrained to beg alms having collected a little silver he one day stood deliberating with himself whether he should employ it in the purchase of a loaf which the keenness of his appetite reminded him would prove a very agreeable acquisition or in a pair of shoes which his ten toes terribly complained of wanting in this conflict of irresolution his face betrayed the anxiety of his mind a tradesman who had for some time observed his embarrassment asked him the occasion of it he told him frankly the cause but he did it in so facetious a manner that the tradesman resolved to finish his perplexity by inviting him to a good dinner when sixtus became pope he did not forget to return the dinner to the benevolent tradesman  to give an instance of his abilities as a politician when he first aspired in his mind to the popedom while he was yet a cardinal he counterfeited illness and old age for several years during the conclave which was assembled to create a pope he continually leaned on his crutch and very frequently interrupted the sage deliberations of the conclave by a hollow cough and violent spitting this scheme took so well that the cardinals fell into the trap and every one thinking that by electing sixtus he might himself stand a chance of being in a short time elected he was chosen unanimously soon after the election was concluded the new pope performed a miracle his legs became vigorous his body that had been before curbed became firm and erect his cough was dissipated and he showed in a short time of what he was capable  the senate of jesuits there is to be found in a book entitled  interets et maxims des princes et des etats souverains par m le duc de rohan cologne       an anecdote concerning the jesuits so much the more curious as neither puffendorf or vertot have noticed it in their histories though it is authority cannot be higher it was probably unknown to them  when sigismond king of sweden was elected king of poland he made a treaty with the states of sweden by which he obliged himself to pass every fifth year in that kingdom in the course of time being constrained by the wars he had with the ottoman court with muscovy and tartary to remain in poland to animate by his presence the wars he held with such powerful enemies he failed during fifteen years of accomplishing his promise to remedy this in some shape by the advice of the jusuits who had gained the ascendant over him he created a senate which was to reside at stockholm composed of forty chosen jesuits to decide on every affair of state he published a declaration in their favor and presented them with letterspatent by which he clothed them with the royal authority  while this senate of jesuits was at dantzic waiting for a fair wind to set sail for stockholm he published an edict that they should receive them as his own royal person a public council was immediately held charles the uncle of sigismond the prelates and the lords resolved to prepare for them a splendid and magnificent entry  but in a private council they came to very contrary resolutions for the prince said he could not bear that a senate of priests should command in preference to all the honors and authority of so many princes and lords natives of the country all the others agreed with him in rejecting this holy senate it was then the archbishop rose and said  since sigismond has disdained to be our king so also we must not acknowledge him as such and from this moment we should no more consider ourselves as his subjects his authority is in suspenso because he has bestowed it on the jesuits who form this senate the people have not yet acknowledged them in this interval of resignation on the one side and assumption of the other i dispense you all of the fidelity the king may claim from you as his swedish subjects when he had said this the prince of bithynia addressing himself to prince charles uncle of the king said  i own no other king than you and i believe you are now obliged to receive us as your affectionate subjects and to assist us to chase these vermin from the state all the others joined him and acknowledged charles as their lawful monarch  having resolved to keep their declaration for some time secret they deliberated in what manner they were to receive and to precede this senate in their entry into the harbor who were on board a great galleon which they had caused to cast anchor two leagues from stockholm that they might enter more magnificently in the night when the fireworks they had prepared would appear to the greatest advantage about the time of their reception prince charles accompanied by twentyfive or thirty vessels appeared before the senate wheeling about and forming a caracol of ships they discharged a volley and emptied all their cannon on the galleon of this senate which had it is sides pierced through with the balls the galleon was immediately filled with water and sunk without one of the unfortunate jesuits being assisted on the contrary they cried to them that this was the time to perform some miracle such as they were accustomed to do in india and japan and if they chose they could walk on the waters  the report of the cannon and the smoke which the powder occasioned prevented either the cries or the submersion of the holy fathers from being observed and as if they were conducting the senate to the town charles entered triumphantly went into the church where they sung te deum and to conclude the night he partook of the entertainment which had been prepared for the illfated senate  the jesuits of the city of stockholm having come about midnight to pay their respects to the fathers of the senate perceived their loss they directly posted up placards of excommunication against charles and his adherents who had caused the senate to perish they solicited the people to rebel but they were soon chased from the city and charles made a public profession of lutheranism  sigismond king of poland began a war with charles in   0  which lasted two years disturbed by the invasions of the tartars the muscovites and the cossacks a truce was concluded  the body of caesar a skilful orator sometimes employs persuasions more forcible than the figures or flowers of rhetoric can yield here is an instance   mark anthony haranguing the roman people after the death of caesar who had just been assassinated by the senate held out to the observation of the people the robe of this great man all bloody and pierced through in two and twenty places this made so great an impression on the minds of those who were present that it appeared not that caesar had been assassinated but that the conspirators were then actually assassinating him  historical misrepresentation there is a passion existing in the heart of man that i am at a loss whether to consider as proceeding from an excess of malevolence or an excess of patriotism this passion cannot bear even that the hero of a rival nation should be found to merit praise though an interval of a thousand years may have elapsed since his days whole histories have been written in this style where the historian has set out with a resolution of detracting from or denying the merits of a rival nation to give an instance in modern times   a french writer has wilfully misrepresented the famous anecdote recorded of our canute and endeavored to convey an idea that we have ever been a nation of haughty barbarians it cannot be ignorance but wilful misrepresentation the anecdote was never related but in one manner and which reflects great honor on our ancient monarch the author attempts to prove that the english nation have been overbearing from the remotest times and this he instances by giving the anecdote of canute in this senseless narration    canute king of england imitating his predecessors who called themselves lords and sovereigns of the sea resolved to take possession of this title solemnly that in future times it should not be contested persuaded that he could not render this act more authentic than by obliging the sea itself to come and pay him homage as to it is sovereign about the time of the tide he raised his throne by the seaside and there apparelled in his royal robes he held this language to the sea when it rolled toward him  know that thou art subjected to me the earth on which i sit is mine and that till now none has ever dared to revolt from my will i command thee then that thou remain where thou art without daring to approach thy lord and soil his robes scarce had he concluded this speech when a wave overturned his throne and having wetted him from his head to his feet taught him in what manner he was to rely on the obedience of this element  who does not here immediately perceive that to throw out a satirical stroke on the english nation for their naval power the author has wilfully disguised this famous reproof of canute to his courtiers and endeavored to turn into ridicule the pride and the boast of the british nation  the italians the character of the italians even so late as in the last century presents a melancholy contemplation to the philosopher how are we to account for a whole nation being infected with some of the darkest passions that stain the human soul atheism and debauchery pervaded every rank and the hand of the italian continually grasped the dagger and the drug what yet heightens the enormity of these crimes is the immortal hatred  to make use of a poetical expression  which characterized this nation of assassins naude who draws his remarks from personal observation with one or two anecdotes will inform the reader that these censures are not unjust   italy is crowded with those kinds of men who penetrate as far into nature as their abilities permit them and having done this will believe nothing more to trace god in the disorder in which the world is now we must possess modesty and humility italy abounds with libertines and atheists yet the number of their writers who have written on the immortality of the soul is incredible but i am apt to think that those very writers believe no more than the rest for i hold this maxim certain that the doubt in which they are in is one of the first causes that obliges them to write and add also that all their writings are so feeble that no one can strengthen by their sentiments his faith thus instead of instructing they make a reader perfectly skeptical  italy is a country at the same time full of impostures and superstitions some do not believe enough and others believe every thing every day without truth and without reason miracles take place i remember that a certain poor man was nearly drowned and was drawn out of the water almost dead he recovered and his recovery was firmly believed to be because he happened to have in his chaplet a medal of saint philip of neri i did not see any thing miraculous in this i said and that it certainly was not always a miracle when a man escaped from being drowned nor did i believe that saint philip thought one moment concerning the fate of this man   it is but three months since that the church of this new saint fell in at trepani when more than a dozen of the congregation who were invoking his favors got wounded and killed it was then rather that the saint should have shown his miraculous powers and have faved those good christians who were supplicating god and his saintship had this been the case it would have turned out an excellent miracle and what few miracles are accompanied by have had a considerable number of witnesses to verify it   the italians are an agreeable people enough but too frequently they are found vindictive and treacherous revenge and treachery are the great sins of the italians and the easterns and they poison to the very mice in their houses   it is a maxim received into the politics of this country however it may be inimical to the laws of christianity that it is best to defend and to avenge ourselves before worse happens as they have great sense they will never offend you but they will never pardon you if you offend them and they will pursue their revenge after an interval of fifty years has elapsed since the offense had been first given they have this proverb much in esteem   chi offend non perdona may  descartes in one of his letters writes thus  be not so desirous to live under italian skies there is a contagion that poisons it is breezes the heat of the day kindles a fever in the delicate frame the evening airs are unwholesome and the deep shades of the night conceal robberies and assassinations  the following anecdotes of italian revenge are of good authority an italian feigned to be reconciled with one who had offended him one evening when they walked out together in a retired spot the italian seized him by the back and drawing a dagger threatened to stab him if he did not abjure and curse the creator the other in vain entreated that he might not be obliged to commit what he felt a horror in doing but to save his life at length he complied the assassin having now completed his wish plunged the poignard in his bosom and exultingly exclaimed that he had revenged himself in the most dreadful manner possible for he had caused the body and the soul of his enemy to perish at a single stroke  one giuseppe bertoldo after an absence of ten years hearo that a person who had served him an ill turn resided in flourishing circumstances at india he embarks directly he arrives he follows him closely for two years and at length having found him one day alone and unarmed in a solitary spot he assassinates him  there is a narration written in italian in a manuscript in the french kings library tacked to the end of a volume entitled   le glory degl incogniti di padoua it displays a chain of treachery dishonorable to the human character i had prepared a translation of this singular transaction but as i now find that mr andrews has just given it in the addenda to his anecdotes i refer the reader to that publication in addisons travels there is an account of an assassination in italy not less remarkable than those we have noticed i shall add an instance of poisoning which cannot fail to interest the reader of sensibility  francis of medicis after the death of his lady fell deeply in love with a young noble venetian named bianca capella whom he married this lady who passionately loved the duke her husband was the cause of his death attempting to revenge herself a litalienne  as my author expresses it  of a prince who was a relation of francis she had with this design poisoned some olives that were to have been presented to him francis having met the servant took two and eat them very shortly after he began to feel their mortal effects bianca capella who now saw the mistake that had taken place and the qui pro quo that had caused the death of her beloved duke took also of the same olives and having swallowed them she threw herself on the bed embracing her dying lord and expired in his arms  critical history of poverty mr morin has formed a little history of poverty which i shall endeavor to abridge  it is difficult precisely to fix on the epoch of poverty or to mark with accuracy the moment of it is birth chronologists are silent and those who have formed genealogies of the gods have not noticed this deitys though she has been admitted as such in the pagan heaven and has had temples and altars on earth the fabulists have pleasingly narrated of her that at the feast which jupiter gave on the birth of venus she modestly stood at the gate of the palace to gather the remains of the celestial banquet when she observed plutus the god of riches inebriated not with wine but with nectar roll out of the heavenly residence and passing into the olympian gardens he threw himself on a vernal bank she seized this opportunity to become familiar with the god the frolicksome deity honored her with his caresses and from this amor sprung the god of love who resembles his father in jollity and mirth and his mother in his nudity this fabulous narration is taken from the divine plato let us now turn to it is historic extraction  poverty though of remote antiquity did not exist from the earliest times in the first age distinguished by the epithet of the golden it certainly was unknown in the terrestrial paradise it never entered this age however had but the duration of a flower when it finished poverty began to appear the ancestors of the human race if they did not meet her face to face knew her in a partial degree she must have made a rapid progress at the time of cain for josephus informs us he scoured the country with a banditti proceeding from this obscure period it is certain she was firmly established in the patriarchal age it is then we hear of merchants who publicly practiced the commerce of vending slaves which indicates the utmost degree of poverty she is distinctly marked by job this holy man protests that he had nothing to reproach himself with respecting the poor for he had assisted them in their necessities  as we advance in the scriptures we observe the legislators paid great attentions to their relief moses by his wise precautions endeavored to soften the rigours of this unhappy state the division of lands by tribes and families the septennial jubilees the regulation to bestow at the harvesttime a certain portion of all the fruits of the earth for those families who were in want and the obligation of his moral law to love ones neighbor as ones self were so many mounds erected against the inundations of poverty it was thus that the jews under their aristocratic government had few or no mendicants  their kings were unjust and rapaciously seizing on inheritances which were not their right increased the numbers of the poor from the reign of david there were oppressive governors who devoured the people as their bread it was still worse under the foreign powers of babylon of persia and the roman emperors such were the extortions of their publicans and the avarice of their governors that the number of mendicants was dreadfully augmented and it was probably for that reason that the opulent families consecrated a tenth part of their property for their succors as appears in the time of the evangelists in the preceding ages no more was given  as their casuists assure us  than the fortieth or thirtieth part a custom which this unfortunate nation to the present hour preserve and look on it as an indispensible duty so much so that if there are no poor of their nation where they reside they send it to the most distant parts the jewish merchants always make this charity a regular charge in their transactions with each other and at the close of the year render an account to the poor of their nation  by the example of moses the ancient legislators were taught to pay a similar attention to their poor like him they published laws respecting the division of lands and many ordinances were made for the benefit of those whom fires inundations wars or bad harvests had reduced to want convinced that idleness more inevitably introduced poverty than any other cause they punished it rigorously the egyptians made it criminal and no vagabonds or medicants were suffered under any pretense whatever those who were convicted of slothfulness and still refused to labor for the public when labors were offered to them were punished with death it was the egyptian taskmasters who observed that the israelites were an idle nation and obliged them to furnish bricks for the erection of those famous pyramids which are the works of men who otherwise had remained vagabonds and mendicants  the same spirit inspired greece lycurgus would not have in his republic either poor or rich they lived and labored in common as in the present times every family has it is stores and cellars so they had public ones and distributed the provisions according to the ages and constitutions of the people if the same regulation was not precisely observed by the athenians the corinthians and the other people of greece the same maxim existed in full force against idleness  according to the laws of draco solon etc a conviction of wilful poverty was punished with the loss of life plato more gentle in his manners would have them only banished he calls them enemies of the state and pronounces as a maxim that where there are great numbers of mendicants fatal revolutions will happen for as these people have nothing to lose they seize and plan opportunities to disturb the public repose  the ancient romans whose universal object was the public prosperity were not indebted to greece on this head one of the principal occupations of their censors was to keep a watch on the vagabonds those who were condemned as incorrigible sluggards were sent to the mines or made to labor on the public edifices the romans of those times unlike the present race did not consider the far niento as a pleasing occupation they were convinced that their liberalities were illplaced in bestowing them on such men the little republics of the bees and the ants were often held out as an example and the last particularly where virgil says that they have elected overseers who correct the sluggards   pars agmina cogunt castigant que moras virgil and if we may trust the narratives of our travelers the beavers pursue this regulation more rigorously and exact than even these industrious societies but their rigor although but animals is not so barbarous as that of the ancient germans who tacitus informs us plunged the idlers and vagabonds in the thickest mire of their marshes and left them to perish by a kind of death that resembled their inactive dispositions  yet after all it was not inhumanity that prompted the ancients thus severely to chastise idleness they were induced to it by a strict equity and it would be doing them injustice to suppose that it was thus they treated those unfortunate poor whose indigence was occasioned by infirmities by age or unforeseen calamities they perhaps exceeded us in genuine humanity every family constantly assisted it is branches to save them from being reduced to beggary which to them appeared worse than death the magistrates protected those who were destitute of friends or incapable of labor when ulysses was disguised as a mendicant and presented himself to eurymachus this prince observing him to be robust and healthy offered to give him employment or otherwise to leave him to his ill fortune when the roman emperors even in the reigns of nero and tiberius bestowed their largesses the distributors were ordered to except those from receiving a share whose bad conduct kept them in misery for that it was better the lazy should die with hunger than be fed in idleness  whether the police of the ancients was more exact or whether they were more attentive to practice the duties of humanity or that slavery served as an efficacious corrective of idleness it clearly appears how little was the misery and how few the numbers of their poor this they did too without having recourse to hospitals  at the establishment of christianity when the apostles commanded a community of riches among their disciples the miseries of the poor became alleviated in a greater degree if they did not absolutely live together as we have seen religious orders yet the rich continually supplied their distressed brethren but matters greatly changed under constantine this prince with the best intentions published edicts in favor of those christians who had been condemned in the preceding reigns to slavery to the mines the galleys or prisons the church felt an inundation of prodigious crowds of these unhappy men who brought with them urgent wants and corporeal infirmities the christian families formed then but a few they could not satisfy these men the magistrates protected them they built spacious hospitals under different titles for the sick the aged the invalids the widows and orphans the emperors and the most eminent personages were seen in these hospitals examining the patients sometimes they assisted the helpless and sometimes dressed the wounded this did so much honor to the new religion that julian the apostate introduced this custom among the pagans but the best things are seen continually perverted  these retreats were found not sufficient many slaves proud of the liberty they had just recovered looked on them as prisons and under various pretexts wandered about the country they displayed with art the scars of their former wounds and exposed the imprinted marks of their chains they found thus a lucrative profession in begging which had been interdicted by the laws the profession did not finish with them men of an untoward turbulent and licentious disposition gladly embraced it it spread so wide that the succeeding emperors were obliged to institute new laws and it was permitted to individuals to seize on these mendicants for their slaves and perpetual vassals a powerful preservative against this disorder it is observed in almost every part of the world but ours and it is thus that nowhere they so abound with beggars china presents us with a noble example no beggars are seen loitering in their country all the world are occupied even to the blind and the lame those who are incapable of labor live at the public expense what is done there may also be performed here then instead of that hideous importunate idle licentious poverty  as pernicious to the police as to morality  we should see the poverty of the earlier ages humble modest frugal robust industrious and laborious then indeed the fable of plato might be realized poverty may be embraced by the god of riches and if she did not produce the vuluptuous offspring of love she would become the fertile mother of agriculture and the ingenious mother of the fine arts and of all kinds of manufactures  slavery i have chiefly collected the present anecdotes from the ingenious compiler of lesprit des usages et des coutumes  it avails little to exclaim against slavery it is an evil so natural to man that it is impossible totally to eradicate it man will be a tyrant and if he possessed an adequate strength he would enslave whatever surrounded him dominion is so flattering to pride and to idleness that it is impossible to sacrifice it is enjoyments even the slave himself requires to be attended by another slave it is thus with the negro of labat who since his state permits of none assumes a despotic authority over his wife and children  there are slaves even with savages and if force cannot establish servitude they employ other means to supply it the chief of the natches of louisiana disposes at his will of the property of his subjects they dare not even refuse him their head he is a perfect despotic prince when the presumptive heir is born the people devote to him all the children at the breast to serve him during his life this petit chief is a very sesostris he is treated in his cabin as the emperor of china is in his palace indeed the origin of his power is great the natches adore the sun and this sovereign has palmed himself on them for the brother of the sun  servitude is sometimes as pleasing to the slave as it is gratifying to the master and can any thing more strongly convince us that the greater part of men are unworthy of tasting the sweets of liberty it was thus when the monarchs of france were desirous of despoiling the barons of the authority they had usurped the bondmen accustomed to slavery were slow in claiming their liberty to effect this it became necessary to compel them by laws and louis hutin ordered that those villains or bondmen who would not be enfranchised should pay heavy fines  the origin of slavery in some countries arises from singular circumstances if a tartar met in his way a man or woman who could not show a passport from the king he would seize on the person as his right and property  formerly in circassia when the husband and wife did not agree they went to complain to the governor of the town if the husband was the first who arrived the governor caused the woman to be seized on and sold and gave another to the husband and on the contrary he seized on and sold the husband if the wife arrived the first  liberality and the desire of obliging  who could credit it  occasion the depriving others of their liberty an islander of mindanao who redeems his son from slavery makes him his own slave and children exercise the same benevolence and rigor on their parents  in rome the debtor became the slave of his creditor and when it happened that they could take nothing from him who had lost every thing they took his liberty it is even believed that the law of the twelve tables permitted them to cut into pieces an insolvent debtor  it is since the establishment of the commerce and sale of negroes that men have committed the most enormous crimes the mulattoes of loanda seduce the young women wherever they pass they return to them some years afterward and under the pretext of giving the children a better education they carry them off to sell them  thus also the women of benguela in collusion with their husbands allure other men to their arms the husband falls suddenly on them imprisons the unfortunate gallants and sells them the first opportunity and he is not punished for these violences  besides the negroes sell their children their parents and their neighbors they lead to the country house of the merchant their unsuspicious victims and there deliver them into the hands of their purchaser while they are loaded with chains and separated for ever from their most endearing connections it is in vain they raise loud and melancholy cries the infamous vender smiles and says it is only a cunning trick le maire informs us that an old negro resolved to sell his son but the son who suspected his design hastened to the factor and having taken him aside sold him his father  the islanders of bissagos are passionately fond of spirituous liquors and on the arrival of a vessel the weakest without distinction of age friendship or relationship become the prey of the strongest that they may sell them to purchase liquors  it appears that in the east and particularly at batavia the life of a slave entirely depends on the caprices of his master the slightest fault brings on him the most afflicting treatment they bind him to a gallows they flog him unmercifully with splitted canes his blood flows in a stream and his body is covered with wounds but fearful that he may not die in sufficient tortures they scatter abundantly over them salt and pepper so little care is paid to these unfortunate men amongst the maldivians that they lie entirely at the mercy of every one those who practice on them any ill treatment receive only half the punishment that the laws exact from any one who had illtreated a free person the slightest chastisement which is inflicted on them at java is to carry about their necks a piece of wood with a chain and which they are condemned to drag all their lives  the slaves of the kingdom of angola and many other countries of africa never address their masters but on their knees they do not even allow them the honors of decent burial they throw their bodies in the woods where they become the food of wild beasts  if those on the gold coast escape and are retaken they lose an ear for the first offense of this kind a second offense is punished with the loss of the other at the third it is allowed their masters either to sell them to the europeans or to cut off their heads  religious fanaticism increases the inhumanity of the pirates of africa the moors and the europeans reciprocally detest each other and since they redeem their captives the mahometans have become unmerciful that they may the more powerfully excite their friends to redeem them with heavy ransoms we must not credit every thing historians record but it is certain that the police does not punish the master who kills his slaves that religious prejudices totally stifle the feelings of humanity and that the zealous mussulman inflicts continual tortures on these unfortunate men that they may abjure their religion  the spaniards and the knights of malta for their reprisals chain to the galley all the mahometans they make prisoners and it is thus that the fate of the christian slaves on the northern coast of africa is the natural consequence of a war which never can terminate  when the negroes of the colonies solely depend on a brutal master who can paint the horrors of their situation without dwelling on the cruelties which they suffer in africa before they are sold and during the voyage the greater part believe that after their embarkment from america the europeans intend to massacre them in the most terrible manner imaginable to burn calcine and pulverize their bones to be employed as gunpowder and they also imagine that the europeans manufacture an oil with their fat and marrow  if they do not finish their task they are lashed with rods till they are covered with blood sometimes they pour over their raw wounds a pound of melted pitch and sometimes they heighten their unsupportable smart by scattering over them handfuls of pepper  the habit of suffering endows them with an admirable patience it is thus labat expresses himself on this head they are seldom heard to cry out or to complain it is not owing to insensibility for their flesh is extremely delicate and their feelings irritable it proceeds from an uncommon magnanimity of soul which sets at defiance pain grief and death itself i have more than once seen some broken on the wheel and others tormented by the most dreadful machines inventive cruelty could produce without their giving vent to one murmur or shedding one tear i saw a negro burnt who was so far from being affected that he called for a little lighted tobacco on his way to the place of execution and i observed him smoke with great calmness at the moment his feet were consuming in the midst of the flames there were two negroes condemned the one to the gallows the other to be whipped by the hand of the executioner the priest in a mistake confessed him who was not to have died they did not perceive it till the moment the executioner was going to throw him off they made him descend the other was confessed and although he expected only to be whipped he mounted the ladder with as much indifference as the first descended from it and as if the choice of either fate was alike to him  how grievous must be the unfortunate destiny of those negroes when they possess a soul so great and sentiments so sublime atkins examining once some slaves observed one of a noble slature who appeared to him not less vigorous than imperious he glanced on his companions whenever they murmured or wept looks of reproach and disdain he never turned his eyes on the overseer and if commanded to rise or to stretch his leg he did not by any means immediately obey his exasperated master wearied himself with lashing his naked body with his rod he was going to dispatch him in his fury had it not been observed to him that if he sold him he might get an uncommon price for a slave of his appearance the negro supported this persecution with heroic intrepidity he preserved a rigid silence a tear or two only trickled down his cheek when as if he blushed for his weakness he turned aside to hide them i learnt atkins writes that he was a chief of some villages who had just come from opposing the slavetraffic of the english mr mackenzie in one of his novels has described this scene with the pen of a master and certainly draws the picture after the description of atkins  many european nations abandon the negroes to the caprice of their masters or to the despotic decision of the magistrate the french have drawn up some regulations which have been called the black code this article trespasses so much on our usual limits that we cannot extract any for the contemplation of the reader let it be sufficient however to observe that they are eternal records of european cupidity and european inhumanity  in a word they have reduced them to the degree of brutes and they have treated them with infinitely more inhumanity whatever the arbitrary decrees of a planter  continues our ingenious compiler  may perform they cannot take from them the human figure nor the human voice they seem indeed exasperated to find that they bear an affinity to their own species  a new religion all the world knows how successful some impostors have been in the establishment of religions we europeans are well persuaded that the jewish and the christian are derived from divine authority we are perfectly satisfied that mahomet manco capac confucius the lama of tartary are impostors though a greater number of nations respect their various holy scriptures than the true bible as voyagers have made new discoveries new religions have been discovered the list of religious impostors it is not difficult to augment the jews have seen five or six fictitious messiahs  sabbatei sevi the most remarkable of them i am convinced that not a few religions have failed in their establishment and i will oppose to these impostors a man who was more learned and able than any of them but circumstances were not favorable to his system he had not like mahomet to join with his alcoran a good armoury of swords in his possession  about the middle of the fifteenth century some time before the turks had become masters of constantinople a great number of philosophers flourished gemistus plethon was one distinguished by the excellence of his genius by the depth of his erudition and chiefly by his being a warm platonist such were his eminent abilities that in his old age those whom his novel system had greatly irritated either feared or respected him he had scarcely breathed his last moments when they began to abuse plato and our plethon here is an account written by george of trebizond    there has lately arose amongst us a second mahomet and this second if we do not take care will exceed in greatness the first by the dreadful consequences of his wicked doctrine as the first has exceeded plato a disciple and rival of this philosopher in philosophy in eloquence and in science he had fixed his residence in the peloponnese his common name was gemistus but he assumed that of plethon perhaps gemistus to make us believe more easily that he was descended from heaven and to engage us to receive more readily his doctrine and his new law wished to change his name according to the manner of the ancient patriarchs of whom it is said that at the time the name was changed they were called to the greatest things he has written with wonderful art and with great elegance he has given new rules for the conduct of life and for the regulation of human affairs and at the same time has vomited forth a great number of blasphemies against the catholic religion it is certain he was so zealous a platonist that he entertained no other sentiments than those of plato concerning the nature of the gods souls sacrifices etc i have heard him myself when we were together at florence say that in a few years all men on the face of the earth would embrace with one common consent and with one mind a single and simple religion at the first instructions which should be given by a single preaching and when i asked him if it would be the religion of jesus christ or that of mahomet he answered neither one nor the other but a third which will not greatly differ from paganism these words i heard with so much indignation that since that time i have always hated him i look upon him as a dangerous viper and i cannot think of him without abhorrence  the pious writer of this account is too violently agitated he might perhaps have bestowed a smile of pity or contempt but the bigots of religion are not less insane than the impious themselves  it was when plethon died that the malice of his enemies collected all it is venom we cannot but acknowledge from this circumstance that his abilities must have been astonishingly vast to have kept such crowds silent and it is not improbable this scheme of impiety was less impious than the majority of the people imagined not a few catholic writers lament that his book was burnt and greatly regret the loss of plethons work which they say was not meant to subvert the christian religion but only to unfold the system of plato and to collect what he and other philosophers had written on religion and politics at the same time however we must recollect the express words of plethon which we come from transcribing as given us by george of trebizond  of his religious scheme the reader may now judge by this summary account the general title of the volume ran thus  this book treats of the laws of the best form of government and what all men must observe in their public and private stations to live together in the most perfect the most innocent and the most happy manner the whole was divided into three books the titles of the chapters where paganism was openly inculcated are reported by gennadius who condemned it to the flames but who has not thought proper to enter into the manner of his arguments etc the impiety and the extravagance of this new legislator appeared above all in the articles which concerned religion he acknowledges a plurality of gods some superior whom he placed above the heavens and the others inferior on this side the heavens the first existing from the remotest antiquity the others younger and of different ages he gave a king to all these gods and he called him eyes  or jupiter  as the pagans named this power formerly according to him the stars had a soul the demons were not malignant spirits and the world was eternal he established polygamy and was even inclined to a community of women all his work was filled with such follies and with not a few impieties which my pious author will not venture to give  what the intentions of plethon were it would be rash and ungenerous in us to determine if the work was only an arrangement of the heathen notions it was an innocent and curious volume it is allowed that he was uncommonly learned and humane and had not passed his life entirely in the solitary recesses of his study  i cannot quit this article without recollecting two similar works even of the present day the ideas of the phrenetic emanuel swedenburgh are warmly cherished by a sect who have so far disgraced themselves as to bestow on their society the name of this man it is but very lately that a work was published by a mr t tailor who openly professed paganism a book published by the athenian stuart as he is called is not less to be distinguished  yet we have only one hospital dedicated to saint luke in this metropolis  edward the fourth our edward the fourth was a gay and voluptuous prince and what is singular he probably owed to his enormous debts and passion for the fairsex his crown he had not one jane shore but many hear honest philip de comines his contemporary he says that what greatly contributed to his entering london as soon as he appeared at it is gates was the great debts this prince had contracted which made his creditors gladly assist him and the high favor in which he was held by the bourgeoises into whose good graces he had frequently glided and who gained him over their husbands  who i suppose for the tranquillity of their lives were glad to depose or raise monarchs  these are de comines words  many ladies and rich citizens wives of whom formerly he had great privacies and familiar acquaintance gained over to him their husbands and relations  this is the description of his voluptuous life we must recollect that the writer had been an eyewitness and was an honest man while modern historians only view objects through the colored medium of their imagination and do not always merit the latter appellation   he had been during the last twelve years more accustomed to his ease and pleasures than any other prince who lived in his time he had nothing in his thoughts but les dames and of them more than was reasonable and huntingmatches good eating and great care of his person when he went in their seasons to these huntingmatches he always caused to be carried with him great pavilions for les dames and at the same time gave splendid entertainments so that it is not surprising that his person was as jolly as any one i ever saw he was then young and as handsome as any man of his age but he has since become enormously fat  since i have got old philip in my hand the reader will not perhaps be displeased if he attends to a little more of his naivete which will appear in the form of a conversazione of the times he now relates what passed between edward and the king of france    when the ceremony of the oath was concluded our king who was desirous of being friendly began to say to the king of england in a laughing way that he must come to paris and be jovial amongst our ladies and that he would give him the cardinal de bourbon for his confessor who would very willingly absolve him of any sin which perchance he might commit the king of england seemed wellpleased at the invitation and laughed heartily for he knew that the said cardinal was un fort bon compagnon when the king was returning he spoke on the road to me and said that he did not like to find the king of england so much inclined to come to paris he is said he a very handsome king he likes the women too much he may probably find one at paris that may make him like to come too often or stay too long his predecessors have already been too much at paris and in normandy and that his company was not agreeable this side of the sea but that beyond the sea he wished to be bon friar et amy  i feel an inclination to give another conversationpiece but lest the reader should not so keenly relish the honest old narrator as myself it may be necessary to restrain my pen  a relic henry the third was deeply tainted with the vilest superstition he was a prince of a dastardly disposition and like all bigots endeavored by mean subterfuge and low cunning to circumvent others incapable of that noble frankness which characterizes an honest man not bigoted to the senseless rites of superstition as an instance of his bigotry take this account of a relic which is too curious to abridge    henry summoned all the great men of the kingdom a d      to come to london on the festival of saint edward to receive an account of a certain sacred benefit which heaven had lately bestowed on england the singular strain of this summons excited the most eager curiosity and brought great multitudes to london at the time appointed when they were all assembled in saint pauls church the king acquainted them that the great master of the knights templars had sent him by one of his knights a phial of crystal containing a small portion of the precious blood of christ which he had shed upon the cross for the salvation of the world attested to be genuine by the seals of the patriarch of jerusalem of several archbishops bishops and abbots this he informed them he designed to carry the next day in solemn procession to westminster attended by them and by all the clergy of london in their proper habits with their banners crucifixes and waxcandles and exhorted all who were present to prepare themselves for that sacred solemnity by spending the night in watching fasting and devout exercises on the morrow when the procession was put in order the king approached the sacred phial with reverence fear and trembling took it in both his hands and holding it up higher than his face proceeded under a canopy two assistants supporting his arms such was the devotion of henry on this occasion that though the road between saint pauls and westminster was very deep and miry he kept his eyes constantly fixed on the phial or on heaven when the procession approached westminster it was met by two monks of that abbey who conducted it into the church where the king deposited the venerable relic which says the historian made all england shine with glory dedicating it to god and saint edward  vicar of bray the reader has frequently heard this revered son of the church mentioned probably his name may have outlived the recollection of his pious maneuvers  the vicar of bray in berkshire was a papist under the reign of henry the eighth and a protestant under edward the sixth he was a papist again under queen mary and at length became a protestant in the reign of queen elizabeth when this scandal to the gown was reproached for his versatility of religious creeds he made answer  i cannot help that but if i changed my religion i am sure i kept true to my principle which is to live and die vicar of bray  spanish etiquette the etiquette  or rules to be observed in the royal palaces  is necessary observes baron bielfield for keeping order at court in spain it was carried to such lengths as to make martyrs of their kings here is an instance at which in spite of the fatal consequences it produced one cannot refrain from smiling   philip the third being gravely seated  as spaniards generally are  by a chimney where the firemaker of the court had kindled so great a quantity of wood that the monarch was nearly suffocated with heat his grandeur would not suffer him to rise from the chair and the domestics could not presume to enter the apartment because it was against the etiquette at length the marquis de potat appeared and the king ordered him to damp the fires but he excused himself alleging that he was forbidden by the etiquette to perform such a function for which the duke dusseda ought to be called upon as it was his business the duke was gone out the fire burnt fiercer and the king endured it rather than derogate from his dignity but his blood was heated to such a degree that an erysipelas broke out in his head the next day which being succeeded by a violent fever carried him off in      and in the twentyfourth year of his age  the palace was once on fire when a soldier who knew the kings sister was in her apartment and must inevitably have been consumed in a few moments by the flames at the risk of his life rushed in and brought her highness safe out in his arms but the spanish etiquette was here woefully broken into the loyal soldier was brought to trial and as it was impossible to deny that he had entered her apartment the judges condemned him to die the spanish princess however condescended in consideration of the circumstance to pardon the soldier and very benevolently saved his life  after this we may exclaim with our english satirist  spain gives us pride  which spain to all the earth may largely give nor fear herself a dearth churchill  hell the cardinal bellarmin in his treatise du purgatoire seems to be as familiarly acquainted with the secret tracks and the formidable divisions of  the bottomless pit as swedenburgh was with the streets and byecorners of  the new jerusalem  he informs us that there are beneath the earth four different places or a profound place divided into four parts he says that the deepest place is hell which contains all the souls of the damned where will be also their bodies after the resurrection and where likewise will be enclosed all the demons the place nearest hell is purgatory where souls are purged or rather where they appease the anger of god by their sufferings he says that the same fires and the same torments alike afflict in both these places and that the only difference between hell and purgatory consists in their duration next to purgatory is the limbo of those infants who die without having received the sacrament and the fourth place is the limbo of the fathers that is to say of those just men who died before the death of jesus christ but since the days of the redeemer this last division is empty so that here is an apartment to be let  such ideas are the tenets which some from the dawn of their reason entertain with religious veneration it has even been acknowledged by the bigots that the more ridiculous or the more unintelligible may be the subject for belief the greater merit it is to receive it without hesitation men have persuaded themselves that what bears the strongest evidence of falsehood is the sacred truth of a paternal deity and it had been well if on speculative points they had only differed with their more rational or innocent fellow creatures but these bigots have written in the warm blood of humanity the articles of their faith they have reared an altar to superstition on which they have not sacrificed the scapegoat or the paschal lamb but they have plunged the sacerdotal knife into the bosom of their fellow creatures they have agonized the individual with the flaming auto da fes of the inquisition with a more dreadful scope they have sent thousands with the sword of the crusade to spread desolation in parts which had never till then heard of their name and gratifying at once their avarice and their religion cities have been razed and millions of inoffensive men swept from the face of the earth because it had pleased providence to place in their countries mines of gold and seas of pearl  douglas it may be recorded as a species of puritanic savageness and gothic barbarism that no later than in the year      a man of genius was persecuted because he had written a tragedy which tended by no means to hurt the morals but on the contrary by awakening the sweetest pity and the nobler passions would rather elevate the soul and purify the mind  when mr home the author of the tragedy of douglas had it performed at edinburgh and because some of the divines his acquaintance attended the representation the clergy with the monastic spirit of the darkest ages published the present paper which i shall abridge for the contemplation of the reader who may wonder to see such a composition written in the eighteenth century   on wednesday february the  d      the presbytery of glasgow came to the following resolution they having seen a printed paper entitled  an admonition and exhortation of the reverend presbytery of edinburgh which among other evils prevailing observing the following melancholy but notorious facts that one who is a minister of the church of scotland did himself write and compose a stage play entitled  the tragedy of douglas and got it to be acted at the theater of edinburgh and that he with several other ministers of the church were present and some of them oftener than once at the acting of the said play before a numerous audience the presbytery being deeply affected with this new and strange appearance do publish these sentiments etc  sentiments with which i will not disgust the reader  the lovers heart the following tale is recorded in the historical memoirs of champagne by bougier it has been a favorite narrative with the old romance writers and the principal incident however objectionable has been displayed in several modern poems it is probable that the true history will be acceptable for it is tender and amorous incident to the fair reader  the lord de coucy vassal to the count de champagne was one of the most accomplished youths of his time he loved with an excess of passion the lady of the lord du fayel who felt for him reciprocal ardours it was with the most poignant grief this lady heard her lover acquaint her that he had resolved to accompany the king and the count de champagne to the wars of the holy land but she could not oppose his wishes because she hoped that his absence might dissipate the jealousy of her husband the time of departure having come these two lovers parted with sorrows of the most lively tenderness the lady in quitting her lover presented him with some rings some diamonds and with a string that she had woven herself of his own hair intermixed with silk and buttons of large pearls to serve him according to the fashion of those days to tie a magnificent hood which covered his helmet this he gratefully accepted and instantly departed  when he arrived in palestine he received at the siege of acre in      in gloriously ascending the ramparts a wound which was declared mortal he employed the few moments he had to live in writing to the lady du fayel and he made use of those fervid expressions which were natural to him in his afflictive situation he ordered his squire to embalm his heart after his death and to convey it to his beloved mistress with the presents he had received from her hands in quitting her  the squire faithful to the dying commands of his master returned immediately to france to present the heart and the presents to the lady of du fayel but when he approached the castle of this lady he concealed himself in the neighboring wood till he could find some favorable moment to complete his promise he had the misfortune to be observed by the husband of this lady who recognized him and who immediately suspected he came in search of his wife with some message from his master he threatened to deprive him of his life if he did not divulge what had occasioned him to come there the squire gave him for answer that his master was dead but du fayel not believing it drew his sword to murder him this man frightened at the peril in which he found himself confessed every thing and put into his hands the heart and letter of his master du fayel prompted by the fellest revenge ordered his cook to mince the heart and having mixed it with meat he caused a ragout to be made which he knew pleased the taste of his wife and had it served to her this lady eat greedily of the dish after the repast du fayel inquired of his wife if she had found the ragout according to her taste she answered him that she had found it excellent it is for this reason he replied that i caused it to be served to you for it is a kind of meat which you very much liked you have madam the savage du fayel continued eat the heart of the lord de coucy but this she would not believe till he showed her the letter of her lover with the string of his hair and the diamonds she had given him then shuddering in the anguish of her sensations and urged by the darkest despair she told him  it is true that i loved that heart because it merited to be loved for never could it find it is superior and since i have eaten of so noble a meat and that my stomach is the tomb of so precious a heart i will take care that nothing of inferior worth shall be mixed with it grief and passion choked her utterance she retired into her chamber she closed the door for ever and refusing to accept of consolation or food the amiable victim expired on the fourth day  the history of gloves the present learned and curious dissertation i have compiled from the papers of an ingenious antiquarian the originals are to be found in the republic of letters vol x p      to proceed regularly we must first enquire into the antiquity of this part of dress and secondly show it is various uses in the several ages of the world  some have given them a very early original imagining they are noticed in the  0 th psalm where the royal prophet declares he will cast his shoe over edom they go still higher supposing them to be used in the times of the judges ruth iv   where it is said it was the custom for a man to take off his shoe and give it to his neighbor as a token of redeeming or exchanging any thing they tell us the word which in these two texts is usually translated shoe is by the chaldee paraphrast in the latter rendered glove casaubon is of opinion that gloves were worn by the chaldeans because the word here mentioned is in the talmud lexicon explained the clothing of the hand but it must be confessed all these are mere conjectures and the chaldean paraphrast has taken an unallowable liberty in his version  let us then be content to begin with the authority of xenophon he gives a clear and distinct account of gloves speaking of the manners of the persians he gives us a proof of their effeminacy that not satisfied with covering their head and their feet they also guarded their hands against the cold with thick gloves homer speaking of laertes at work in his garden represents him with gloves on his hands to secure them from the thorns varro an ancient writer is an evidence in favor of their antiquity among the romans in lib ii cap    de re rustica he says that olives gathered by the naked hand are preferable to those gathered with gloves athenaeus speaks of a celebrated glutton who always came to table with gloves on his hands that he might be able to handle and eat the meat while hot and devour more than the rest of the company  these authorities show that the ancients were not strangers to gloves though perhaps their use might not be so common as amongst us when the ancient severity of manners declined the use of gloves prevailed among the romans but not without some opposition from the philosophers musonius a philosopher who lived at the close of the first century of christianity among other invectives against the corruption of the age says it is a shame that persons in perfect health should clothe their hands and feet with soft and hairy coverings their convenience however soon made their use general pliny the younger informs us in his account of his uncles journey to vesuvius that his secretary sat by him ready to write down whatever occurred remarkable and that he had gloves on his hands that the coldness of the weather might not impede his business  in the beginning of the ninth century the use of gloves was become so universal that ever the church thought a regulation in that part of dress necessary in the reign of lewis le debonnaire the council of aix ordered that the monks should only wear gloves made of sheepskin  that time has made alterations in the form of this as in all other apparel appears from the old pictures and monuments  let us now proceed to point out the various uses of gloves in the several ages for beside their original design for a covering of the hand they have been employed on several great and solemn occasions as in the ceremony of investitures in bestowing lands or in conferring dignities giving possession by the delivery of a glove prevailed in several parts of christendom in later ages in the year  00  the bishops of paderborn and moncerco were put into possession of their sees by receiving a glove it was thought so essential a part of the episcopal habit that some abbots in france presuming to wear gloves the council of poitiers interposed in the affair and forbid them the use of them on the same footing with the ring and sandals as being peculiar to bishops  monsieur favin observes that the custom of blessing gloves at the coronation of the kings of france which still subsists is a remain of the eastern practice of investiture by a glove a remarkable instance of this ceremony is recorded in the german history the unfortunate conradin was deprived of his crown and his life by the usurper mainfroy when having ascended the scaffold the injured prince lamented his hard fate he asserted his right to the crown and as a token of investiture threw his glove among the crowd begging it might be conveyed to some of his relations who should revenge his death it was taken up by a knight who brought it to peter king of arragon who was afterward crowned at palermo  as the delivery of gloves was once a part of the ceremony used in giving possession so the depriving a person of them was a mark of divesting him of his office and of degrading him andrew herkley earl of carlisle was in the reign of edward the second impeached of holding a correspondence with the scots and condemned to die as a traitor walsingham relating other circumstances of his degradation says  his spurs were cut off with a hatchet and his gloves and shoes were taken off etc  another use of gloves was in a duel on which occasion he who threw one down was thereby understood to give defiance and he who took it up to accept the challenge  the use of single combat at first designed only for a trial of innocence like the ordeal fire and water was in succeeding ages practiced for deciding right and property challenging by the glove was continued down to the reign of queen elizabeth as appears by an account given by spelman of a duel appointed to be fought in tothill fields in the year      the dispute was concerning some lands in the county of kent the plaintiffs appeared in court and demanded a single combat one of them threw down his glove which the other immediately took up carried off on the point of his sword and the day of fighting was appointed but the matter was adjusted in an amicable manner by the queens judicious interference  though such combats are now no longer in use we have one ceremony still remaining among us in which the challenge is given by a glove viz at the coronation of the kings of england upon which occasion his majestys champion completely armed and well mounted enters westminster hall and proclaims that if any man shall deny the princes title to the crown he is ready to maintain and defend it by single combat after which declaration he throws down his glove or gauntlet as a token of defiance  this custom of challenging by the glove is still in use in some parts of the world it is common in germany on receiving an affront to send a glove to the offending party as a challenge to a duel  the last use of gloves to be mentioned here was for carrying the hawk which is very ancient in former times princes and other great men took so much pleasure in carrying the hawk on their hand that some of them have chosen to be represented in this attitude there is a monument of philip the first of france still remaining on which he is represented at length on his tomb holding a glove in his hand  mr chambers says that formerly judges were forbid to wear gloves on the bench no reason is assigned for this prohibition our judges lie under no such restraint for both they and the rest of the court make no difficulty of receiving gloves from the sheriffs whenever the session or assize concludes without any one receiving sentence of death which is called a maiden assize this custom is of great antiquity  our curious antiquarian has also preserved a very singular anecdote concerning gloves chambers informs us that it is not safe at present to enter the stables of princes without pulling off the gloves he does not indeed tell us in what the danger consists a friend from germany explains the matter he says it is an ancient established custom in that country that whoever enters the stables of a prince or great man with his gloves on his hands is obliged to forfeit them or redeem them by a fee to the servants the same custom is observed in some places at the death of the stag in which case the gloves if not taken off are redeemed by money given to the huntsmen and keepers this is practiced in france and the late king never failed of pulling off one of his gloves on that occasion the reason of this ceremony is not known  we meet with the term glovemoney in our old records by which is meant money given to servants to buy gloves this no doubt gave rise to the saying of giving a pair of gloves to signify making a present for some favor or service  to the honor of the glove it has more than once been admitted as a term of the tenure or holding lands one bortran who came in with william the conqueror held the manor of farnham royal by the service of providing a glove for the kings right hand on the day of his coronation and supporting the same hand that day while the king held the royal scepter in the year      simon de mertin gave a grant of his lands in consideration of fifteen shillings one pair of white gloves at easter and one pound of cummin  curiosities of literature miscellanea artificial memory the present is an article that perhaps may be thought by many readers apocryphal  when muretus was at rome says scaliger  by was of parenthesis i must observe the relator and the auditor were the two first scholars in europe  there came one day to the palace of the french ambassador a florentine of a very illfavored countenance and whose eyes were continually declined on the ground it was said that he possessed in a wonderful degree an artificial memory to give a proof of his powers he begged the company who were numerous to seat themselves regularly that he might not be disturbed and that they would order to be written down to the number of fifty thousand words assuring them that if they pronounced them distinctly and if afterward they were read slowly he would repeat every word without hesitation this was done they would only have troubled him with a few but he insisted that they should proceed the secretary of the ambassador was employed full two hours in writing the most singular words the company could select and among them was a cardinal peleve who gave him polysyllables in the best or longest manner of our late lexicographer the florentine to the astonishment of the audience recited them without the smallest omission and this he did beginning sometimes at the end and sometimes in the middle he said that this artificial memory had caused him totally to lose his natural one  jedediah buxtons singular memory appears to have been of a different cast he could only count words etc for when he went to the play he is said to have enumerated the words of garrick and the steps of the dancers but he had not like this man any one who could be capable of contradicting him  beards the delight of ancient beauties when the fair were accustomed to behold their lovers with beards the sight of a shaved chin excited sentiments of horror and aversion as much indeed as in this effeminate age would a gallant whose hairy excrement should stream like a meteor to the troubled air   to obey the injunctions of his bishops louis the seventh of france cropped his hair and shaved his beard eleanor of acquitaine his consort found him with this uncommon appearance very ridiculous and very contemptible she revenged herself by becoming something more than a coquette the king obtained a divorce she then married the count of anjou who shortly after ascended the english throne she gave him for her marriage dower the rich provinces of poitou and guienne and this was the origin of those wars which for three hundred years ravaged france and which cost the french nation three millions of men all which probably had never taken place if louis the seventh had not been so rash as to crop his hair and shave his beard by which he became so disgustful in the eyes of the fair eleanor  waxwork waxwork has been brought sometimes to a wonderful perfection we have heard of many curious deceptions occasioned by the imitative powers of this plastic matter there have been several exhibitions in london which have pretended to an excellence they did not attain it must be confessed that a saloon occupied by figures that represent eminent personages forms a grand idea to approach voltaire franklin or the great frederick yields to their admirers a delightful sensation if we contemplate with pleasure an insipid portrait how much greater is the pleasure when in an assemblage they appear wanting nothing but that language and those actions which a fine imagination can instantaneously bestow  there was a work of this kind which menage has noticed and which must have appeared a little miracle in the year      the duke of maine received a gilt cabinet about the size of a moderate table on the door was inscribed  the chamber of wit the inside displayed an alcove and a long gallery in an armchair was seated the figure of the duke himself composed of wax the resemblance the most perfect imaginable on one side stood the duke de la rochefoucault to whom he presented a paper of verses for his examination mr de marcillac and bossuet bishop of meaux were standing near the armchair in the alcove madame de thianges and madame de la fayette sat retired reading a book boileau the satirist stood at the door of the gallery hindering seven or eight bad poets from entering near boileau stood racine who seemed to beckon to la fontaine to come forwards all these figures were formed of wax and this imitation must have been at once curious for it is ingenuity and interesting for the personages it imitated  anatomists the ancient anatomists must have felt a zeal for the science which makes the imagination shudder it was nothing less than dissecting men alive for this purpose the bodies of criminals were devoted this was the exercise of herophilus an ancient physician who tertullian very justly treats as a butcher or as we might say in the present age a cannibal  monks  the monks of the present day says charpentier who died in the year   0  lead sober lives when compared with their predecessors some religious fathers were called the hogs of saint anthony they retired from the world to make eight repasts per diem the order of the chartreux was of a different complexion it was in it is orginal institution more austere than that of la trappe amongst other regulations of their food it was written that with barley bread water and pulse they were fully satisfied and again they promise to preserve perpetual fasting perpetual silence and perpetual haircloth every saturday night was brought to each father his portion of food for the week with which they accommodated themselves in their own cells widely separated from each other but this mortification was not long held in esteem their severities were mitigated more and more till at length they have improved the order greatly by admitting many of the luxuries of life they now eat instead of the dry barley bread which was brought to them on the saturday nights the newest loaves made of the whitest flour instead of water they drink the richest wines in greater quantities than heretofore they drank water the pulse was found rather insipid food so they have joined to it excellent fish and in fact there is no luxury in which these fathers who were enjoined by their founder perpetual fasts do not indulge their appetites ah happy convents bosomed deep in vines where slumber abbots purple as their wines pope   mr merry the author of the della crusca poems when he can get rid of his load of poetic tinsel presents sometimes a thought of the true gold he has written an elegy on a view of the chartreux in which are these excellent lines  it is not by losing life that heaven ye gain it is not solitude that leads to god   aetna and vesuvius it is very probable that mount vesuvius near naples and mount aetna in sicily form but different portions of one chain of mountains that passes under the sea and the isle of lipari for whenever one of these volcanos has a great eruption it is observed that the other and the volcano in the isle of lipari throw out more flames than ordinary this remark is made by huet  roads the magnificence of the romans in their public edifices infinitely surpassed that of the last ages the sole inspection of their roads is a most convincing proof these roads set out from the column erected in the middle of rome and extended themselves to the remotest borders of this vast empire for the convenience and the expedition of those legions which had subjugated so many nations these roads of which some still remain were high broad solid and in several places branched out into great squares which the subverting hand of time seems yet to respect our roads on the contrary are in a variety of places in so pitiful a condition that three or four days of rain frequently interrupt the intercourse of commerce and delay the journeys of the best equipages  all this is lamentably true we need blush at the romans possessing more magnificent roads than ourselves we who emulate them in all the ruin of the luxury besides they never paid so much turnpikemoney as we do  light summer showers forming burning mirrors in the summer after some days of fine weather during the heat of the day if a storm happens accompanied with a few light showers of rain and if the sun appears immediately after with all it is usual ardour it burns the foliage and the flowers on which the rain had fallen and destroys the hopes of the orchard the burning heat which the ardour of the sun produces at that time on the leaves and flowers is equal to the intense heat of burning iron naturalists have sought for the cause of this strange effect but they have said nothing which satisfies a reasonable mind this is however the fact in the serene days of the summer it is visible that there gathers on the foliage and the flowers as indeed on every other part a little dust sometimes more and sometimes less scattered by the wind when the rain falls on this dust the drops mix together and take an oval or round form as we may frequently observe in our houses on the dusty floor or cieling when they scatter water before they sweep them it is thus these globes of water mingled on the foliage form so many of those unequal glasses which we call burning mirrors and which produce the same effect should the rain be heavy and last long the sun would not then produce this burning heat because the force and the duration of the rain will have destroyed the dust which formed these drops of water and these drops losing their globular form in which alone consisted their caustic power will be dispersed without any extraordinary effect for this observation which to the naturalist must appear curious and novel he is indebted to the ingenious huet bishop of avranches  bleeding and evacuation two remedies for love huet has a very singular observation on love which he exemplifies by an anecdote as singular  love he says is not merely a passion of the soul but it is also a disease of the body like the fever it is frequently in the blood and in the mind which are terribly agitated and to be cured it may be treated as methodically as any other disorder great perspirations and copious bleedings that carry away with the humor the inflammable spirits would purge the blood calm the emotions and replace every part in it is natural state  the great conde having felt a violent passion for mademoiselle de vigean was constrained to join the army while his absence lasted his passion was continually nourished by the tenderest recollections of love and by an intercourse of a continued correspondence till the conclusion of the campaign when a dangerous sickness brought him to the most imminent danger to the violence of his illness violent remedies were applied and every thing that was most efficacious in physic was given to the prince he regained his health but he had lost his love the great evacuations had carried away his passion and when he thought himself a lover he found he had ceased to love  on this anecdote it is to be observed that the fact is well authenticated and however the reader may feel himself inclined to turn wit on this occasion it is veracity cannot in the least be injured but it must be confessed that evacuations may not always have on a despairing lover the same happy effect when we would explain the mechanism of the human passions observes an ingenious writer the observations must be multiplied this fact then does not tend to show that the same remedies will cure every lover but that they did cure the prince de conde  there is however another species of evacuation not less efficacious for a despairing swain which will probably amuse the reader  a german gentleman burned with an amorous flame for a german princess she was not insensible to a reciprocal passion and to have him about her person without giving scandal she created him her general they lived some time much pleased with each other but the princess became sickle and the general grew jealous he made very sharp remonstrances and the princess who wished to be free gave him his conge and he was constrained to quit her but his passion at every hour increased he found he could not live out of her presence and he ventured to enter imperceptibly into her cabinet there he threw himself at her feet and entreated her forgiveness the princess frowned and condescended to give no other answer than a command to withdraw from her royal highnesss presence the despairing lover exclaimed that he was ready to obey her in every thing but that that he was resolved in this to disobey her and that he preferred to die by her hand in saying this to give force to his eloquence he presented his naked sword to the german princess who perhaps being little acquainted with the flowers of rhetoric most cruelly took him at his word and run him through the body fortunately the wound did not prove mortal he was healed of his wound at the end of three months and likewise of his passion which had flowed away with the effusion of blood  infectious diseases the present article from the learned bishop of avranches if not a valuable forms at least an ingenious speculation  neither naturalists or physicians have informed us what is the cause which renders contagious so many diseases while others are not in the least infectious the gout the gravel the epilepsy the apoplexy are not caught by frequenting the company of the diseased but the plague the dysentery the itch the bloody flux occasion frequently terrible ravages by their infection this is very probably the fact it may be said in general that all contagious diseases produce worms which are contained in ulcers pustules or pimples either internal or external some less and some more and of different kinds we shall not here examine the cause of the productions of these worms but their effect is common and unvaried and sometimes visible it is also well known that these worms by undergoing a revolution which in them is natural change into the fly state and become gnats this is done in a short time and in infinite numbers as soon as these flies imperceptible by their diminutive size can lift themselves by their wings they take their flight they are there scattered abroad and entering the bodies of men by respiration they infuse that poison by which they are engendered and communicate that corruption from whence they have sprung  it is thus great fires have been found very serviceable in public contagions kindled in diverse places they have as many imagine purified the air the air is indeed purified but not in the manner generally supposed by rarifying and changing it is composition but in burning and consuming these flying gnats with which the air is filled and which attracted by the light of the flames mix with them and are destroyed in the same manner as moths are by a candle an opposite cause produces also the same effect i mean a sharp frost that kills and destroys these terrible insects if not entirely at least the greater part for it has been known that so great have been their numbers that many have escaped the rigours of the frost and have continued the infection as it happened some centuries back in the dreadful plague which desolated denmark and the neighboring countries  genealogy welsh genealogies have long been a standing jest who does not know their partiality to cadwallader yet there are others which can disturb the muscles of the gravest philosopher and perhaps make the most ingenious herald smile at his own ingenuity charles the fifth and louis the thirteenth have caused their genealogies to reach to adam de crouy who married the heiress of the de crouys in the time of saint louis because he came from hungary resolved if he brought nothing at least to bring a genealogy and ventured to trace his descent from attila king of the huns who it must be allowed is a more regal ancestor than adam himself  ambergris ambergris is nothing else than honey which abounds in the extensive mountains of the side of ajan melted by the heat of the sun and which falling into the sea is condensed or petrified by the coldness of the water the proof is that very frequently bees are found enclosed in morsels of ambergris this opinion is ingenious it is given by the abbe longuerue but the opinions of what ambergris is composed are so various that the fact is we are ignorant of it  pious frauds the abbey of signi in champagne was uncommonly rich and extensive but at this we must not be astonished saint bernard had promised those who assisted to found it as much  spatium or place in heaven as they gave land to his order of citeaux the good people of those days had more faith in saints than their graceless posterity and had the magistrates not restrained their pious zeal this abbey would have occupied a whole province  so also when pope urban had to combat with clement the seventh he was obliged to have recourse to the scheme of saint bernard this is not wonderful but it is wonderful that as soon as he published a bull promising a plenary remission of their sins and a place in paradise to all who fought in his cause or contributed money to support it our own nation flew up in arms and as an old historian observes  as soon as these bulls were published in england the whole people were transported with joy and thought that the opportunity of obtaining such inestimable graces was not to be neglected the representative of saint peter can no more issue such roaring bulls tempora mutantur  chinese physicians the physicians of china by feeling the arms of a sick man in three places to observe the slowness the increase or quickness of the pulse can judge of the cause the nature the danger and the duration of his disorder without their patients speaking they reveal infallibly what part is affected they are at once doctors and apothecaries composing the remedies they prescribe they are paid when they have completed a cure but they receive nothing when their remedies do not take effect our physicians it must be confessed are by no means so skilful as the chinese but in one thing they have the advantage over them which is in taking their fees before they have performed the cure and it is thus that physicians with little or no learning ride in their chariots in london while in pekin they are very learned and walk on foot  female beauty and ornaments the ladies in japan gild their teeth and those of the indies paint them red the blackest teeth are esteemed the most beautiful in guzurat and in some parts of america in greenland the women color their faces with blue and yellow however fresh the complexion of a muscovite may be she would think herself very ugly if she was not plaistered over with paint the chinese must have their feet as diminutive as those of the shegoats and to render them thus their youth is passed in tortures in ancient persia and aquiline nose was often thought worthy of the crown and if there was any competition between two princes the people generally went by this criterion of majesty in some countries the mothers break the noses of their children and in others press the head between two boards that it may become square the modern persians have a strong aversion to red hair the turks on the contrary are warm admirers of these disgusting locks the indian beauty is thickly smeared with bears fat and the female hottentot receives from the hand of her lover not silks or wreaths of flowers but warm guts and reeking tripe to dress herself with enviable ornaments  at china small eyes are liked and the girls are continually plucking their eyebrows that they may be small and long the turkish women dip a gold brush in the tincture of a black drug which they pass over their eyebrows it is too visible by day but looks shining by night they tinge their nails with a rosecolour  an ornament for the nose appears to us perfectly unnecessary the peruvians however think otherwise and they hand on it a weighty ring the thickness of which is proportioned by the rank of their husbands the custom of boring it as our ladies do their ears is very common in several nations through the perforation are hung various materials such as green crystal gold stones a single and sometimes a great number of gold rings this is rather troublesome to them in blowing their noses and the fact is some have informed us that the indian ladies never perform this very useful operation  the female headdress is carried in some countries to singular extravagance the chinese fair carries on her head the figure of a certain bird this bird is composed of copper or of gold according to the quality of the person the wings spread out fall over the front of the headdress and conceal the temples the tail long and open forms a beautiful tuft of feathers the beak covers the top of the nose the neck is fastened to the body of the artificial animal by a spring that it may the more freely play and tremble at the slightest motion  the extravagance of the myantses is far more ridiculous than the above they carry on their heads a slight board rather longer than a foot and about six inches broad with this they cover their hair and seal it with wax they cannot lie down nor lean without keeping the neck very straight and the country being very woody it is not uncommon to find them with their headdress entangled in the trees whenever they comb their hair they pass an hour by the fire in melting the wax but this combing is only performed once or twice a year  to this curious account extracted from duhalde we must join that of the inhabitants of the land of natal they wear caps or bonnets from six to ten inches high composed of the fat of oxen they then gradually anoint the head with a purer grease which mixing with the hair fastens these bonnets for their lives  the wooden daughter of descartes when descartes resided in holland with great labor and industry he made a female automation  which occasioned some wicked wits to publish that he had an illegitimate daughter named franchine  to prove demonstratively that beasts have no souls and that they are but machines nicely composed and move whenever another body strikes them and communicates to them a portion of their motions having put this singular machine into a case on board a vessel the dutch captain who sometimes heard it move had the curiosity to open the box astonished to see a little human form extremely animated yet when touched appearing to be nothing but wood little versed in science but greatly addicted to superstition he took the ingenious labor of the philosopher for a little devil and terminated the experiment of descartes by throwing his wooden daughter into the sea  a travellers singularities balthazar gratian author of the courtier has frequently very singular strokes of imagination in one of his works he supposes his hero to travel in search of a true friend among the most singular curiosities he meets with in his travels are to be distinguished the following ones  a poor judge with his wife neither of whom had any fingers to their hands a great lord without any debts a prince who was never offended at the truth being told him to his face a poet who became rich by the produce of his works a monarch who died without any suspicion of having been poisoned a humble spaniard a silent frenchman a lively englishman a german who disliked wine a learned man recompensed a chaste widow a madman discontented a sincere female and what was more singular than all these singularities a true friend  a heavy heart this is a vulgar phrase and it will be found like the generality of vulgar phrases which have long been current not destitute of signification according to many eminent physicians timid men have the heart very thick and heavy rioland relates that he has sometimes met with the hearts of persons of this description which have weighed from two to three pounds amongst these was that of mary de medicis which was nearly of the latter weight it is probable that the afflictions and the griefs of this unfortunate princess did not a little contribute to thicken and render  her heart heavy  pasquin and marforio all the world have heard of these statues they have served as vehicles for the keenest satire in a land of the greatest despotism the statue of pasquin from whence the word pasquinade and that of marforio are placed in rome in two different quarters marforios is a statue that lies at it is whole length it represents according to some panarium jovum and according to others the river rhine or the nar that of pasquin is a marble statue greatly mutilated which stands at the corner of the palace of the ursinos and it is supposed to be the figure of a gladiator whatever they may have been is now of little consequence it is certain that to one or other of these statues are affixed during the concealment of the night those satires or lampoons which the authors wish should be dispersed about rome without any danger to themselves when marforio is attacked pasquin comes to his succor and when pasquin is the sufferer he finds in marforio a constant defender it is thus with a thrust and a parry the most serious matters are disclosed and the most illustrious personages are attacked by their enemies and defended by their friends  music naturalists pretend that animals and birds as well as knotted oaks as congreve informs us are exquisitely sensible to the charms of music this may serve as an instance an officer having spoken somewhat too free of the minister louvois was  as once was the custom  immediately consigned to the bastile he begged the governor to permit him the use of his lute to soften by the harmonies of his instrument the rigours of his prison at the end of a few days this modern orpheus playing on his lute was greatly astonished to see frisking out of their holes great numbers of mice and descending from their woven habitations crowds of spiders who formed a circle about him while he continued breathing his soulsubduing instrument his surpize was at first so great that he was petrified with astonishment when having ceased to play the assembly who did not come to see his person but to hear his instrument immediately broke up as he had a great dislike to spiders it was two days before he ventured again to touch his instrument at length having conquered for the novelty of his company his dislike of them he recommenced his concert when the assembly was by far more numerous than at first and in the course of farther time he found himself surrounded by a hundred musical amateurs having thus succeeded in attracting this company he treacherously contrived to get rid of them at his will for this purpose he begged the keeper to give him a cat which he put in a cage and let loose at the very instant when the little hairy people were most entranced by the orphean skill be displayed  locusts the locusts so frequently mentioned in the scriptures and in many ancient authors are a species of grasshoppers that have nothing in them disgustful the parthians the ethiopians and the arabs found them delicious food after causing them to fall from the trees by means of smoke ascending from fires kindled at their feet they salted dried them in the sun and preserved them for food throughout the year saint john the baptist ate them with wild honey according to the custom of the poor of those times they appear sometimes in asia and in africa in such prodigious numbers that they darken the air and consume in an instant the fruits and herbage of a whole country the heaps of those which die infect the air and occasion a contagion it is probable that these phenomena are the harpies of the ancients which even came to devour the meats on the table of the king of bythinia and if we add that calais and zethus the children of boreas chased them from this country and pursued them to the isles of strophades which are in the ionian sea where they caused them to perish all this fiction may be understood thus  that the northern winds had blown them into this sea and it is true that nothing so certainly delivers a country which is infected with these insects as a strong wind that carries them off to the sea where they infallibly must perish on this head the reader may consult goldsmith  antimoine or antimony coffee and jesuits bark the origin of antimony is a remarkable circumstance basil valentin superior of a college of religionists having observed that this mineral fattened the pigs imagined that it would produce the same effect on the holy brotherhood but the case was seriously different the unfortunate fathers who greedily made use of it died in a very short time this is the origin of it is name which i have written according to the pure french word in spite of this unfortunate beginning paracelsus resolved to bring this mineral into practice he thought he could make it useful by mixing it with other preparations but he did not succeed according to his hopes the faculty at paris were on this occasion divided into two parties the one maintained that antimony was a poison the other affirmed that it was an excellent remedy the dispute became more general and the parliament and the sorbonne interfered in the matter but some time afterward the world began to judge rightly concerning this excellent mineral and it is wonderful effects have occasioned the faculty to place it among their best remedies  the use of coffee is said to have a similar origin that however was never attended with such dreadful effects a prior of a monastery in the part of arabia where this berry grows having remarked that the goats who eat of it became extremely brisk and alert resolved to try the experiment on his monks of whom he so continually complained for their lethargic propensities the experiment turned out successful and it is said it was owing to this circumstance that the use of this arabian berry came to be so universal  a casual circumstance discovered that excellent febrifuge the jesuits bark an indian in a delirious fever having been left by his companions by the side of a river as incurable to quench his burning thirst he naturally drank copious draughts of the water which having long imbibed the virtues of the bark which abundantly floated on the stream it quickly dispersed the fever of the indian he returned to his friends and having explained the nature of his remedy the indisposed crowded about the margin of the holy stream as they imagined it to be till they perfectly exhausted all it is virtues the sages of the tribe however found at length in what consisted the efficacy of the stream the americans discovered it in the year    0 to the lady of the viceroy of peru who recovered by it is use from a dangerous fever in      the reputation of this remedy was spread about spain italy and rome by the cardinal de lugo and other jesuits and thus like the antimony it is name is significant of it is origin  babylon thebes and nineveh of the situation of these three greatest cities in the universe of which history presents us with so many wonderful accounts we are ignorant there does not remain the slightest vestige the hundred gates of thebes the hanging gardens and innumerable streets of babylon nineveh to use the expressions of scripture that great city in which were more than six score thousand persons are all melted away like the baseless fabric of a vision  solomon and sheba i recollect a pretty story which in the talmud of gemara some rabbin has attributed to solomon  the power of this monarch had spread his wisdom to the remotest parts of the known world a private scholar in general passes his life in obscurity and posterity  a solitary consolation  spreads his name to the most distant regions but when a king is a student the case is reversed queen sheba attracted by the splendor of his reputation or more probably urged by the insatiable curiosity of the female visited this poetical king at his own court with the sole intention of asking him questions the rabbin cannot inform me if her examination of the monarch was always made in the chamber of audience there is reason to suspect that they frequently retired for the solution of many a hard problem to the philosophic solitude of a private cabinet but i do not intend by any means to make this work as my lord lyttleton answered to a curious female concerning his history a vehicle for antiquated scandal  it is sufficient that the incident i now relate passed as solomon sat surrounded by his court at the foot of the throne stood the inquisitive sheba in each hand she held a wreath of flowers the one composed of natural the other of artificial flowers art in the labor of the mimic wreath had exquisitely emulated the lively hues and the variegated beauties of nature so that at the distance it was held by the queen for the inspection of the king it was deemed impossible for him to decide  as her question imported  which wreath was the natural and which the artificial the sagacious solomon seemed posed yet to be vanquished though in a trifle by a trifling woman irritated his pride the son of david  he who had written treatises on the vegetable productions from the cedar to the hyssop to acknowledge himself outwitted by a woman with shreds of papers and glazed paintings the honor of the monarchs reputation for divine sagacity seemed diminished and the whole jewish court looked solemn and melancholy at length an expedient presented itself to the king and it must be confessed worthy of the natural philosopher observing a cluster of bees hovering about a window he commanded that it should be opened it was opened the bees rushed into court and alighted immediately on one of the wreaths while not a single one fixed on the other the decision was not then difficult the learned rabbis shook their beards in rapture and the baffled sheba had one more reason to be astonished at the wisdom of solomon  this would make a pretty poetical tale it would yield an elegant description and a pleasing moral that the be only rests on the natural beauties and never fixes on the painted flowers however inimitable the colors may be laid on this applied to the ladies would give it pungency  poets reciting their works in public it was anciently the custom in rome when a poet had composed a poem to rehearse it before a public audience that he might gather from them their sentiments and receive their applause or their censure juvenal opens his satires with a bitter preliminary concerning this manner of recitation which indeed must have been intolerable when like the endless epic of orestes it foamed over the very margins and covers  strabo tells us that a poet one day was reading in a public place to an audience who listened to him with attention during his recitation a bell rung which was usual when the market was going to be held in the twinkling of the poets eye he beheld himself deserted by all his auditors except one person who being very deaf had not heard the bell the poet imagining him to be a man who possessed a correct taste and for this reason remained there to hear the last verse of his poem began to compliment him highly i cannot but be sensible exclaimed the poet to your judicious manner of treating me while the others have flown off at the first ringing of the marketbell you remain  favorite of apollo  to the conclusion of my poem  what interrupted the other hastily have they rung the bell for the market and have i been losing all this time in listening to verses adieu adieu and went to rejoin the rest of the poets auditors in the marketplace  how the bells of the church steeple advise about marriage the story which rabelais so pleasantly has given in the seventh chapter of his third book and the answer of pantagruel to panurge concerning his intention of marrying menage observes is copied from a latin sermon on widowhood by a monk of cluny the original passage has sufficient humor to induce me to transcribe it   a certain widow who felt a very strong inclination toward the holy bond of matrimony thought it most decent to take the advice of the curate of her parish who passed for what is called a very goodnatured soul because he was disposed to let every one act as they thought proper i am said she a poor unhappy woman who has lost the best husband in the world my apprentice knows all the ways of his old master i have often thought i should do well to marry this young man but i wish to take your advice the curate immediately answered that she had then better take him ah but i have my fears rejoined the widow when a servant becomes a master it is dangerous the curate approved of this sentiment and advised her not to marry him but what shall i do exclaimed the widow i cannot proceed in the business my late husband left unless i find another  true the curate replied you will then do well to marry him  very well she answered but if he happens to turn out bad he may ruin me  very just replied the curate you must not marry him then it was in vain the goodnatured ecclesiastic to get rid of her importunities always agreed with her sentiments he observed her inclinations for the apprentice and at length he found this expedient to terminate her objections go madam and take advice of the bells of the steeple when they ring they will tell you what you should do when the bells rung the widow attentively listened and according to her wishes she heard distinctly  prens ton valet prens ton valet upon these strong arguments in favor of the young man she married him scarce had the honeymoon closed when she received very cruel treatment from her late apprentice and she who was mistress now became a servant she went to complain to the goodnatured curate of the advice he gave her cursing the apocryphal bells of the church and her fond credulity he told her that she had misunderstood the bells  observe them next time the widow again listened and very clearly distinguished the sounds of  ne le prens pas ne le prens pas for the blows and the cruel treatment which she had received had dissipated her passion and the truth is that all the advice of the bells consisted in her own inclinations agreeably to our old english couplet  as the fool thinks so the bell tinketh   the three racans the present anecdote to it is merit as an humorous deception may add that of being a fact  when mademoiselle de gournay arrived at paris she desired to see the marquis of racan an eminent wit and poet two of racans friends knew the time they had appointed for his waiting on her and they resolved to be revenged on racan for many a ridiculous situation to which he had exposed them one of these gentlemen about two hours before the time appointed waited on mademoiselle de gournay and announced himself as racan he endeavored to talk with the lady about her own works which he had purposely turned over the night before and though he did not perfectly satisfy mademoiselle de gournay in point of his abilities besides committing some gross blunders she could not however but think the marquis was a very polite gentleman he had scarce parted from her when another marquis de racan was announced she naturally supposed that it was the first who had forgotten to say something to her and returned for this purpose when to her great surprise another stranger entered she could not help questioning him repeatedly if he was the real marquis de racan and informed him of what had just passed the pretended racan appeared very much hurt and declared that he would be revenged of the insult the stranger had mutually offered them but to cut the matter short mademoiselle de gournay softened the choleric man and was infinitely pleased with the second marquis de racan who exceeded the first in every respect scarce had this second counterfeit racan issued when the real racan was announced this began to exercise the patience of mademoiselle de gournay what more racans in one morning she exclaimed however she resolved to see the third as soon as he entered she raised her voice and asked him if he meant to insult her racan who at the best was but an indifferent speaker remained silent with astonishment he muttered something and mademoiselle de gournay who was naturally violent and irascible imagined that he was sent to impose upon her she pulled off her slipper and fell upon the real and unfortunate racan with the rage of an irritated virago and made him gladly retreat from a visit where he had expected to meet with a very different reception  the excellent preacher a young preacher who had a very handsome mien a melodious voice a graceful action and all the other agreeable charms which please in declamation having mounted the pulpit suddenly lost his memory and not a word of the sermon could he recollect to quit the pulpit would have been dishonorable to speak was more difficult for he had nothing to say what was to be done in this extremity he resolved to remain collected and to make the best use of his voice and action without pronouncing any thing but unconnected words imperfect sentences and pathetic exclamations such as fors buts ifs yets ohs ahs you will please to observe etc never did a preacher appear with more grace and animation he expanded his lungs he made pathetic exclamations and waved his hand in a thousand graceful manners the pulpit shook and the vault of the church which was vast reechoed to all the vociferations he sent forth the audience preserved a profound silence every one inclined his ear and redoubled his attention to catch sentences which were never spoken those who sat near the pulpit said  we are too near we cannot hear a sentence those who sat remote complained of the distance which caused them to lose the most wonderful sermon they ever heard in a word our preacher kept his auditors in this manner for three quarters of an hour all of them complaining of their seats when he withdrew their acclamations followed him and they resolved the next time he preached to choose their places with more care and not to deprive themselves of the fruits of a sermon which they were sensible was never equalled  this anecdote will show that a preacher may succeed without reason or imagination and if we judge by some who enjoy a good reputation it will tend to prove that a musical voice balancing the hands and uttering warm exclamations are the chief requisites for a declaimer in the pulpit  the venetian horseman a horse in venice or a tree in scotland i think johnson observed were singularities a venetian who was more accustomed to a gondola than to a horse being for the first time mounted and as it not infrequently happens to young riders having the misfortune to be furnished with one that was restiff could not possibly make his nag advance a single step unable to account for the animals retrograde activity he at length took out his handkerchief and holding it in the air he exclaimed in a tone of exultation  ah poor horse no wonder thou could not get forward per che il vento e contrario for the wind i see is contrary  the porridgepot of the cordeliers there are few at paris who know why they speak so much concerning the great porridgepot of the cordeliers of the great convent it is in fact a singular piece it can contain from five to six hundred pounds of meat and near two tuns of water so that it is no trifling occupation with those good fathers to make a soup this deep pot broad and high in proportion to it is depth does not admit of any thing being put in or drawn out without ascending a ladder a gluttonous cordelier always took the opportunity when the cooks were gone to church to repair there and steal some delicious bit from this enormous pot he drew it up with an iron fork and conveyed it to his cell to regale himself with two or three others of his comrades who had the secret of conveying wine from the cellar  this monk having one day mounted the ladder to draw as usual some delicate morsel from the pot which then happened to be not more than twothirds full he was obliged to stretch himself to an unusual degree and the fork by the ponderous weight of the piece he had greedily stuck it into slipped from his hands he did his best to extricate it but overturned by his own weight and eagerness he tumbled into the pot and was soon suffocated without any power of assistance in the boiling lake of broth a few hours afterward the cooks came to serve the refectory all the broth was emptied the basins were filled and brought to their usual places for the use of the religionists they then returned to bring the meat from the pot but how great was their surprise when on ascending the ladder the first piece that presented itself was the unfortunate cordelier quite entire with great labor they hauled him out the prior who was privately informed of this singular incident thought proper to have him conveyed to his bed they then gave out that he died suddenly the world for some time believed it but the cooks could not keep the secret  great painters i imagine that when our cosways visit each other if it happens that their friend is not at home they are incapable by the perfection of their art to leave any peculiar beauties behind them of which a connoisseur could say  certainly cosway has been here today for who but cosway could express this line or infuse this grace  the ancient apelles on a visit to a brother artist acted in this manner  he went purposely to rhodes to see protogenes when he arrived at the painters house he found him absent but observing on his easel an unfinished picture he snatched a brush and drew a line exquisitely delicate when the slave asked him to leave his name he answered  your master will know who i am when he sees his picture the slave on his masters return informed him of what had passed protogenes examining the line exclaimed  this must be by the hand of apelles he is certainly at rhodes he took up the brush and drew another line still more delicate than the former and instructed the slave when the stranger should return only to show him that line apelles returned and blushing he beheld himself surpassed but what did he do he took the brush and divided the line of protogenes into two parts by a third which it was impossible a fourth could divide protogenes when he examined it exclaimed  now do i know for certain that apelles is at rhodes he went to the ship and acknowledging himself vanquished led his beloved friend and rival to his house  raphael painted a man who was in a high fever with so much skill and so perfect a resemblance that a physician who never passed for a connoisseur at the first sight of the portrait declared that the original must have been in a dangerous fever  french and spaniards a little work published after that famous intermarriage which overcame the enmity of the two courts of france and spain though it could not that of the two nations presents us with a humorous contrast of their manners dispositions habits etc   a frenchman says our author entering his friends house will immediately ask for some refreshment a spaniard would rather perish with hunger or thirst a frenchman salutes a lady by kissing her a spaniard on presenting a lady his hand will cover it with his cloak and retreat back several paces to bow to her at a hundred steps distant   i have often been tempted says the author who was a spaniard to ask the midwives if it was possible that a french child could be brought into the world in the same manner as a spanish infant  so dissimilar they prove from their birth   the french have a lively apprehension hating idleness and reducing their knowledge into practical use but they do not penetrate deeply into any matter the spaniard on the contrary is fond of abstract and abstruse speculation and dwells continually on an object the french are afraid of believing too much the other of believing too little the former will dispatch the weightiest business in the midst of noise and tumult amidst the levity of assemblies or gaieties of the table whilst the grave spaniard cannot bear the buzzing of a fly to disturb his fixed attention in love the one are light and talkative the other constant and secret the spaniard will disguise his poverty under a thousand pretenses and invent as many fictions to persuade you his appearance is owing to the necessity of concealing his person whilst the frenchman will press his wants upon you with the most persevering importunity in every minutia this difference is traced both at the toilette and table in mixing wine the spaniard puts the water first in the glass whilst the frenchman puts the wine first a troop of frenchmen will walk abreast in the street with abundance of tattle whilst the spaniards will walk with measured gravity in a defile like a procession a frenchman discovering a person at a distance beckons with an uplifted hand drawn toward his face the spaniard bends his hands downwards and moves it toward his feet  this contrast of humors and manners he seems inclined to attribute to the difference of climate in the one country settled and constant in the other ever varying as the genius of it is inhabitants  animals imitate language and action sir william temple in his memoirs relates a story concerning an old parrot belonging to the prince maurice that readily answered to several questions promiscuously put to it however singular the fact may appear he assures us it was told him as such by the prince himself  scaliger tells us that he saw a crow in the french kings court that was taught to fly at partridges or any other fowl from the falconers hand  cardinal assanio had a parrot that was taught to repeat the apostles creed verbatim in latin and in the court of spain there was one that could sing the gamut perfectly  in the roman history an anecdote is recorded the truth of which we have no reason to doubt when the sovereignty of the world was depending between caesar and antony a poor man at rome bred up two crows and taught them to pronounce in their prattling language a salutation to the emperor and that he might be provided against all events one of them saluted caesar and the other antony when augustus was returning as the conqueror this man with the crow on his hand met him and it was an ingenious and agreeable flattery to which augustus was not insensible to be saluted by a crow with the acclamations of victory he rewarded the novel adulator munificently the neighbor of the man however having in vain essayed to teach the same language to two crows he had destined for this purpose stung with envy at his happier fate revealed to augustus that this man had another crow at his house which he had intended to have saluted antony had fortune favored his party this malicious intelligence intercepted the bounty of augustus  perhaps nothing appears more wonderful than the sight of an unwieldy elephant dancing the manner of teaching this grave animal so ludicrous an action is thus cruelly practiced  they bring a young elephant upon an iron floor heated underneath and play on a musical instrument while he lifts up his legs and shifts his feet about by reason of the torture of the heat this frequently repeated occasions him to dance at the least sound of music  but let us not suppose that animals that thus imitate the actions and language of rational creatures possess therefore in some degree rationality and mental intelligence for when an elephant for instance dances to music it is not from any principles of reason but from the concatenation of the two ideas of heat and music to which custom has habituated him so a parrot may answer any question it is accustomed to hear but this action needs not the aid of reason since it may be effected by an habitual idea of things even the inferior ranks of animals receive their ideas by the senses such and such sounds often repeated and such and such actions immediately preceding or immediately following those sounds must necessarily form a complex idea both of the sound and action so that when either such action or such sound is repeated an idea of the other must necessarily attend it thus dogs are taught to fetch and carry and parrots speak more words than one together these words poor poll for instance being often repeated together if one be mentioned and the other left there must necessarily be an idea of the other sound because custom and habit link them together as two words are taught so may three and if three why not many it is thus by a complex idea the elephant dances for when he hears music the idea of the heated floor occasions him to dance  the arguments here alleged for the power which some animals show in imitating our speech and actions are chiefly drawn from an old athenian mercury  attic pleasantries the bishop of belley was a great wit and very happy in extemporaneous effusions but his wit bears too frequently the alloy of puns and clenches the

religious matters for which he was imprisoned and not having kept his promise of turning a good catholic he was condemned to be burnt as an atheist in paris on the third of august      as he proceeded to the place of execution he observed the people commiserate his fate on which he made this verse  non dolet ipse dolet sed pia turba dolet the doctor who accompanied him answered  non pia turba dolet

portrait in that work  oui par toi de satan la puissance est bridee mais tu nas cependant pas encore asses fait pour nous oter de diable entierement lidee becker supprime ton portrait   noah and saturn there can be no doubt that noah was the pagan saturn noah was a just man in his days he endeavored to enlighten the wicked race amongst whom he lived by his counsels and to instruct them by his example thus according to aurelius victor and diodorus saturn softened the wicked inclinations of men and endeavored to bring them back to their ancient purity of manners by a civilized and regulated life  between the deluge and the birth of phaleg there was an interval of one hundred years when the world not being yet shared out noah had a natural right to be the sovereign of his children this is the golden age the poets so much celebrate where every thing was in common  moses calls noah isch  hadama  that is the man of the earth  for labourer  the mythologists who accommodated their fables to history observing that the hebrew word bore two significations either man or husband say that rhea or the earth was the wife of saturn and as the man of the earth also relates to agriculture they attribute to saturn the art of cultivating fields vines and meadows representing him with a scythe in his hands  from the passage in genesis where it is said noah was intoxicated with the liquor of the vines he had planted they have said also that saturn presided over ebriety hence they called that day in the year in which the masters attended their slaves the saturnalian feast  plato says in his timaeus that saturn rhea and their family were born of the ocean and thetis which corresponds with noah and his family coming from the waters of the deluge  saturn had for successors his three children jupiter neptune and pluto and noah shared out the earth to his three sons shem ham and japheth this last who is neptune had for his portion all the isles and peninsulas of the sea  moses says that god consecrated to himself a church in the family of shem and as he must have been the greatest enemy of the idolaters it is very probable that hating him they made him pluto who is the god of hell and the dead  cham or ham had for his portion africa arabia and egypt which after his name was anciently called chemie where he was adored during many ages under the name of jupiter ham hammon etc and why the pagans said of jupiter that he cut those parts of his father saturn which it is not allowed to name comes from this passage of the ninth chapter of genesis being misunderstood  quod cum videret cham pater canaan verenda patris sui esse nudata nunnavit this last word is in the hebrew vajagged and perhaps the vowel points not being marked occasioned them to read vejagod which signifies cut  the whole of this article which displays much ingenious erudition is drawn from the chevraeana vol i p     metempsichosis if we seek for the origin of the opinion of the metempsichosis or the transmigration of souls into other bodies we must plunge into the remotest antiquity and even then we shall find it impossible to fix the epoch of it is first author we know that the notion was long extant in greece before the time of pythagoras herodotus assures us that the egyptian priests taught it but he does not inform us about the time it began to be spread it is very probable it followed the opinion of the immortality of the soul as soon as the first philosophers had established this dogma they thought they could not maintain this immortality without a transmigration of souls the opinion of the metempsichosis spread in almost every region of the earth and it continues even to the present time in all it is force amongst those nations who have not yet embraced christianity the people of arracan pegu siam camboya tonquin cochinchina japan java and ceylon are still in that error which also forms the chief article of the chinese religion  the mother tongues scaliger observes there are four mother or radical tongues in europe theos the greek deus the latin the french the italian and the spanish got the danish the english the german the dutch and the flemish goii the sclavonian there are six lesser or inferior languages independent of the above four the bask the low breton the hungarian the irish the swedish and the tartarian the welsh language must also be distinguished though it bears so great an affinity to the low breton that it is said these nations understand each other with little difficulty the irish and the danes once spoke the same language the bask is the ancient spanish as the cantabrians spoke it in the time of the romans  the latin tongue the fate of the latin tongue may be divided into six ages the barbarous and uncultivated age the middle age the golden the silver the brass and the iron ages  the barbarous age lasted from four to five hundred years from romulus in whose reign more greek than latin was spoken till livius andronicus the first who caused plays to be acted at rome  the middle age extends itself from andronicus till the days of cicero during this interval of time many authors began to write the latin language the most distinguished are ennius naevius plautus terence and lucretius the poem of the last writer does so much honor to this age that we must heartily acknowledge it would not be unworthy even of the golden age of pure latinity were it somewhat less obscure  the golden age of the latin language began in the reign of circero and finished with the reign of augustus so that without a metaphor it is but an age then flourished varro cicero julius caesar cornelius nepos virgil horace ovid severus albinovanus sallust and others a part of whose works have happily escaped the ravages of time  the silver age which commences at the death of augustus and terminates with antonine the pious was very fruitful in excellent compositions but it is language began to lose somewhat of it is richness and it is purity in spite of the indefatigable quintilian who vainly attempted to revive the golden age seneca whose style is one continued affectation who is for ever on the stretch to catch points antithesis and other trivial sports of the mind enervates manly sentiment and shocks a correct taste it was him who corrupted the latin language  the age of brass commences from the reign of antonine and reaches till honorius under whose reign the invasions of the barbarians took place besides profane authors who abound in this age it produced tertullian arnobius lactantius cyprian saint hilary prudentius ambrose jerome augustine damases and sulpicius severus  the irruptions of the barbarians occasioned an age of iron to the latin language who has not heard declamations against the goths and vandals this dreadful epoch lasted from six to seven ages during this time some authors however arose who have done honor to the latin tongue but it must be recollected that the ignorance of these times was so deplorable that our great alfred complains that in england it was difficult to find a priest who could read and the historian of universal history must record that the knowledge of the ecclesiastics consisted only in some very barbarous latin  aldensis manutius composed the first latin grammar it was printed at paris in   00 the method of the port royal is the first which freed itself from the bondage of prescribing rules in latin to learn the latin language  the latin language is ranked amongst those they call dead because they are no more the languages the vulgar of any nation speak and being regulated by the ancient authors custom can no more tyrannize over them but it may be said in a figurative sense that they are living ones by the constant use the learned make of them and it may not be improper to call them the languages of the land of science  the english language i have extracted from two authors of a distant interval of time  since one is honest peter heylin who wrote in the days of our first charles and the other mr sheridan whose lectures are well known  the present article concerning that language which it becomes us not so much to enlarge as to preserve  peter heylin thus observes in his cosmography  the english language is a decompound of dutch french and latin which i conceive rather to add to it is perfection than to detract any thing from the worth thereof since out of every language we have culled the most significant words and equally participate in that which is excellent in them their imperfections being rejected for it is neither so boisterous as the dutch nor so effeminate as the french yet as significant as the latin and in the happy conjunction of two words into one little inferior of the greek  mr sheridan thus ingeniously has written on the same topic  upon a fair comparison it will appear that the french have emasculated their tongue by rejecting such numbers of their consonants and made it resemble one of their painted courtezans adorned with fripperies and fallals that the german by abounding too much in harsh consonants and gutturals has great size and strength like the statue of hercules farnese but no grace that the roman like the bust of antinous is beautiful indeed but not manly that the italian has beauty grace and symmetry like the venus of medicis but is feminine and that the english alone resembles the ancient greek in uniting the three powers of strength beauty and grace like the apollo of belvedere  i contemplate with great pleasure the classical statue which is here offered to the imagination when i recollect the sweetness of addison the strength of johnson and the grace of melmoth i rise into enthusiasm and exult in the conviction that the english is the most perfect of the european languages the embarrassed periods of hooker raleigh and clarendon will no more languish on the ear we have polished the solid marble of our ancestors with strength to which we have no pretensions they have extracted it from the quarry but we are the artificers who with the dexterous use of the file can smooth their asperities can arrange into elegance and can heighten into luster no more shall some future waller sing that he who employs the english language writes his verses on sand and that to endure to posterity he must carve in the marble of latin and greek  the golden age of the english language however seems approaching to it is first state nothing contributes so much to corrupt it is purity as an inundation of frech translations rather than translations from the french the avarice of some and the hunger of others are continually pouring on us whole volumes disfigured with gallicisms and not infrequently whole sentences in french are aukwardly introduced as improvements doubtless to supply the deficiences of english language or rather those of the translator  yet it must be confessed there are some few french words which with great felicity express a sense of which we have no exact or parallel expressions we may indeed make use of phrases which may serve tolerably well to explain our meaning but the delicacy of expression seems to be lost  the ingenious vigneul marville has ventured to censure our language perhaps he was no competent judge of it is demerits at least his criticism is too often more sprightly than sound but we must confess that it is now a century since he flourished and if we reflect on the state of our language in his day it will not be found totally unjust   the style of the english writers is long and embarrassed very difficult to translate into latin into french or into italian we must recollect this when we read the works of the english authors in their own language with an intention to translate them perhaps the english would bear better to be translated into spanish than into french as the french is more happily rendered into greek than into latin the italian will find no language which without injuring it is delicacies and it is diminutives can afford a version the german language is well enough adapted to the latin  the reader may be pleased probably to hear an ingenious frenchman writing on our language thus express himself    he who loves the sciences should not neglect the english language if he would become acquainted with those excellent productions which breathe the warmest spirit of liberty let him give his studies to this language sir richard steel so celebrated for his other compositions has given us a good grammar accompanied with excellent notes the grammar of dr wallis is only proper for those who are conversant with the latin  perhaps the abovementioned grammar is quite forgotten i have in my possession a grammar of the english tongue with notes giving the grounds and reason of grammar in general printed for john brightland      to which is prefixed the approbation of isaac bickerstaff esq who i suppose is sir richard steel dressed out in masquerade he says that this grammar of the english tongue has done that justice to our language which till now it never obtained the text will improve the most ignorant and the notes employ the most learned i therefore enjoin all my female correspondents to buy read and study this grammar that their letters may be something less enigmatic etc it is dedicated to queen anne the notes are copious and by no means trifling they are not unworthy of accompanying lowths grammar  the dutch and german languages the knowledge of these two languages is more useful to travelers and merchants than to men of letters these two languages are disagreeable in their words and their pronunciation nor is their manner of expression clear neither the dutch or the germans make use of that easy phraseology which simply follows the connection of our ideas which joins naturally word with word according to their different signification they imitate rather the figurative turn of the latin in those inversions of phrase which hold the mind in suspense till the close of the sentence they bear so strong an affinity to each other that it is easy for one who is conversant with either to know the other the dutch is hardly any thing else than the old german the sound of the german language is more full and more agreeable than the dutch  the etymons of mummies and volume scaliger remarks that they have called mummies the bodies of the egyptians because they embalmed them with a perfume which they called amomum  we call a book frequently a volume the derivation of this word is from the latin volvere  to roll because the letters and the works of the ancients were written on very long leaves when the matter required it and when they closed them they were made up into rolls or volumes  character of the french the spanish and the italian languages there is this difference between these three languages the italian owes much of it is merit and it is softness to it is peculiar turn of phrase and the manner in which it employs it is diminutives thus it expresses with great felicity the sentiments of love the spanish draws all it nobleness and it is pomp from gigantic expressions and hyperboles of which no other language will admit the french appears to hold a middle rank between these two languages it can express with strength and vivacity the language of reason by representing things as they are it is thus well calculated for the compositions of history controversy theology and philosophy it seems however to be very unfortunate in it is poetical productions the french are hardly aware of it themselves but there is no correct ear that has been accustomed to english versification that can bear with any degree of patience it is tiresome monotony a french poet who was as great an admirer of latin verses as of wine compares french versification to the drinking of water it is satiric verse however has the preference  the italian of all the european languages after the french is the most general in use the facility with which it is acquired is one great cause of it is universality yet it must be remarked that if it is attained in some tolerable degree with so much ease it is indeed diffcult to grow conversant with all it is delicacies or to write or speak it to perfection those who wish to be informed of the best authors who have written in this language should consult the  reggionamento della eloquenza italiana of the abbe fontanini corrected and illustrated by the notes of apostolo zeno printed in two volumes quarto at venice      a work that bears for it is title  the italian library containing an account of the lives and works of the most valuable authors of italy by giuseppe baretti printed for millar       is very useful for one who wishes to recognize the numerous atuhors who have written in this polite language at least by their names the criticisms are amusive and bold in the manner of baretti whose pages it must be confessed whatever might be his errors as a man or as an author seldom were found to weary the reader  language  there is not observes a spirited french writer any language which may be deemed complete any that can express all our ideas and all our sensations their shades are imperceptible and too numerous no one can precisely reveal the degree of sensation which he feels we are constrained for instance to describe under the general name of love and hate all their variety of passion it is thus also of our griefs and pleasures so that all languages but imperfectly express the sensations of man  the living language there is no living language in europe which is older than five hundred years if we hope for immortality we must write in latin  chaucer gower lydgate and an infinite number of excellent writers have fallen martyrs to their patriotism by writing in their mother tongue spenser is not always intelligible without a glossary and when shakespeares rape of lucrece was republished a few years after his death his editor thought proper to explain certain expressions which had then become obsolete   the living languages says menage are more difficult to acquire than the dead it is now fifty years i have labored on my own and i must confess i am far from having attained perfection to know and to write excellently our mother tongue one must be acquainted with the ancient languages even more than with the modern the greater part of languages are closely connected by one chain the dissertation of pere besnier a jesuit on this subject is very curious he formed a project for the reunion of languages or the art of learning them all by a single one this plan may be seen in a little book printed at liege by nicholas le baragoin        he should have continued a project so pleasing and so useful his abilities were adequate to the task but unfortunately he had not the leisure to apply himself  if this plan is valuable which it appears to be by the account of two critical french writers who must be allowed able judges of this subject let some student who burns with the ambition of rendering an important service not alone to his country but to mankind eternize his name by devoting his life to an undertaking which will place his memory  above all roman and all grecian fame   an account of a curious philological book the volume i now notice i have never been fortunate enough to meet with it must be not only a singular curiosity but an invaluable work however imperfectly it may be compiled i draw this account of it from the matanasiana it may serve for a curious catalogue of languages   there is in french a thick quarto volume containing  0 0 pages printed in      which has for it is title    a treasury of the history of the languages of this universe containing the origin beauties perfections declensions mutations changes conversions and ruins of languages  hebrew cannanean samaritan chaldaic syriac egyptian punic arabic saracen turkish persian tartarian african morescan

languages of the beasts and birds the author of this wonderful work was mr claude duret president a moulins  this work is not much enlightened by criticism yet the perusal is very amusing we are surprised at the prodigious number of authors duret quotes in every page there are also added alphabets of every kind of characters and a variety of remarks historical as well as literary  arabic  it is astonishing exclaims longuerue through what an extent of countries the arabic language is spoken from bagdad to the cape of good hope  i find in the matanasiana page     the following criticism on this language besides postel and other maronites of mount libanus who have worked upon the arabic grammar thomas erpenius has composed it is rudiments which appeared in    0 and some time afterward a grammar by jean maire printed at leyden in      to which are appended the fables of lockman the arabic language is intelligent and energetic it is full of graceful turns and figurative expressions which give it great elevation and strength it is harmonious and it is good authors increase it is natural harmony by the care they take in their prosaic compositions to vary their periods and to introduce a cadence which has all the melody of verse the book the best written in this language is the alcoran  cardinal perron says that the arabic language is not only very sonorous but perhaps the richest and the most fertile we know it is also very useful for the explanations of many passages of scripture  the hebrew almost all those writers who have treated on the hebrew language would fain persuade us that it is the first that men have spoken but  what is more impertinent in them  they have the assurance to inform us that it is the language of god himself nor is this opinion by any means novel since saint gregory of nyssa has even in his lifetime reprobated the idea and calls it a folly and a ridiculous vanity of the jews as if god himself he says had been a master of grammar la motte le vayer writes in his letters that the most partial partisans which ever the hebrew has had must confess that excepting the inferior languages such as the bask and the breton etc there is not among the living or the dead languages any which do not present us with more valuable compositions than the hebrew does if we except the old testament he adds that he can well do without making use of a barbarous jargon that never repays us for the laceration which it occasions to our throats in pronouncing it is guttural letters  the hebrew grammars which the christians have composed are infinitely more perfect than those of the jews their knowledge in the writings of their rabbis is not inferior and to this they have added a clear and regular method which is very necessary in a language whose idioms and modes of expression the great distance of time has so obscured that it is almost impossible to attain to any perfect knowledge or to decide with any degree of certainty concerning it  buxtorf the father has surpassed all those who have devoted their studies to this language and later writers have done little more than copying or abridging his book it is entitled   j buxtorfii thesaurus grammaticus linguae sanctae hebreae duobus libris methodice propositus etc  we may add that the hebrew has no other difference between the syriac and the chaldee if we except the characters than that which exists between the latin and the italian  of the samaritan chaldaic syriac ethiopian persian armenian tartarian and chinese languages the greater part of these languages and the arabic itself are dialects of the hebrew and some so closely resemble it that the difference is hardly perceivable such are for instance the samaritan the chaldee and the syriac hottinger shows in his chaldaic grammar the affinity the hebrew bears to the chaldee the syriac and the arabic the jews brought the chaldee from babylon the books of daniel and esdras are for the greater part written in this language it was the syriac jesus christ and the apostles spoke and a knowledge of this language is very necessary for a perfect understanding of the new testament  ludolphus has given us a grammar of the ethiopian language this language has a great mixture of hebrew chaldee and arabic words it has a distinct and peculiar character and in writing it the vowel points are not marked according to the custom of the hebrews the arabs the chaldeans and the syrians but every letter is a syllable being at once composed of a vowel and a consonant  one louis de dieu has given a persian grammar but mr richardson has lately published a dictionary which is said to be a very valuable labor our nation has of late made such a progress in this study that we may expect when it shall become more universal to receive not only grammars and dictionaries but to partake in it is original compositions sir william jones whose learning is great and whose genius is equal to his learning has already laid the literary world under great obligations for some curious prose and some enchanting verse scaliger observes that the persian language is very beautiful and is expressed in few words it bears no analogy with the hebrew but what is surprising it does with the german having many words in common as father brother sister and other similar ones how are we to account for this  a tartarian grammar has been given by thevenot and by abbe bignon a chinese have we grammars of these languages  of all the languages of asia there are none which merit our attention more than the chinese and the persian for the arts and sciences have long and successfully been cultivated by these people  on the use of the pagan mythology in poetry a revolution has taken place in modern poetry which is of the greatest importance to the lovers of the art this is no less than a total banishment of the heathen mythology from our poetry the great johnson preferring not infrequently a singularity of opinion to an enforcing of truth  or let us confess who has given strong marks of a deficiency in poetical taste  has confounded the beauties of the pagan mythology with it is abuse we are to read the criticisms of this great man with caution we must recollect that in his examination of milton his prejudices warp his judgment and in his animadversions on gray his criticisms were uncandid and unpoetical he tells us in his life of prior that his fictions are mythological and that they are surely despicable for he adds  by the help of such easy fictions and vulgar topics without acquaintance with life and without knowledge of art or nature a poem of any length cold and lifeless like this may be easily written on any subject  this is dictated by the uncharitable spirit of criticism it is strange that a man of such active faculties and of such critical sagacity should not have perceived that when the poet wanders in the unbounded regions of fancy he has little to do with the mere state of nature that expatiating in the wide range of imagination he does not so much borrow from nature but rather adorns her by the creation of new beings hence the pipe of the shepherd is the shrill shell of pan the murmuring of the waters is the sigh of the naiad and the dewy flowers that sparkle on the eye are the glittering tears of aurora  i will allow that a pedant wellread in his pantheon may produce what some may be apt to take for a poem by a mere mechanical effort he may call apollo and the muses minerva and venus but let him beware of what he is about these celestial beings are no less dangerous than what in our british solomons time was thought to be the raising of the devil of whom one said that he doubted not with book in hand he could raise him easily enough but when he had done that the danger lay in the manner he was to employ his devilship the pedant may indeed lug into his verse the reluctant gods and godesses but they will not have the air of divinities it requires the most skilful hand and some of the finest touches of genius to place them in a novel situation to polish the finished piece into classical beauty and exhaust on them the pomp and brilliancy of his imagination  let us not then hastily resign our faith in the theology of ancient poetry if it appears trite and insipid in the hands of a mere versifier let us reflect that every thing in such a writer will have the same effect it is certain that no order of beings have yet been found so agreeable to the imagination when this poetic machinery is displayed by the address of superior genius how admirably has gray in his progress of poetry embellished with these beautiful forms the third stanza of the first antistrophy allegorical personages which spenser has unfortunately employed soon weary the enchantment of mythological fiction is continued and is susceptible of continual variety  the omnipotence of the divinities of poetry is eternal it is true they do not always yield their inspiration venus still resides in paphos diana still embellishes the woods the nymphs inhabit their accustomed oak and there is not a pure stream but in it is crystaline cave is still honored with the presence of it is naiad  i venerate the abilities of this our late coryphaeus but if we are blindly to follow the dictum of our leader farewell to that free discussion by which through the medium of contrary opinions we at length attain to truth the critical powers of boileau may well be opposed to those of johnson and however the english dress which sir william soame has given him may be inferior to the original boileau he may yet be understood  in the narration of some great design invention art and fable all must join here fiction must employ it is utmost grace all must assume a body mind and face each virtue a divinity is seen prudence is pallas  beauty paphos queen it is not a cloud from whence swift lightnings fly but jupiter that thunders from the sky echos no more an empty airy sound but a fair nymph that weeps her lover drowned thus in the endless treasures of his mind the poet does a thousand figures find around the work his ornaments he pours        without these ornaments before our eyes the unsinewed poem languishes and dies your poet in his art will always fail and tell you but a dull insipid tale in vain have our mistaken authors tried to lay these ancient ornaments aside     and in a common subject to reject the gods and heathen ornaments neglect to banish tritons who the sea invade to take pans whistle etc and every where as twere idolatry banish descriptions from our poetry leave them their pious follies to pursue but let our reason such vain fears subdue if the little i have ventured to give of my own supported by the critical authority of boileau should fail to relieve the modern poet from the harsh and severe tyranny of our present critics if we must quit greece the land of invention to live in our colder climate i will submit to it with all possible resignation but let me at least testify my veneration to the divinities of poetry in taking as poetical a farewell of them as the time will permit  o ye who felt the fancied power illuminate the mental hour we feebler scribes of later days have lost the beam that warmed your lays how wide for ye the enchantment streamed the universe one temple seemed what vivifying powers have stood in the still horrors of the wood auroras tears impearld the flowers and zephyr shook the fragrant bowers a naiads sigh the murmuring rill some sylvan power protects each hill if in the stream a nymph would lave she felt the gods embracing wave on every plain in every grove sported the rosy train of love and tripping fauns and satyrs rude were seen to wander every wood mid bleeding vines young bacchus lay tired with the labors of the day rich sheaves of corn kind ceres bears and orchards feel pomonas cares if breathes his reed some shepherd swain enamored echo steals the strain or shakes the field with horns and hounds it is dians self the shrill notes sounds old oceans realms are neptunes boast who swells the storm that threats the coast or if his lovely queen to please he chains his waves and smooths his seas seated in their pearly car the tritons song is heard afar and greenhaird nymphs their raptures tell dancing to the vocal shell the winged hours to shady seat from the hot fainting earth retreat but where olympus gates disclose jove sat and shook his awful brows his eagle basking in his sight waved often his plumes of beamy light and venus bends her softened face or leans on some enchanting grace while on her looks each god has hung whitehanded hebe scarce seemed young of past delight this classic theme once formed in youth my early dream farewell ye forms of grecian art that must no more inflame my heart our harsher souls and colder clime claim sentiment in polished rhyme fancy to reason must submit and glowing imagery to wit yet bards be taught from ancient source your rapid fligh to urge with force or still with baffled wing ye rise hurled from the poets starry skies on the poetry of baron haller it was once the intention of the editor to have presented a translation of the poetry of baron haller to the public  the poet whom i am now going to introduce to the reader is better known in this country for his extensive learning and recondite labors in physiology than for those exquisite pieces which place him so conspicuously amongst the modern poets of germany  if england has not bestowed on him the honors of a poet france however has not been backward in this respect his poetry has been elegantly translated and multiplied by repeated editions there are those who have placed him on an equality with the celebrated gesner and perhaps he is only not equal to him in not having produced a poem of the magnitude of his death of abel  if it is allowed me to give the character of haller as a poet i will say that he does not swell into that turgid eloquence which wearies the mental eye by a cumbrous accumulation of splendor it is the characteristic of the german poets that they do not know when to stop the strength of their genius transports them into obscurity by soaring too high they strain the temperate eye of the critics judgment to them is a silken string too feeble to chain the wing of an eagle  i do not mean however to countenance or excuse certain pieces which they inform us are translations from the german and which indeed may well disgust the world with all german poetry but i believe that the bombast of these writers is rather to be attributed to themselves than to the unfortunate german who certainly had he originally written in so awkward a style would not have been thought worthy of a translation  haller is beautiful in his descriptions sublime in his odes and tender in his elegies he is not less to be admired as a satirist and berne once trembled at the presence of it is juvenal his numbers are highly polished and it is hard to render justice to the delicate language of his muse  the following poem is not partially chosen but for it is convenient length there is an elegant simplicity added to a closeness of thought which if it does not always wear the fantastic air of novelty impresses in the feeling heart that philosophical consolation worthy of the genius of haller  a desire to regain his native country written when the author was in holland ah woods for ever dear delightful groves whose verdure shades the heights of hasel the neighborhood of berne when shall i return to repose on your bosom where philomel wantons on the light branches when shall i lay myself on the declivity of those little hills which nature has spread with green carpets of moss where naught is heard save the trembling leaves agitated by the vernal airs or the murmurs of a little brook that refreshes those solitary meads   o heaven when will thou permit me to visit once more those vales where i passed the spring of my life where often to the murmurs of a falling cascade my verse flowed in honor of my sylvia while the caresses of zephyr animating the grove threw on my pensive soul a soft melancholy there every care was banished while i sat in the umbrageous depth of those woods whose boughs were impenetrable to the beams of the sun   here continually have i to combat with my sorrows my mind is oppressed with grief for ever renewed and i know not the sweetness of tranquillity and joy far from the country where first i sprung into life without parents a stranger to all the world abandoned to the ardours of youth i find myself in possession of a dangerous liberty without having learnt how to conduct myself   now disease shoots through my languishing frame and stifles even the wish for glory and for science now my disappointed hopes droop in the despondence of discouragement and grief while the sea throws itself on the ruins of broken dykes and brings it is waves and death to our gates and mars threatens us with the flames of war which kindle from the ashes the inundation of the sea and the bursting of a dyke happen very frequently in winter at amsterdam  the dutch were then on the eve of a war    but let us embrace comfort all must terminate the storm is weakened at each gust it blows passed evils teach us to enjoy the present good who is a stranger to adversity is alike a stranger to pleasure time who with his rapid wing has brought my affliction conducts also my felicity i may yet inhale the purer air of my native hills   ah may i soon rejoin ye groves beloved and landscapes of spring ah if fate should indulge me once more to partake of the silent tranquillity of your solitude perhaps the day is not distant the blue sky shines when the storm is departed and repose succeeds to pain flourish ye scenes of delight while i prepare to make my last voyage in returning to your peaceful shades  the poetry of haller versified the lover of polite literature will be much gratified by the following enchanting versification of the poem of haller which we have feebly attempted to reduce into prose the present versification as spirited as it is elegant is the production of a very superior poet to whom the editor stands too deeply indebted to pass over the recollection of benefits received from his criticisms without being alive to the warmest sense of gratitude this little production to use one of his own classical allusions will be but interweaving a transient blossom in the laurels of it is amiable author  ah woods for ever dear whose branches spread their verdant arch over hasels breezy head when shall i once again supinely laid hear philomela charm your listening shade when shall i stretch my careless limbs again where gently rising from the velvet plain over the green hills in easy curve that bend the mossy carpet natures hands extend where all is silent save the gales that move the leafy umbrage of the whispering grove or the soft murmurs of the rivulets wave whose chearing streams the lonely meadows lave o heaven when shall once more these eyes be cast on scenes where all my spring of life was passed where often responsive to the falling rill sylvia and love my artless lays would fill while zephyrs fragrant breeze soft breathing stole a pleasing sadness over my pensive soul care and her ghastly train were far away while calm beneath the sheltering woods i lay mid shades impervious to the beams of day here  sad reverse  from scenes of pleasure far i wage with sorrow unremitting war oppressed with grief my lingering moments flow nor aught of joy or aught of quiet know far from the scenes that gave my being birth from parents far an outcast of the earth in youths warm hours from each restriction free left to myself in dangerous liberty now pale disease shoots through my languid frame and checks the zeal for wisdom and for same now droops fond hope by disappointment crossed chilled by neglect each sanguine wish is lost over the weak mound stern oceans billows ride and waft destruction in with every tide while mars descending from his crimson car fans with fierce hands the kindling flames of war her gentle aid let consolation lend all human evils hasten to their end the storm abates at every gust it blows past ills enhance the comforts of repose he who never felt the pressure of distress never felt returning pleasures keen excess time who affliction bore on rapid wing my panting heart to happiness may bring i on my native hills may yet enhale the purer influence of the ambient gale ah scenes of early joy ah muchloved shades soon may my footsteps tread your vernal glades ah should kind heaven permit me to explore your seats of still tranquillity once more even now to fancys visionary eye hope shows the flattering hour of transport nigh blue shines the ether when the storm is passed and calm repose succeeds to sorrows blast flourish ye scenes of ever new delight wave wide your branches to my raptured fight while never to roam again my wearied feet seek the kind refuge of your calm retreat index a abbot of st aubin
