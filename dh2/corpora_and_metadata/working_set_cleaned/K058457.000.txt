the following essays are by permission most humbly inscribed to her majesty by her most dutiful loyal and obedient subject the author  essays addressed to young married women   seek to be good but aim not to be great  a womans noblest station is retreat  her fairest virtues fly from public sight  domestic worth that shuns too strong a light lord lyttelton london printed for t cadell in the strand and j robson in new bondstreet mdcclxxxii  introduction almost every moral writer or essayist that i have happened to meet with from the days of solomon to the present era have complained of the profligacy and degeneracy of their times from hence we are led to believe that folly and vice have been equally prevalent in all ages and that there is no such period to be found in the annals of human nature as that golden age in which wisdom and virtue dwelt with men  that perfection is not the lot of mortals i readily admit and cannot therefore prefume to point out the exact modes of any particular period of time as objects of general imitation but without venturing to oppose my slight opinion against the common and willinglyreceived adage that the world is just as good as it was a thousand years ago i will pronounce that though virtue and vice may have traveled progressively upon the same scale since the creation to this day the influence of folly and her inseparable companions vanity and dissipation have within the present century been extended in britain to a degree not only unknown to but inconceivable by our ancestors  the chief causes of this sad effect we are told originate in the improper plan of education which has been adopted for our young ladies but as new and useful lights have been thrown upon this subject by abler pens than mine particularly by those two excellent and elegant writers mrs chapone and miss more i shall not dwell upon it but mean humbly to offer my sentiments to those of my sex who having passed through the restraints necessarily imposed on youth are ready to launch into the tempestuous ocean of life without any chart to sail by but their native innocence and unsuspecting cheerfulness  while they preserve the first they will not strike against the rock most fatal to their peace but grant they should escape that imminent danger there are a thousand hidden shoals within this stormy sea where female happiness may suffer wreck from these it is my most earnest wish to save them and send them floating down the stream of time loaded with days and honor  as it is generally supposed that a thorough knowledge of the art we mean to teach is indispensably necessary in every science the author of the following essays with the truest gratitude to the almighty for such an inestimable blessing presumes to hope that after thirty years of uninterrupted happiness in the marriagestate she may be deemed qualified at least as far as experience can direct to speak upon the most interesting of all earthly subjects to those who are but entering on that state of probation wherein a strict adherence to its delightful duties must lead to the final reward of happiness here and hereafter  essays addressed to young married women religion from the time that a woman enters into the holy and honorable state of matrimony she becomes accountable for her conduct both toward god and man separated from the fostering care of tender and indulgent parents who have hitherto directed her footsteps in the way that she should walk and left to choose her path amidst the stormy or the flowery way where shall she find a clue to direct her inexperience through the labyrinth that now lies before her one unerring guide remains which if she truly seeks his word will be a lanthorn to her feet and a light unto her paths and when her father and her mother forsake her he will take her up  as the spring to the year so is youth to the soul the season of blooming virtue without blossoms there can be no fruit and the barren mind that is not early imbued with the knowledge of the love of god which alone constitutes our happiness here and our hopes hereafter will seek in vain for the delight it yields in those maturer days when worldly cares and disappointments have soured the natural benevolence of the heart and rendered it callous to the refined feelings of sensibility  zeal without knowledge is the parent of bigotry and bigotry is too often the adopted religion of wrinkles and gray hairs from hence it sometimes happens that devotion assumes the mask of austerity which by concealing the beauty of holiness must rather deter than invite the inexperienced mind from entering into that service which is perfect freedom whose ways are ways of pleasantness and whose paths are those of peace  but whilst the blessings and pleasures of youth flow around us the heart must naturally be expanded with gratitude gratitude produces praise and praise is surely the most acceptable sacrifice that a human creature can offer to the great author of good but alas surrounded by the delights of life we too frequently become forgetful of the source from whence they are derived and whilst we are indulging all our appetites in the delicious stream of happiness it becomes impregnated with the qualities of lethe and renders us unmindful of its fountain  let then the sensible and innocent bride remember her creator in the days of her youth while the evil days come not nor the years draw nigh when she shall say i have no pleasure in them ecclesiastes chap xii ver    doctor young says the whole creation cannot furnish a more lovely sight than a beautiful young woman upon her knees addressing her maker in fervent prayer and if i might presume to add my sentiments i would say that it is a sight at which men and angels should rejoice  every young and innocent woman must necessarily feel a painful diffidence on her first entrance into the bustle of life a thorough sense of religion alone can dispel her apprehensions give calmness to her mind and steadiness to her conduct for while we consider ourselves under the immediate guidance and protection of an allwise and allpowerful being what have we to fear true confidence arises from such a dependence and fills the mind with that sweet peace which goodness bosoms ever  mr addison very justly observes that a mind which has the least turn to religion naturally flies to it in affliction we then begin to feel our own insufficiency we are humbled by sorrow and perhaps only then deduce real satisfaction from a thorough conviction that there is a superior being whose aid is graciously promised to those who sincerely seek it  but though  religions force divine is best displayed  in a desertion of all human aid we must by no means presume to hope for the consolation it can bestow in the days of affliction if we have neglected to receive and submit to its legislative authority in the hours of youth and prosperity you must first apply to it as the guide of life before you can have recourse to it as the refuge of sorrow dr blairs sermons  but if laboring under the severest ills which this world can inflict we can truly say i have endeavored to do my duty in the state i have been called to i have walked humbly with my god have made my peace with him and patiently submit to his allwise decrees such reflections will cheer the lonely house of virtuous poverty soothe the complaints of grief lighten the pressure of old age and furnish to the bed of sickness a cordial of more grateful relish and more sovereign virtue than any which this world can afford dr blairs sermons   though the motives which i have hitherto urged for an early attachment to our religious duties seem only to relate to the happy individual who like solomon has sought wisdom early and found her there can be no doubt of the innumerable benefits which society must reap as far as her influence extends from the conduct and example of a truly religious woman in whatever point of view she may be placed as daughter wife mother sister or friend the governing principle of her life the love of god will operate upon her conduct in the relative duties of her station and render that perfect in each and every degree  i cannot conclude this important subject without presenting to my fair readers that elegant portrait which the wisest of men and divinest of poets has given them of one whom they should endeavor to imitate if they desire to attain happiness and honor in this life and everlasting felicity in that to come  who can find a virtuous woman for her price is far above rubies  the heart of her husband does safely trust in her so that he shall have no need of spoil  she lays her hands to the spindle and her hands hold the distaff  she stretches out her hand to the poor yea she stretches forth her hands to the needy  strength and honor are her clothing and she shall rejoice in time to come  she opens her mouth with wisdom and in her tongue is the law of kindness  she looks well to the ways of her household and eats not the bread of idleness  her children rise up and call her blessed her husband also and he praises her  many daughters have done virtuously but thou excellest them all  favor is deceitful and beauty is vain but the woman that fears the lord she shall be praised proverbs chap xxxi   conjugal affection  hail wedded love mysterious law true source  of human offspring sole propriety  in paradise of all things common else  by thee adulterous lust was driven from men  among the bestial herds to range by thee  founded in reason loyal just and pure  relations dear and all the charities  of father son and brother first were known  as the union of hearts is universally allowed to be the bond of marriage so the entering into such a connection without possessing the essence or first principle on which it should be founded must render the ceremony of none effect and can in reason and equity only be considered as a state of legal prostitution to speak of conjugal felicity to the wretched victims of parental authority of avarice or poverty would be absurd or cruel as they must either be incapable of forming an idea of it or doomed for ever to lament its loss  i therefore in this section particularly address myself to the happy few whom love unites in hymens rosy bands and profess to teach the art of making their happiness as permanent as the instability of mere mortal natures will admit of  love is a term so very vague and indiscriminate as it is generally applied that it would be extremely difficult to investigate its nature from its effects in any other case but that of marriage as the modes perhaps of feeling or at least of expressing it vary according to the temper manner or situation of each individual who either feels or feigns the passion  but conjugal affection is by no means subject to such equivocal appearances it is tenderness heightened by passion and strengthened by esteem it is unmixed with any selfish or sensual allay tending solely to promote the happiness of its object here and hereafter  such an elevated state of happiness as must result from the affection i have described when mutual must surely be the acme of human felicity but as the point of perfection is that of declension also it will require much pains but they are pleasing ones to make the everturning wheel of sublunary bliss keep steady to the summit it has reached or at least to prevent its rolling down the rugged precipice where jealousy disgust and grief have marked the horrid road  the disappointments of human life must ever be proportioned to the extravagance of our expectations too great an ardour to be blessed is frequently the source of misery a life of transport is not the lot of mortals while we accept we should chastise our joys lest while we clasp we kill them  that concord of souls which constitutes the happiness of marriage like a full concert requires all the parts obliged to fill their several stations in perfect time and place for though the heart may lead the band and set out in perfect harmony one jarring note destroys the rapturous strain and turns the whole to discord for this reason i consider a parity of understanding and temper to be as necessary toward forming an happy marriage as an equality of years rank and fortune  but grant these circumstances all conjoin and make the union perfect remember my fair friends satiety succeeds to rapture as sure as night to day be it your province then to keep your husbands heart from sinking into the incurable disease of tasteless apathy do not rely too much upon your personal charms however great to preserve the conquest they may have gained  by a proper attention to your husband you will easily discover the bent of his genius and inclinations to that turn all your thoughts and let your words and actions solely tend to that great point the kindness of your attention will awaken his and gratitude will strengthen his affection imperceptibly even to himself  our first parent justifies his fondness for eve to raphael upon this principle  neither her outside formed so fair etc  so much delights me as those graceful acts  those thousand decencies that daily flow  from all her words and actions mixed with love  and sweet compliance which declare unfeigned  union of mind or in us both one soul  harmony to behold in wedded pair  more grateful than harmonious sound to the ear   in an age like this when we may suppose that every young lady deserves the epithet with which adam addresses his wife accomplished eve it must be less difficult than it might have been for their female ancestors to secure the affections of a husband already prepossessed in their favor let them but exert the same talents with the same desire of pleasing which they showed before marriage and i venture to pronounce that they will succeed  a love of power and authority is natural to men and wherever this inclination is most indulged will be the situation of their choice every man ought to be the principal object of attention in his family of course he should feel himself happier at home than in any other place it is doubtless the great business of a womans life to render his home pleasing to her husband he will then delight in her society and not seek abroad for alien amusements a husband may possibly in his daily excursions see many women whom he thinks handsomer than his wife but it is generally her fault if he meet with one that he thinks more amiable a desire of pleasing very rarely fails of its effect but in a wife that desire must be managed with the nicest delicacy it should appear rather in the result than in the design not obvious not obtrusive these petits soins are the best supplement to our great duties and render the commerce of life delightful like an elegant dessert they complete the feast and leave not a wish unsatisfied  we have hitherto looked only on the pleasing side of the tapestry and seen marriage in its most favorable light let us now turn the canvas and take a view of its defects  let us suppose then what i think the worst of all situations an amiable young woman possessing the tenderest affection for her husband while he from the natural depravity and inconstancy of his nature has withdrawn his love from her and perhaps bestowed it on some unworthy object to whom he devotes his time and fortune  in such a state of wretchedness what line shall our neglected wife pursue the first step that i would recommend to her is that of entering into a serious strict and impartial review of her own conduct even to the minutiae of her dress and the expressions of her looks from the first of her acquaintance of her husband if after such examination she cannot discover any fault in her manners that might have given offense or created disgust let her steadily pursue the same behavior she has hitherto practiced for if that be totally free from error it is impossible that any alteration can give an additional efficacy to it for to resent or to retaliate neither her duty nor her religion will permit  to carry smiles upon the face when discontentent sits brooding at the heart is i confess one of the most difficult tasks that can possibly be imposed on an ingenuous and feeling soul but a thorough conviction that it is her province to endeavor to recall the wanderer back for his own happiness as well as here is and a certainty that there are no other means of accomplishing so desirable an end will enable her to pursue this arduous undertaking till either her heart shall rejoice in its success or from reiterated disappointments become indifferent to the worthless object of its former esteem and attention  granting the last to be the case she has a right to expect the good opinion of the world will attend her conduct but an higher and more certain reward awaits it selfapprobation arising from a consciousness of having fulfilled her duty and an assurance of having essayed the only method that was likely to insure success for never yet was love recalled by lamentations or upbraidings the first may sometimes perhaps create pity but oftener begets contempt and the latter never did nor can produce any passion but instant rage or cool determined hate  recollection may furnish to my fair readers many instances where patient sufferings have been rewarded with returning love but i think there is scarcely one to be met with where female violence has ever conquered male outrage or where dissipation and coquetry though they may have alarmed the pride ever reclaimed the alienated affections of a husband  true love like true virtue shrinks not on the first attack it will bear many shocks before it be entirely vanquished as it contends not for victory but for the prize it will not display itself in the vain arts of elocution but in the more powerful eloquence of action it will leave nothing undone that can prove its sincerity but it will not boast even to its object of what it has done much less will it vaunt its merits to any other confidant or complain to the world of the unkind return it has met with  there are such a variety of circumstances which may disturb the happiness of the marriagestate that it is impossible to specify them all but as a virtuous woman will consider the loss of her husbands affection as the greatest calamity that can befall her her duty and prudence will before the evil happens upon every occasion supply rules of conduct to herself and the reliance she will necessarily have upon the tenderness of his attachment to her joined to the sincerity of here is to him will support her through every difficulty which accident misfortune or even imprudence may have brought upon them she will say with priors emma thy rise of fortune did i only d from its decline determined to recede did i but purpose to embark with thee on the smooth surface of a summers sea while gentle zephyrs play in prosperous gales and fortunes favor fills the swelling sails but would forsake the bark and make the shore when the winds whistle and the tempests roar no henry no one sacred oath has tied our loves one destiny our lives shall guide nor wild nor deep our common way divide   this is the natural language of conjugal affection this the fulfilling of the marriage vow where self is lost in a still dearer object where tenderness is heightened by distress and attachment cemented even by the tears of sorrow such an union of souls may brave the power of time and i trust that death itself shall not be able to destroy it  temper it has been already remarked that a parity of temper is one of the principal requisites in matrimonial happiness and yet it is possible that too great a similarity of disposition may in some cases render both parties wretched for instance if two persons of a gay and careless turn of mind should happen to be united both will think themselves entitled to pursue their joint or separate amusements without being encumbered with any attention to domestic economy till even the necessary means for their support may be irretrievably lavished away  again should two persons of a saturnine complexion be joined in the indissoluble bond of marriage the natural gloominess of their dispositions will be increased by each others converse melancholy will become habitual and care be heightened to despondency  not minds of melancholy strain  still silent or that still complain  can the dear bondage bless  as well may heavenly concerts spring  from two old lutes with never a string  or none besides the bass  nor can the soft enchantment hold  two jarring souls of angry mold  the rugged and the keen  sampsons young foxes might as well  in bands of cheerful wedlock dwell  with firebrands tied between   from these examples it is obvious that a similitude of dispositions alone though a strong incentive to affection will not always ensure matrimonial felicity and yet i am perfectly convinced that wherever there is any material different eof sentiments or manners there never was or will be a happy marriage we naturally admire those we love and as naturally imitate what we admire the similarity that arises from conformity and a desire to please has a superior charm to that which is merely complexional to adopt the sentiments of a person is the most delicate proof of approbation and esteem and perhaps the compliment is valued by our selflove in proportion to the sacrifice which has been made of an opposite way of thinking  that conformity of manners as far as religion and reason will permit is one of the indispensible duties of a wife will not i believe be denied by any one but there are ladies who have an art of letting their condescension appear too strongly in the act as if submitting to the impositions of a tyrant rather than cheerfully fulfilling the obligation they had entered into at the altar  to love honor and obey  the same words or actions expressed or performed in a gracious or ungracious manner may produce effects as different as love and hate i would therefore recommend it to the candidates for happiness in the marriagestate to sacrifice to the graces in their conjugal demeanor as sincerely as they do at their toilets for goodbreeding is as necessary to the preservation of domestic harmony as it can possibly be to the general intercourse and commerce of life  solomon in his description of a virtuous woman before quoted has furnished us with the finest idea that ever was given of a wifes address to her husband she opens her mouth with wisdom and in her tongue is the law of kindness and surely there exists not a being under the form of man who could reject such an address with scorn or insolence  we should however take particular care to time our conversation with our husbands and neither idly obtrude upon their serious hours of business or retirement nor hastily mistake that reserve or gloom which may arise from difficulties in their affairs abroad for illtemper or disgust at home  it is the duty of a wife not only to regulate her own temper toward her husband but also to pay such an attention to his as may prevent it from ever appearing in a disagreeable light by studiously observing the proper seasons for the different subjects on which she may have occasion to address him she may imperceptibly to him and almost to herself obtain the power of guiding his concurrence or denial  a sensible and virtuous woman pursuing such a line of conduct for the mutual advantage of her husband and family without any selfish views which only little minds are capable of comes nearest to the idea that mortals are taught to conceive of a guardian angel who unseen directs our doubtful choice to what is best and leads our erring steps into the paths of happiness and peace  i have hitherto considered this great article of temper only in one point of view merely as it relates to the colloquial intercourse between a wedded pair i come now to show that its influence is universally extensive and that it is one of the main springs which guides or deranges the human machine through every station and situation of life  an unmarried woman is very rarely said to be illtempered and yet there are such prodigies in nature as young vixens who however they may conceal their illhumour from their lovers and general acquaintance will surely betray it to their parents inmates and servants a little lump leaveneth the whole and a peevish maiden will infallibly make a cross wife for when once a sourness of disposition becomes habitual there is no alkaline in nature sufficiently powerful to correct the heartburnings and bitterness of a dissatisfied temper a person so affected like one infected with the plague necessarily spreads the contagion of discontent around her her parents lament the badness of her disposition her other relations and connections are sensible of aversion instead of affection toward her and her servants regret that the irksomeness of servitude is aggravated by receiving their subsistence from a tyrant whom they can neither please respect or love  as gravity which is sometimes but another name for dullness has been frequently mistaken for wisdom so is cheerfulness often accepted for good humor but that species of cheerfulness which we meet with in society that laughs in the eye and lights up the countenance generally proceeds rather from an ebullition of the spirits than a designed and consistent exertion of our powers to please and is more frequently the result of a lively than a placid disposition as it flows from an accidental cause its effects must necessarily be precarious it is therefore subject to causeless and sudden dejection to which habitual good humor is by no means liable  distinct as these two qualities are they have yet one property common to both and at the same time different from what can be imputed to any other happy endowment which is that they are most meritorious where they are least natural an idiot may be constitutionally goodhumoured and a villain be cheerful from a glow of health or a flow of spirits but that species of good humor which is the result of sense virtue and gratitude to providence will be uniform in its appearance and consistent in its manners it will not like an april day lour and shine almost in the same moment nor like the flaming heats of july will the brightness of the meridian sun foretell the approaching thunder but clear calm and undisturbed shall it shine on even to its latest hour  such a blessed state of mind must necessarily communicate the happiness it feels to all around it like the smooth stream it reflects every object in its just proportion and in its fairest colors while the turbulent and ruffled spirit like troubled waters renders back the images of things distorted and broken and communicates to them all that disordered motion which arises solely from its own agitation dr blair   this beautiful simile has a double claim to female attention for rage jealousy or any other ungentle passion deform the fairest face almost as much as they degrade the mind and can unsex the loveliest of the lovely kind even from the top to toe  but there is a higher and a stronger motive than any i have yet mentioned for possessing our souls in gentleness if we presume to call ourselves christians shall the disciple of a suffering savior dare to resent with furious outrage the real or imaginary injuries she may receive or can she kneel before the throne of mercy and supplicate the god of peace and good will to man for pardon or protection while her heart is agitated with a spirit of malice or revenge toward a fellow creature frail as her wretched self this were an insult upon piety a mockery of devotion  we are assured that god rejects the proud and that an humble and a contrite heart are precious in his sight shall we then cast away the heartfelt transport of thinking ourselves under the guidance and protection of an almighty providence to sacrifice to moloch and give away the birthright of the redeemed for the sad privilege of torturing ourselves for providence has wisely ordained that all the malevolent passions of the human breast should prey upon their possessors peace never dwelt with envy rage or hate  as marriage among christians is of divine institution all married persons should consider a proper conduct toward each other as the fulfilling of a religious duty to promote harmony peace order and happiness in their families is the mutual and undoubted obligation both of man and wife this rule once established and reduced to practice even libertines will own that marriage is the happiest state on earth but when the fiends of discord rage confusion and misery usurp the place of those dear household gods their very opposites we must agree with dr tillotson and own that such a state is but a lesser hell in passage to the greater  be it your care then my gentle and muchinterested readers to reverse this sad idea and by the mildness of your manners and the sweetness of your tempers render the marriagestate a lesser heaven in passage to the greater  neatness neatness is the offspring of decency and the parent of elegance and to her perhaps are my fair countrywomen more indebted for the power of making and preserving their conquests than to any other of those numerous charms which they possess in common with the rest of their sex  at this polished era when elegance at least as far as it relates to form and dress seems to be elevated almost into a science which is become more the object of study and attention than any of those which are to be found in the encyclopedia it may seem superfluous to say much upon the subject of this chapter but though i should wish neatness and elegance to be ever united yet i would not by any means have them confounded together as they certainly are as distinct as light and shade in painting and like them too when happily combined they mutually reflect grace on each other while the charming result of both amounts to something than beauty more  in the beginning of this almost finished century the most refined moralist of his age or nation told his fair cotemporaries that wrappinggowns and dirty linen were the bane of conjugal love addison  yet in those days our grandmothers might possibly have thought they dressed as elegantly as the present race of young women imagine they do now but then less enlightened than their happier descendants they might vainly presume that the brilliancy of their charms when heightened by dress and animated by the gaiety of an opera or a ball could efface the disgust which a husband might have conceived from the indelicacy of their appearance in their own apartments how vain indeed must such an idea seem to us who know that disgust is perhaps the only unconquerable sentiment of the human mind and that it can never be detached from the unfortunate object which has once inspired it the application of this knowledge is too obvious to need any comment  the qualities of neatness extend much farther than to the exterior or even the interior of dress the house as well as person nay the mind of an accomplished woman should be regulated by the same spirit for it is very possible to meet with a littered head though bien coiffee and a slatternly mind in a very elegant form  neatness is to the person what purity is to the mind in many instances they are so perfectly analogous that they seem to be rather a simple than a complex idea but though their qualities appear so very similar they are alas at sometimes disunited they have however one striking characteristic common to both which is that art will upon examination be always found deficient to imitate their unaffected excellence  i shall conclude these few imperfect hints with lord lytteltons beautiful lines upon the same subject  do thou my fair endeavor to possess  an elegance of mind as well as dress etc   domestic amusement variety is in general the very essence of amusement how then is it possible to fix an idea which exists but in change or how define a term the meaning of which may be understood so differently by different persons  yet still every human mind requires relaxation and amusement will be sought and should be found by persons of every condition in life those whom providence has placed in elevated situations of rank or fortune have undoubtedly an infinite advantage over their inferiors in this article as a proper and liberal education must have afforded them an early taste for two of the most elegant amusements that can be enjoyed namely reading and music whoever has felt the charms of these delightful avocations will never be subject to that miserable complaint called ennui nor lament the want of company or employment for a few hours in any part of a short day for such the longest will seem to those who can so well employ it  drawing and painting are also delightful resources to those whom favoring genius has led to such sweet arts but talents for these are rare and those who are so peculiarly gifted should be particularly grateful for such rare endowments  but besides these inexhaustible funds of rational amusement there are still an infinite number of minor resources which may afford us occupations sufficient to combat the tediousness of life even supposing it to be passed in solitude the great variety of needleworks which the ingenious women of other countries as well as of our own have invented will furnish us with constant and amusing employment and though our labors of the loom may not equal a minervas or an aylesburys yet if they unbend the mind by fixing its attention on the progress of any elegant or imitative art they answer the purpose of domestic amusement and when the higher duties of our situation do not call forth our exertion we may feel the satisfaction of knowing that we are at least innocently employed  while under the influence of this calm sentiment we shall be less apt to rush into the torrent of dissipation where conjugal happiness is too frequently lost or at least endangered by the poisonous gales of flattery which though breathed from coxcombs whom we may in our hearts despise will in some sort render us despicable for no woman listens to adulation whose vanity is not flattered bity  but there is still another danger from which constant and innocent amusement may help to preserve us i mean the destructive vortex of a gamingtable where every soft and feminine grace is swallowed up by avarice where our internal peace must necessarily be destroyed by the anxious solicitude of hope and fear which can only terminate in the most painful of all feelings to an ingenuous mind the consciousness of having voluntarily erred  as the world is at present constituted it is almost impossible for any person who mixes with it to avoid play and cards as a mere amusement may sometimes be deemed an innocent one conversation is not to be met with in large and mixed companies and a cardtable considered as an universal leveller may have its use by placing the weak and timid on a par with the most lively and overbearing but in order to render play what it should be an amusement merely a line must be drawn by the circumstances of each individual with regard to the expense for  what is in the captain but a choleric word  is in the soldier downright blasphemy there can be therefore but one general rule devised which is never to play for more than you can afford to lose without breaking in upon the necessary claims of your family your dress or your charities i shall only add that those who engage at play on any other terms than what i have mentioned will soon discover that they have exchanged their down for thorns and will perhaps too late remember the just picture which mr pope has drawn of those unhappy female beings who pass not spend a life of idleness and dissipation  mark how the world its veterans rewards  a youth of frolic an old age of cards  fair to no purpose artful to no end  young without lovers old without a friend etc   friendship the ancients ranked friendship in the second class of human virtues and many are the instances recorded in history where its energy has produced effects almost divine considered in its perfect strength and beauty it certainly is the most sublime because the least selfish affection of the soul  honor is its very essence courage frankness and generosity its unalienable properties such is the idea delivered down to us of this noble sentiment by its cotemporary writers who together flourished and together fell for some centuries have elapsed since this exalted phoenomenon has deigned to appear among the degenerate sons of men and like a mutilated statue it is now become rather an object of admiration to a few virtuosi in philosophy than a subject for general emulation  montaigne amongst the moderns seems to have felt a stronger emanation of this virtue than any author i am acquainted with and though the utmost stretch of his warm imagination gives us but a faint ray of its ancient luster yet even this slight resemblance appears too strong for our weak eyes and seems rather to dazzle than attract our regards  our cotemporary dr young has left us several very beautiful descriptions of friendship which though deficient of that fire which not only blazed but burned in this ancient virtue are however sufficient to form both our theory and our practice upon  true friendship warms it raises it transports  like music pure the joy without allay  whose very rapture is tranquillity this is a very pleasing and just description of friendship in the abstract but it wants that energy which particular attachments add to all our sentiments and without which like a winters sun they shine but do not warm  the same author has given us a more interesting though perhaps less elevated idea of this affection of the mind in his address to a particular person  lorenzo pride suppress nor hope to find  a friend but what has found a friend in thee   this is a new and i think a just light in which we may consider this sentiment for though love may be formed without sympathy friendship never can it is even in its degenerate state an affection that cannot subsist in vicious minds and among the most virtuous it requires a parity of sentiment manners and rank for its basis of all the nice ties and dependencies which constitute the happiness or misery of life it is the most delicate and even the most fragile wealth cannot purchase nor gifts ensure its permanence the chirping of birds in cages bears as much resemblance to the vocal music of the woods as bought courtesies to real friendship the great alas rarely enjoy this blessing vanity and emulation prevent its growth among equals and the humiliating condescension with which superiors sometimes deign to affect friendship for their inferiors strikes at the very foundation of the sentiment from which there can only arise a tottering superstructure whose pillars like those of modern composition bear the gloss but want the durable quality of the mental marble sincerity yet there have been instances though rare of real friendship between persons of different ranks in life particularly henry the fourth and sully but the virtues of the latter placed him on a level with monarchs and the magnanimity of the former made him sensible of their equality  yet how often are complaints uttered by disappointed pride against the ingratitude of those whom they have honored with the title of friend nay and have even served and obliged as such without reflecting that obligations to a generous mind are insults when accompanied with the least slight or mortification  on the other hand we perhaps too willingly attach ourselves to our superiors our selflove is flattered by their approbation as it naturally imagines it can only be for our good and amiable qualities that they like or distinguish us but though love like death makes all distinction void friendship has no such levelling power superiority of rank or fortune is generally felt by the person who possesses either and they are entitled to some degree of praise if they do not make others feel it also  let those then who have delicate minds remember that equality is the true basis of friendship let them set a just value on their own worth as well as on the inebriating smiles of greatness and not expose their sensibility to the pangs it must sustain on discovering that neither virtues or talents can always keep the scale of friendship steady when opposed to the adventitious circumstances of high birth or great fortune  thus far my remarks upon this subject are general let me now apply them to their use for whom this little work is peculiarly designed by earnestly recommending it to every young married woman to seek the friend of her heart in the husband of her affection there and there only is that true equality both of rank and fortune strengthened by mutual interests and cemented by mutual pledges to be found there only condescensions will not mortify as they will be concessions but of kindness not of pride there and there only will she be sure to meet with reciprocal confidence unfeigned attachment and tender solicitude to soothe her every care the ties of wedded love will be rivetted by the bands of friendship the virtues of her mind when called sorth by occasion will unfold themselves by degrees to her husbands perception like the opening rose before the morning ray and when its blooming color fades upon her cheek its sweetness shall remain within the very foldings of his heart from recollection of her sense and worth happy are the pairs so joined yea blessed are they who are thus doubly united  as the word friendship is at present generally understood to be a term of little import or at most that extends merely to a preference of liking or esteem i would by no means exclude my fair readers from that kind of commerce which is now accepted under that title in society but even this sort of connection requires much caution in the choice of its object for i should wish it might be restrained to one and that one ought to obtain this preference from the qualities of the heart rather than those of the head a long and intimate acquaintance can alone discover the former the latter are easily and willingly displayed for love without esteem is as a shower soon spent the head is the spring of affections but the heart is the reservoir  for this reason it always appears to me a proof of mutual merit when two sisters or two young women who have been brought up together are strongly attached to each other and i will admit that while they remain unmarried such a connection is capable of forming a pure and disinterested friendship provided that the sympathy of their affections does not tend to make them like or admire the same male object for though love may friendship cannot exist with jealousy  reserve will wound it and distrust destroy   that great master of the human heart shakespeare has shown us that maidenly attachment is no match for the stronger passion of love  is all the counsel that we two have shared  the sister vows the hours that we have spent  when we have chid the hastyfooted time  for parting us  o and is all forgot  all schooldays friendship childhood innocence  we hermia like two artificial gods  created with our needles both one flower  both on one sampler sitting on one cushion  both warbling of one song both in one key  as if our hands our sides voices and minds  had been incorprate midsummer nights dream  if such an almost instinctive affection as that between hermia and helena was so quickly dissolved by the intruder love i fear there are but few female friendships that will better stand the test and to a delicate mind it may appear a breach perhaps of those sister vows when one of the parties enters into another and more forcible engagement for love is an imperious and engrossing tyrant of course the gentler affection must give way and retire within itself as the sensitive plant shrinks back oppressed by too intense an heat  in my small experience i have never seen the same degree of attachment subsist between two ladies after marriage as before excepting they were sisters the bands of natural affection are not loosened by new engagements but those of choice or casualty necessarily become relaxed by the addition of a new object as extension lessens strength  the minds of most young women seem and indeed ought to do so in reality to acquire a new bent after marriage scenes different from those to which they had been accustomed open to their view different objects engross their attention every state has its cares and from the queen to the peasant every wife has duties to fulfill frivolous amusements are or should be renounced for the more pleasing and respectable avocations of an affectionate wife a tender mother and a beloved and honored matron of a family  i hope it is impossible that i should be so far misunderstood as to be thought to exclude married women from any innocent pleasure or rational amusement that is suited to their age rank or fortune i would not only ensure but augment their happiness and shall therefore say with othello where virtue is these are most virtuous but still there is or should be a difference in the enjoyment of their pleasures between the thoughtless gaiety of girls and the decent cheerfulness of married women the first is bright and transient as the youthful glow of health and vivacity that blooms upon the cheek the latter should express that tranquil joy which flows from true content  i may be thought to have somewhat wandered from the particular subject of this chapter though i hope not from the general object of the work i shall now conclude with observing that as the characters and conduct of even her common acquaintance reflect honor or disgrace upon a young married woman she will be an inevitable sharer in that degree of respect or contempt which her chosen friend possesses in the esteem of the world and though its censures may sometimes involve the innocent with the guilty yet in general there is no fairer way of forming our opinions of persons we do not know than from their intimate associates  there is something still more alarming to be dreaded for a young woman who is thoughtless enough to form indiscriminate friendships there is a lightness of mind and manners in many women who though free from actual vice have lost that delicate sensibility which heaven has placed in female minds as the outguard of modesty the rosy blush that gives the intuitive alarm to decency even before the perceptions of the mind are awake to danger glows not upon their cheek the snowy purity of innocence beams not upon their dauntless forehead though it may still retain its whiteness their minds may be coarse however delicate their form and their manners unfeminine even without being masculine  an intimacy with such persons is of all others the most dangerous the frankness and liveliness of their conversation render them too generally agreeable and they frequently undermine the principles of virtue before we find it necessary to stand upon our guard  as the platonic system has been long exploded it is almost unnecessary to warn my fair readers against particular intimacies with the other sex when not closely connected with them by the ties of blood or affinity the whole system of nature must change and the tiger and the lamb live peaceably together before a sincere and disinterested friendship can subsist between an amiable young woman and a man not nearly related to her who has not passed his grand climacteric a man of such an age possessed of sense and virtue may perhaps be a kind and useful mentor but if a married woman is happy enough to meet with a proper and affectionate return from the first object i have recommended to her choice she cannot stand in need of any other friend  parental and filial affection parental affection seems to be so perfectly instinctive that when any unhappy object appears to be deficient in this natural sentiment i consider such a person as one who has been unfortunately born deaf or blind that is in a state of deprivation of some of those faculties which providence has been graciously pleased to render inherent in our nature in its perfect formation  if milton deplored the loss of sight as shutting knowledge at one entrance out with how much more reason may they who are insensible to the fond and tender sensations of parental love lament that the fairest page in natures volume the infant mind appears to them a blank and transports such as parents only feel from their cold hearts for evermore shut out  that every species of animals have sometimes produced monsters is certain but by the goodness of providence they are few in number when compared with the happy multitudes who are perfect in their several orders of existence it is therefore unnecessary to pursue this painful idea further so that i shall only add to the honor of england that an unfeeling parent is among us a character almost as singular as detestable  but as affection in its natural progression rather descends than ascends we sometimes see instances of deficiency in the returns of filial affection to parental love whenever this failure appears in persons of otherwise good and amiable dispositions i am inclined to believe that there must have been something peculiarly wrong in the bias of their education or the conduct of their parents toward them for in a state of infancy every child must naturally love its parents they are the first objects which awaken in us the ideas of power and kindness of a power that enables and a kindness that prompts to supply all our little wants and to soothe and alleviate all our pains and distresses long before we are able to develope these ideas they naturally produce the almost instinctive sensations of reverence gratitude and love these happy feelings of a virtuous mind grow with our growth and strengthen with our strength till sensation becomes sentiment which can never be totally eradicated though it may sometimes be restrained or even overborne for a while by some particular species of unkindness severity or injustice  but though the sentiments of filial affection are so natural to every good heart that sovereign power which formed us and knows whereof we are made has thought proper to command the exertion of this virtue in its fullest extent by the emphatic term of honor thy father and thy mother and has been graciously pleased to add the promise of length of days to those who fulfill this law  when the ties of natural affection are thus enforced by the divine sanction it appears almost impossible that any casualty should dissolve this double band or that it should even be weakened by any other attachment  the union which is formed by wedded love can never slacken or abate its strength for in liberal minds the increase of happiness like the suns beams upon a fertile soil calls every virtue forth the tender charities which gladden life are ripened and matured beneath its influence while the flowers of connubial fondness bloom fairest and are sweetest to the sense when they grow on the rich stem of filial love and a husband must be either weak or tyrannic who does not rejoice in the kindness and attention of his wife to those who have been early and are nearly connected with her  family attachments have this advantage over all others that they are not subject to satiety parental fondness is augmented by the growth and expansion of every charm and merit in a child and as it naturally happens that the parents begin to decline when the children have arrived at their zenith reverence for their age and gratitude for their kindness combined with the tender apprehension of losing them add strength to our former affectionate feelings and awaken that almost divine enthusiasm which inspired popes filial prayer  me let the tender office long engage  to rock the cradle of declining age  explore the thought explain the asking eye  and keep awhile a parent from the sky   the proportions of our affection and esteem must necessarily because naturally be limited by the respective merits of the persons on whom they are conferred reason admits not of superstitious attachments in point of sentiment but no demerit in a parent can absolve a child from that duty which has the double sanction both of god and nature how truly are they to be pitied who either from their own or their parents defects are unhappily rendered insensible to the virtuous transport of giving joy to those who gave them being who incapable of the pleasing alacrity arising from filial affection fulfill the requests or wishes of a parent with the same reluctant coldness that they would execute the commands of a severe master  parental authority is certainly abrogated by that of a husband  we cannot serve two masters but we can love a father and a husband a mother and a son with as pure and unmixed affection as if our whole heart was devoted to any one of these individuals family connections so far from being dissolved by marriage are rather strengthened by the addition of a new member and should continue to hold the first place in the society of a young married woman if she is so happy as to approve and be approved by her husbands family her love for him will incorporate them in her esteem with her own she will naturally become the center of their mutual attachments and regard while her amiable and endearing influence extending to each individual shall unite them all in one complete and happy circle  economy this is a subject which depends so entirely upon circumstances that like the cameleon it must necessarily take its hue from the surrounding objects but though obliged to vary its appearance from its different situations it has still some fixed and determinate principles which constitute its essence and preserve its name in every condition of life economy may be compared to an isthmus placed between a continent and a peninsula between profusion and parsimony bearing equal relation to both it is a line drawn by the hand of reason upon the human mind to restrain the thoughtless excess of extravagance too often miscalled generosity and at the same time to set bounds to the meanest of all vices avarice  neither rank nor riches can place any person above economy and perhaps those who possess such advantages in the highest degree have the greatest occasion for the practice of this humble virtue  where much is given much is required as well in the literal as the figurative sense of the expression and when those who are blessed with affluence consider themselves as they are bound to do but as stewards for the poor they must surely reflect that dissipation and extravagance are not the use but the abuse of that store which has been thus entrusted to their care and that such misapplication cannot entitle them to fair acquittance from the great giver of all good  but were we to confine our views even to this dim spot we shall find that economy is in every situation of life a requisite and necessary duty incumbent on human nature they must be very young indeed who have not heard  of numbers once in fortunes lap highfed  who now solicit the cold hand of charity and what must then be the feelings of a generous heart which from its indolence or the vile indulgence of some fond caprice has become selfdeprived of that transcendant delight which angels share with men of wiping off the bitter tear of woe of soothing the afflicted heart and bidding peace and joy revisit the sad mansions of despair  economy is as perfectly inconsistent with avarice as with extravagance whenever it degenerates into penuriousness it ceases to be a virtue and appears even a less pardonable fault than its contrary extreme for extravagance may be prompted by generosity but selfishness can have no motive that is not mean economy is founded in that justice which we owe to others and in that proper respect which we owe to ourselves these principles happily united form the true source of liberality and independence  there is an economy of time too as well as of fortune which i would earnestly recommend a little attention to this very important article would serve to lighten that sad load of which we often complain while yet with childish fondness we lament its flight perhaps unknowing that it is within our power to wing its speed or to arrest its course or perhaps still worse not reflecting that we shall be accountable for this rich this sacred deposit when time itself shall be no more  for the proper economy of this treasure one general rule is sufficient for all ranks and situations  employ your time  time wasted is existence used is life and every condition and stage of life has its necessary and peculiar employments  action is the great spring on which creation turns it is that preserves and harmonizes all even things inanimate trees plants and flowers obey the voice of nature and act in their own sphere unbidden they send forth their fruits and odours and pay their tribute to creations laws the elements themselves subsist by motion without its actuating spirit the earth no more could turn upon its axis the fire would be extinct and air and water stagnate to putrefaction shall man alone the masterwork of heaven rust in dull indolence and sinking in enervate sloth debase his nature beneath the trodden clod formed to contemplate all the works of god to think upon the wonders of past times and raise his future hopes to an eternity   time is eternity  pregnant with all eternity can give  pregnant with all that makes archangels smile   who murders time he crushes in the birth  a power aetherial only not adored   no reasoning being can doubt but that the use or abuse of time must mark our future fate as we ourselves ordain  the spirit walks of each departed day  and smiles an angel or a fury frowns   but for a moment let us admit that conscience could be lulled to rest on beds of roses or that the waste of time might not be deemed a vice is there on earth a human being so lost to every sense of its own dignity as to acquiesce in bare existence and to look back upon the sum of that existence as a blank this last argument appears to me so fully sufficient to awaken that noble pride that true selfestimation which heaven has implanted in our souls for the great purpose of exalting our nature above the subordinate classes of animals who are debarred the glorious prerogative of looking forward with humble hope to an happy immortality that i should think any other incitement would be superfluous upon this subject which i shall therefore conclude with the interesting picture which the last author quoted above has given of those happy few who have made a right use of that treasure that heaven has been pleased to entrust them with  where shall i find him angels tell me where  your golden wings now hovering over him shed  protection now are waving in applause  to that blessed son of foresight lord of fate  that awful independent on tomorrow  whose work is done  who triumphs in the past  whose yesterdays look backwards with a smile  nor like the parthian wound him as they fly   conclusion as i have now though perhaps but faintly touched upon the duties most essential in the marriagestate it appears to me unnecessary to pursue this work any farther though i am certain there are many follies not to give them a harsher name incident to my sex which are not even glanced at in these essays the most glaring perhaps that has been left unnoticed is the universal spirit of dissipation which seems to reign among all ranks of women but though i have not particularly attacked this archdemon this greatest enemy to domestic happiness i hope i have in some degree undermined his batteries and sapped his intrenchments in the female heart at least i have offered to those who choose to accept them the powerful auxiliaries of religion conjugal affection and parental love to oppose his force and render them superior to his allurements for those who serve under the banner of these mild virtues will never fall a prey to the tyrannic power of vice however it may be supported by custom or adorned by the seductive arts of fashion  as these essays are meant to be generally useful it would be impossible to confine their precepts to any particular rank or situation of course there can be no rules laid down for the conduct of individuals under any peculiar circumstances and indeed the whole work may rather be considered as a sketch from which the intelligent mind may deduce inferences and make applications than as a regular plan to be diligently pursued  uncandid and unfavourable as the presenttimes may be deemed to moral literature and unequal as i may be thought to so arduous a subject as that i have undertaken i still presume to hope there is no critic so severe as to deny me the merit of meaning well though i may have fallen infinitely short of the real motive that prompted this publication which is to restore my fair countrywomen to that preeminence they formerly held over the rest of their sex through the known world and to bring back that glorious era when the epitaph of the lucas family characterised the whole british nation  all the brothers were valiant  and all the sisters virtuous   i have humbly presumed to lay this little work at the feet of our most amiable and gracious queen whose private virtues as a wife and mother add luster to her exalted rank and would adorn the throne of universal monarchy  finis
