isis an elegy  price sixpence  isis an elegy  written in the year      by mr mason       sophocles in antig london printed for r dodsley at tullys head in pall mall and sold by m cooper in paternoster row  mdccxlix  advertisement the following poem would never have appeared in print had not an interpolated copy of it published in a country newspaper scandalously misrepresented the principles of the author  isis far from her hallowed grot where mildly bright the pointed crystals shot their trembling light from dripping moss where sparkling dewdrops fell where coral glowed where twined the wreathed shell pale isis lay a willows lowly shade spread it is thin foliage over the pensive maid closed was her eye and from her heaving breast in careless folds loose flowed her zoneless vest while down her neck her vagrant tresses flow in all the awful negligence of woe her urn sustained her arm that sculptured vase where vulcans art had lavished all it is grace here full with life was heavntaught science seen known by the laurel wreath and musing mein there cloudcrownd fame here peace sedate and bland swelled the loud trump and waved the olive wand while solemn domes arched shades and vistas green at wellmarkd distance close the sacred scene on this the goddess cast an anxious look then dropped a tender tear and thus she spoke yes i could once with pleased attention trace the mimic charms of this prophetic vase then lift my head and with enraptured eyes view on yon plain the real glories rise yes isis often have thou rejoiced to lead thy liquid treasures over yon favorite mead often have thou stopped thy pearly car to gaze while every science nursed it is growing bays while every youth with fames strong impulse fired pressed to the goal and at the goal untird snatched each celestial wreath to bind his brow the muses graces virtues could bestow even now fond fancy leads thideal train and ranks her troops on memrys ample plain see the firm leaders of my patriot line see sidney raleigh hamden summers shine see hough superior to a tyrants doom smile at the menace of the slave of rome each soul whom truth could fire or virtue move each breast strong panting with it is countrys love all that to albion gave the heart or head that wisely counseled or that bravely bled all all appear on me they grateful smile the wellearnd prize of every virtuous toil to me with filial reverence they bring and hang fresh trophies over my honored spring ah i remember well yon beachen spray there addison first tuned his polished lay twas there great catos form first met his eye in all the pomp of freeborn majesty my son he cried observe this mein with awe in solemn lines the strong resemblance draw the piercing notes shall strike each british ear each british eye shall drop the patriot tear and roused to glory by the nervous strain each youth shall spurn at slavrys abject reign shall guard with catos zeal britannias laws and speak and act and bleed in freedoms cause the hero spoke the bard assenting bowed the lay to liberty and cato flowed while echo as she roved the vale along joined the strong cadence of his roman song but ah how stillness slept upon the ground how mute attention checked each rising sound scarce stole a breeze to wave the leafy spray scarce trilld sweet philomel her softest lay when lock walked musing forth even now i view majestic wisdom throned upon his brow view candor smile upon his modest cheek and from his eye all judgments radiance break twas here the sage his manly zeal expressed here stripped vain falsehood of her gaudy vest here truths collected beams first filled his mind ever long to burst in blessings on mankind ever long to show to reasons purged eye that natures first best gift was liberty proud of this wondrous son sublime i stood while louder surges swelled my rapid flood then vain as niobe exulting cried ilissus roll thy famed athenian tide though platos steps often marked thy neighboring glade though fair lycaeum lent it is awful shade though every academic green impressed it is image full on thy reflecting breast yet my pure stream shall boast as proud a name and britains isis flow with attic fame alas how changed where now that attic boast see gothic license rage over all my coast see hydra faction spread it is impious reign poison each breast and madden every brain hence frontless crowds that not content to fright the blushing cynthia from her throne of night blast the fair face of day and madly bold to freedoms foes infernal orgies hold to freedoms foes ah see the goblet crowned hear plausive shouts to freedoms foes resound the horrid notes my refluent waters daunt the echoes groan the dryads quit their haunt learning that once to all diffused her beam now sheds by stealth a partial private gleam in some lone cloisters melancholy shade where a firm few support her sickly head despised insulted by the barbarous train who scour like thracias moonstruck rout the plain sworn foes like them to all the muse approves all phoebus favors or minerva loves are these the sons my fostring breast must rear graced with my name and nurtured by my care must these go forth from my maternal hand to deal their insults through a peaceful land and boast while freedom bleeds and virtue groans that  isis taught rebellion to her sons forbid it heaven and let my rising waves indignant swell and whelm the recreant slaves in englands cause their patriot floods employ as xanthus deluged in the cause of troy is this denied then point some secret way where far far hence these guiltless streams may stray some unknown channel lend where nature spreads inglorious vales and unfrequented meads there where a hind scarce tunes his rustic strain where scarce a pilgrim treads the pathless plain content i will flow forget that ever my tide saw yon majesty structures crown its side forget that ever my wrapped attention hung or on the sages or the poets tongue calm and resigned my humbler lot embrace and pleased prefer oblivion to disgrace finis
