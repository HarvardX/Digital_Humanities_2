an excursion to brighthelmstone made in the year      by henry wigstead and thomas rowlandson  dedicated by permission to his royal highness the prince of wales  embellished with eight engravings in aqua tinta from views taken on the road to and at that place  london printed with the types of stephensons british letterfoundry for g g j and j robinson paternosterrow  mdccxc  introduction the following descriptive account of an excursion to brighthelmstone is intended to give those who have not visited that delightfully situated town and its environs an idea of the pleasures with which a lively and feeling mind will be impressed on viewing those scenes which the authors have endeavored to illustrate  brighthelmstone  formerly an insignificant village is now become highly interesting on several accounts  the purity of the air the evervarying prospect of the sea the excellent accommodations for strangers and the acknowledged superiority of the bathing machines  these and many other considerations will always have a powerful influence on persons of true taste  but when we also consider that a personage as remarkable for generosity and affability and as distinguished for discerning and rewarding merit as he is exalted by his birth has fixed upon this cheerful and salubrious spot for his summer residence we are not surprised at seeing a multitude of persons of both sexes the pride and admiration of britain following the royal visitor to the english baiae of the roads which lead to brighthelmstone that immediately from london being most frequented the authors have endeavored to familiarize it to the traveller by the pen and pencil  the various scenes which are introduced are slightly represented and intended merely to impress the mind with the general effects of nature  it is in short a conversation narrative illustrated occasionally with sketches of those scenes and incidents which seemed most worthy of notice  an excursion to brighthelmstone crossing the thames over westminsterbridge we entered the county of surry  of which we think it necessary to prefix a general but concise description  surry is terminated on the west by hampshire on the south by sussex on the east by kent and on the north by the river thames  it is    miles in length from rotherhithe in the east to trensham in the west and    miles in breadth from the thames in the north to awfold in the south and     miles in circumference it contains   0 square miles or about     000 acres near    00 houses    hundreds   0 parishes    market towns   0 villages and hamlets and about    000 inhabitants   in this county are several royal palaces and a great number of noblemen and gentlemens villas  the air and the soil in the interior parts are very different from what they are at the extremities  on the borders the air is mild and healthy and the soil fertile in corn and hay with a proportion of woodland  especially in the south about holmsdale and in the north near the thames but in the interior parts the air is bleak and the soil in general sandy and sterile  the principal rivers which abound with fish are exclusive of the thames the mole the wey and the wandle the mole which rises in the south east of the county obtained its name from its sinking in the earth at the foot of boxhill and after having run under ground for two miles emerging again at leatherhead from whence it continues its course northwards and falls into the thames at a village called moulsey the wey enters this county from hampshire near farnham and runs eastward to godalming there turning to the north it becomes navigable to weybridge where it falls into the thames  the wandle rises near carshalton and runs with a clear though small stream famous for trout by mertonabbey to wandsworth where it falls into the thames  the first place that deserves notice after we had passed westminsterbridge was kennington a village near lambeth and one of the eight precincts of that parish  on the common of the same name a temporary gibbet is frequently erected for the execution of criminals in the county of surry  about   miles farther and   miles and a half from london is clapham a very agreeable village  on the adjacent common are many neat and pleasantly situated houses chiefly inhabited by citizens who enjoy a pure country air at a convenient distance from the center of business london  here a handsome church was built in      by the contribution of the parishioners a schoolhouse also was formerly built for the education of poor children  passing through ballam situated about one mile beyond clapham and proceeding rather more than a mile beyond we arrived at uppertooting a delightful village  there is however besides its situation nothing remarkable in it except an almshouse built in   0  by the mother of sir john bateman lord mayor of london for the reception of six poor women to be nominated by the heir of the family  sutton   about a mile and a half south east is lower tooting not worthy of particular notice  not far from uppertooting at a village called martin or merton kenulph king of the west saxons was murdered in the house of a lady whom he tenderly loved  it is also celebrated for a stately abbey erected here by henry the first for the reception of canons of the order of st augustine part of the walls remain but very insufficient to convey an idea of its ancient magnificence  pursuing our journey  about   miles beyond lowertooting we arrived at mitcham a well inhabited village and extremely well situated  the following anecdote curious in its circumstances we hope will not be misplaced  one h smith who by the occupation of a silversmith in london had acquired a considerable fortune formed the strange resolution of spending the remainder of his days as a common beggar he confined his limits to the county of surry where he was known by the appellation of dog smith but having given offense to an inhabitant of this town he was by a justice of the peace ordered to be publicly whipped this he resented so much that he left at his death fifty pounds a year or one thousand pounds in money to every market town in the county  mitcham excepted  here is a fair on the   th of august for cattle toys etc  sutton     miles from london is the first post stage  the cock kept by fuller is an excellent inn where the traveller may be supplied with good chaises and able horses  this village is very pleasantly situated and the air is no pure and healthy that with the additional inducement of eating the celebrated bansteaddown mutton many of the citizens of london resort here on sundays    proceeding over waltonheath about   miles beyond sutton we came to reigatehill a remarkably bold elevation from whence is a delightful prospect of the south downs in sussex but near the road which is scoopd out of the hill the declivity is so steep and abrupt that the spectator cannot help being struck with terror though softened by admiration  the sublime and the beautiful are here perfectly united imagination is fully exercised and the mind delighted  reigate the second post stage is    miles from london  it is situated in the vale of holmsdale and beautifully surrounded with hills is an ancient borough by prescription and is governed by a bailiff chosen annually at the manor court  here is a handsome church a charity school and a market house this last was formerly a chapel dedicated to thomas a becket  there are also some inconsiderable remains of a very ancient castle in one of the apartments of which the barons who were in arms against king john are said to have held their private meetings  at the whitehart the traveller is certain of meeting with every accommodation he can wish good posthorses an excellent larder genuine wines etc which have rendered mrs sully worthy the encouragement she meets with  his royal highness the prince of wales in his excursions to brighthelmstone frequently dines here  a fair is held at reigate on whitmonday and another on the   th of september  in the reign of king henry the third william warren earl of surry founded a priory of black canons at the bottom of a hill adjoining to reigate which is now a dwelling house  near reigate are two boroughs gatton and blechingley  each of which sends two members to parliament  gatton is a borough by prescription near which place some roman coins have been found  blechingley has nothing particularly remarkable  we therefore proceeded on our journey till we arrived on the borders of sussex of which county it may not be improper before we enter it to give a short description  the name of sussex is derived from a word which signified the county of the south saxons it is terminated on the north by surry on the east and north east by kent on the south by the british channel and on the west by hampshire its length is    miles its breadth    and its circumference     containing      square miles divided into   rapes or laths to each of which there formerly belonged a castle a river and a forest  it is besides subdivided into    hundreds which include     parishes   city    market towns  0   villages and hamlets and has      0 houses  the air of this county is in general wholesome though to strangers it is sometimes productive of agues in the north parts it is rather foggy but healthy and upon the downs it is remarkably pure the hilly parts are naturally less fertile than the others but the vales and especially the weald are highly productive  the south downs from whence is a beautiful prospect are generally covered with sheep remarkable for the fineness of their wool a great quantity of which is too often clandestinely smuggled into france notwithstanding the attention of the legislature to this great object to the great injury of the british woollen manufactures the middle part of the county is beautifully interspersed with meadows pasture grounds woods and corn fields the last of which produce great abundance of wheat and barley the north part abounds in woods which furnish the dockyards with large quantities of valuable timber and supply the ironworks in the eastern part of the county with charcoal  the principal rivers are the arun the adur the ouse and the rother the smaller rivers are the lavant the cuchmeer the ashburn and the astem sussex is in the province of canterbury and in the diocese of chichester  crawley     miles from london is the first town in sussex which we visited but not meeting any thing here particularly worthy of notice continued our route till we arrived at cuckfield   0 miles distant from london  here a fair is held in september resorted to by a great number of pretty rustic females and by a multitude of happy swains  from cuckfield to brighthelmstone about    miles distant the country is cheerful and the prospects various and extensive  preston    mile from brighthelmstone is a beautiful spot adorned with a great number of venerable elms prestonhouse is said to have been the residence of anne of cleves consort to henry the eighth from hence she retired to a convent at falmer about   miles distant where she died and was buried  from hence the bending sky is seen at an immeasurable distance meeting the surface of the ocean and forming the grand curve of the sensible horizon  from the great number of human bones which have been dug up in the neighborhood of brighthelmstone we may naturally suppose it to have been the scene of some great battle and as the coast of sussex was certainly the place where the belgians often landed and at last effected a settlement there is no doubt but the ancient britons had frequent disputes with them and that many battles were fought one of which probably might have been near this town  in the reign of queen elizabeth when the kingdom was threatened with an invasion from spain this was thought a place of importance and there are yet remains of a wall near the sea which seems to have been erected about that time  when charles the second escaped from the battle of worcester he wandered through different parts of the kingdom seeking an opportunity to escape to france and coming to this place attended by lord wilmot and a few other faithful friends so disguised that without being known by any of the inhabitants he was by means of a fishing boat safely landed in france  julius caesar is said to have landed here in one of his expeditions against britain      a great number of druidical monuments and altars have been discovered in this neighborhood  brighthelmstone one of the most southern towns in the county of sussex is situated in a bay terminated by beachyhead on the east and by worthingpoint on the west the stein at brighthelmstone is most beautifully situated three sides of it are formed by very neat and convenient lodginghouses etc  the fourth is open to the sea the rising downs behind are a shelter and ornament the white cliffs are seen trending to the east as far as seaforth and on the west the eye ranges over the liquid expanse and reaches portsdownhill spithead the eastern part of the isle of wight etc  the marine pavilion of his royal highness the prince of wales on the west side of the stein is a striking object and is admirably calculated for the summer residence of the royal personage for whom it was built and whose munificence and affability endear him to all who are not biassed by party blinded by prejudice or hostile to dignified merit this pavilion correctly designed and elegantly executed was begun and completed in five months  the furniture is adapted with great taste to the style of the building the grand saloon is beautifully decorated with paintings by rebecca executed in his best manner the toul ensemble of the building is in short perfect harmony the whole was executed by mr holland under the immediate inspection and direction of mr weltjie whose attachment to his royal master was faithful and disinterested the stables belonging to his royal highness are built in a style of convenient simplicity correspondent with that of the other buildings  the bathing machines are under the care of the attentive smoaker the number of beautiful women who every morning court the embraces of the watery god far exceeds that of any other bathing place in the kingdom    the market is plentifully stocked with all kinds of excellent provisions and culinary vegetables at a very reasonable price  the theater is situated in northstreet the company of actors is in general very respectable most of the favorite dramatic pieces selected from the london theaters are performed in the course of the season with great propriety  there are two excellent libraries on the stein kept by messrs crauford and dulot also a good printshop by mrs lay which with miss curries shop in northstreet are the places of polite resort from the various and excellent assortments of useful and ornamental commodities at the above places selections are frequently made for a raffle  a good band of music plays on the stein for some time twice a day  the lovely throng of females in all the elegance of a light summers dress woven in fancys loom who here suffer the sea breezes to riot on their charms is exceedingly numerous  in the town is a hot and a cold bath  one mile out of town is an excellent chalybeate spring possessing all the properties of the celebrated tunbridge waters  of lodginghouses those erected on the stein being most beautifully situated are consequently most expensive but there are others suitable to persons of all ranks and fortunes    at the rooms  whist and other clubs meet those who prefer dice may also enjoy their favorite amusement  the wheatears so called from a corrupted translation of the french cul blanc are taken in great numbers on the downs near brighthelmstone during the summer months  the race ground is exceedingly well adapted to the purpose for which it was intended and is one of the most beautifully situated spots in the world the prospect is wonderfully extensive and magnificent  the races are in july  there are always three fifties besides several sweepstakes matches etc a handsome and convenient stand sufficiently capacious to receive a great number of spectators is erected on the course  at a small distance from the race ground there was formerly a roman station now called whitehawke some vestages of which of a circular form are still visible  four miles east of brighthelmstone is a delightful village called rottingdeane it is situation on a cliff is remarkably bold and striking and at a convenient distance to receive the overflow of strangers from brighthelmstone who may here be accommodated with lodgings and bathing machines  the road which leads to this village over the downs is extremely pleasant and the prospect beautiful  the devils dyke formerly a roman encampment about   miles northwest of brighthelmstone is a wonderful situation  the prospect from hence is so very extensive that the eye takes in successively a circumference of  00 miles  comprehending a great number of spires towns and villages  at hoove  between brighthelmstone and new shoreham are the remains of a church which seems to have been originally a structure of great beauty and grandeur  new shoreham  about   miles from brighthelmstone westward is noted for shipbuilding in which art the inhabitants are allowed to excel  newhaven  about   miles east of brighthelmstone is situated at the mouth of the river ouse was formerly famous for its safe and commodious harbor which is now unfortunately choked up with mud and sand but we may expect that from the laudable exertions of the inhabitants of the town it will in time recover its former celebrity  finis
