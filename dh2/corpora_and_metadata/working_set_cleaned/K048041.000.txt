the cub at new market  price one shilling  the cub at new market a tale  london printed for r and j dodsley in pall mall mdcclxii  to his royal highness edward duke of york sir permit me to take this method of thanking your royal highness for condescending to like the following sketch or in other words permit me to let the world know that this same cub has been laughed at by the duke of york  has been read to your royal highness by the genius himself and warmed by the immediate beams of your kind indulgence  had i been able to conceal this i should have imagined that i had not the least spark of the enthusiasm of parnassus in my composition  to be so deficient in vanity which if i am not mistaken may be reckoned an inseparable characteristic of a poet  this trifle sir would not presume to interrupt you when engaged in matters of consequence it only begs leave to pay it is respects in an hour devoted to cheerful festivity  i wish your royal highness a long a merry and a happy life and am  your obliged devoted servant  preface this tale is  what very few tales nowadays are  true the hero of it no other than the author himself it was indeed catching the merriment as it rose for it was written in the new market coffee room  in which the author being elected a member of the jockey club had the happiness of passing several sprightly goodhumoured evenings  just when the whimsical adventure happened which is here related  poetical license however and is it not right that it should be so has been taken particularly in justice to my own person i must declare that a certain figure of speech called by rhetoricians hyperbole or exaggeration has been made pretty free with  my reasons for publishing it are twofold one is my own the other i borrowed from lord shaftesbury the former is without flattery the merit of the poem heyday  to be sure  why this is impudence without a parallel says some don choleric or another  i cannot agree with you there sir testy  pardon me sir  hear my explanation these verses have had the honor of being approved by those whose taste it would be the highest arrogance in me to call in question now sir what have you to say to that  the latter is in order to let my friends have copies of it which they may be in no danger of not being able to read and surely i may be rather excused for making the press my amanuensis than the noble lord who might have had half a dozen secretaries at his command if i have not already said enough fifty other reasons may be invented by my ingenious readers  and now for the critics  pray good gentlemen be quiet do not apply your confounded squares and compasses to a performance whose beauty  if it has any  but that you know is understood  consists in a careless ease what have your grave countenances to do here  it is not at all becoming in people of your dignity and consequence to keep company with cubs what the deuce cannot a comical fellow take a hearty laugh but one of you sage philosophers must clap on a pair of damnation spectacles and stare him full in the face in order to find out pimples upon his nose  commend me however as much as you please take full scope there and for your further encouragement if you will tickle my fancy with a few obliging encomiums i promise you a scotchpintbottle of mine excellent host at the bedfordhead wildmans best claret which by the by has been facetiously reckoned no ineffectual bribe to one formidable bashaw amongst you  jesting apart my dear boy cub go along  push thy way  shift for thyself all that is required of thee is to relax the muscles of such as have not got these organs of risibility over and above constricted  play thy part well and rest assured of eternal applause from thy loving progenitor  the cub at new market poets for most part have been poor experience tells us  proof too sure ay may be so lord rich exclaims who fortunes will incessant blames it may be so but yet confound em they still have jollity around em

mountains newly caught and after driving him about through london many a different rout the comic episodes of which would tire your lordships patience each new market meeting being near he thought twas best to have him there and that your time i may not consume view him in the new coffeeroom there soon his noble patron gay flies to his sportive friends away while the poor being hums a song astonished to behold a throng of dukes and lords  bless me he thought enchantment surely here has wrought sometimes stockstill he stood amazed and with a stupid wonder gazed admired at every thing he saw even spurs would his attention draw much more militia colnels great the bulwarks of britannias state whose strut majestic made him shrink as on a promontorys brink in short size color voice and shape made our prodigious hero gape such charms in novelty we find such it is effect on every mind sometimes he with an awkard stride would lift his legs from side to side while stars reflecting phoebus light with beamy radiance struck his sight then as his visive orbs grew dim began to think some looked at him and bashfulness he knew not why brought tears into his sheepish eye what could the luckless fellow do for not a single soul he knew at last a corner pure and snug he chanced to spy which made him hug himself with joy  there down he sat of solitude fond as a bat and like a man at point of death scarcely squeezed forth above his breath here get me paper pen and ink for waiter i will write i think and now my story pause awhile till i in hudibrastic style attempt to give you as i can the portraiture of this wild man he was not of the iron race which sometimes calidonia grace though he to combat could advance  plumpness shone in his countenance and belly prominent declared that he for beef and pudding cared he had a large and ponderous head that seemed to be composed of lead from which hung down such stiff lank hair as might the crows in autumn scare two hours thus studious past or more afraid to venture on the floor he rather thought on something new nor dreamt he any notice drew sedley a truly worthy knight in whom strong sense quick parts unite whose humor of peculiar cast surprises you from first to last who though few really are more wise to look a little foolish tries and likes exotics to discover as a fine lady a new lover to the consounded put comes near tips him at once a friendly leer and thus accosts him how now squire why you have already wrote a quire yet still continue to go on what will your labors never be done it is said that you and eglintoun our history are handing down no doubt twill be a work complete all former authors will be beat out with proposals  for my share i will instantly subscribe i swear just in the moment as he spoke the

dedication and i who have a knack that way will whistle notes to what you say nay more in attitude burlesque will draw the the caliban  an appellation sometimes merrily bestowed on a very sensible worthy member who loves a jest himself and who admires the equitable practice of give and take caliban grotesque who in the frontispiece shall stand and ludicrous your mirth command this last design was scarcely broached when lo the monster fell approached the justice in one arm he lugs and the thin spectre onward tugs our clown like country mouse of old bout which in horace we are told quaked timid as with horrid grin he saw him shake his triple chin the affrighted animal would skulk and hide him from the enormous bulk you will easily believe my lord that this could no small fun afford and set  nay call me not queer dog  their gelasticity agog at first the circle held but few till as the loud laugh stronger grew dukes lords and commons fondly joined eager the mighty joke to find not one of em a sentence spoke with peals of laughter like to choke each as he came the infection seized and by his friend behind was teased with what is the matter  all at once the friend behind turns equal dunce in short the hounds when in full cry never struck with so much force the sky as this blithe chorus did assault the coffeerooms resounding vault meantime sir charles who seemed to pry into the jest with aspect sly his visage veiling with a gloom slipped to the middle of the room pulled half a dozen by the sleeve and whispered each you may believe i am forced to tell you what is true why

sadness out of door from whence that folly is at least harmless i think should be confessed and that in life it may be well sometimes to hunt the bagatelle likewise we see that fate never fails to weigh things in impartial scales for though some people are more blessed with understanding than the rest she some external oddity bestows which they themselves cannot see or some particular defect which while they indolent neglect to mortals of inferior sort in harmless satire serves for sport thus is the balance rendered even here view the equity of heaven finis
