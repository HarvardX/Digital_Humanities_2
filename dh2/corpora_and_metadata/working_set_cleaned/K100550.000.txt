oerwhelmn them  shakespeare london printed and sold by w reeve in fleet street m dcc lv  an account of barbarossa the usurper of algiers as the curiosity of the public has been of late much engaged in enquiries after the new tragedy of barbarossa which is soon to be performed at the theater royal in drury lane and as several gentlemen of eminence in the republic of letters have been mentioned as the author it may perhaps be agreeable to the town to have the following short account given of the previous history of that famed usurper from whom the tragedy takes it is name  while the memorable cardinal ximenez was minister in spain king ferdinand the fifth of arragon about the year   0  sent peter count of navarre with a powerful force which without difficulty took oran the inhabitants of this famous city in general were moors which had been forced out of granada and valentia about twelve years before  these being a bold and active people and being well versed in the manners as well as language of the spaniards did considerable damage both by sea and land to the dependents of that crown  from oran the spaniards flushed with success pursued their conquest and took bugia and many other places with heroic valor the algerines being apprehensive their city would undergo the same fate sent for assistance by way of caution to selim eutemi a prince of arabian extraction famous for skill in military affairs he accepted their invitation and came with a large number of valiant followers which he had selected from that populous nation and encamped upon the plain of mutija where he had power attended also by his wife zaphira a lady of great worth and virtue and his son selim not then twelve years old whom he was fond of initiating into the exercise of war  notwithstanding this succor another fleet and more troops from ferdinand quickly subdued the city of algiers and obliged it to pay tribute and even suffered the spaniards to build a fort and man it with some of the best troops on a small island that lay opposite the city to the great injury of the algerine corsairs who could not with safety go out and in the harbor  this however disagreeable they bore with patience till the death of ferdinand in the year      which put them then upon an attempt to recover their liberties  they sent deputies to arach barbarossa a mohammedan corsair born at mcteline in the archipelago of great fame for his bravery and his success in battle he was upon a cruise with his squardron when the algerine deputies met him with their request to assist them to throw off the spanish yoke promising him great dignities to his person and large gratification for such service he gave the deputies a most favorable answer and sent them back to algiers to carry joy to their dejected countrymen  barbarossa immediately sent eighteen galleys and a number of barks to algiers while he marched by land collecting all the moors and turks that seemed inclined to assist his enterprise and was so successful in his levies that the algerines thought the hour of deliverance was at hand  selim eutemi general of algiers with many of the chief officers and principal citizens went two days journey to meet him and brought him with great honors in triumph into their city conducting him amidst the shouts of the people to the palace of selim eutemi where he was nobly received while his army met with great indulgence from the rejoiced algerines which they soon abused and claimed by force what was first given them through courtesy  barbarossa too being of an ambitious nature formed a wicked design of making himself sovereign of algiers and all its provinces his officers applauded his design promised to assist in it and swore themselves to secrecy till a time happened to put it in execution in order to begin commotions barbarossa winked at the insolence and villainies of the turkish soldiers who were perpetually raising disorders in the city which he hoped might enrage the citizens to some desperate act that might favor his design  selim eutemi now discovered his indiscretion in calling barbarossa in to his assistance for so insolent was this pirate that he treated the prince with contempt never asking his advice in any thing but built forts attacked the spanish castle and all without his knowledge or consent  the citizens too plainly perceived his design and made no scruple of declaring their sentiments barbarossa finding himself suspected gave way to his fury which was heightened by a passion he had entertained for selims wife the fair zaphira he therefore determined to make short work of it and by the death of selim satisfy at once his ambition and his love for he did not doubt but upon her husbands death zaphira would listen to his suit and consent to marry him which alliance would add dignity to him and his own mean extraction be hid by the union with this lady who was related to most of the powerful cheques of the arabians who if the algerines should oppose would for his wifes sake assist to establish him upon the throne  barbarossa having fixed his scheme waited an opportunity of selims being alone in a bath when he rushed upon him and slew him he fell down in the bath where the water finished what his hurry had imperfectly done the pirate hastened out and collecting some of his friends returned to the bath under pretense of cooling himself as usual where with an affected surprise he showed selim dead this was soon spread throughout the city and barbarossa under pretense of discovering any foul play that might have been used to selim put all the soldiers under arms with orders to secure every pass till he could consider further on this accident  the citizens of algiers notwithstanding the reports given out looked upon the death of selim to be a stroke of the inhuman barbarossas and dreading the further mischief they suspected he had pland locked themselves in their houses which gave the turkish army full power to distress and spoil at pleasure  they immediately conducted barbarossa in pomp to selims palace proclaiming him king of algiers adding destruction to all opposers of him that heaven has chosen for our deliverer and protector  these menaces alarmed the citizens with most dreadful apprehensions barbarossa was seated under a canopy surrounded with his adherents and guards while proper officers were sent to the principal inhabitants requiring them in the name of the new king to attend and take the oath of allegiance before him promising great marks of favor and rewards to those who showed themselves most ready to perform the ceremony in this exigency the citizens who apprehended immediate death would follow their refusal suffered themselves to be brought to the palace where after the king had repeated his magnificent promises they took the oaths and signed the instrument for his coronation  barbarossa having thus far obtained his end ordered the inhabitants to go quietly about their several callings and depend upon his care for their protection prince selims son with reason apprehending he was not long to survive his fathers murder found means to fly with only two servants to oran and beg protection from spain the marquis de gomarez governor of the place received him with all the respect and honor due to his birth and youth  barbarossa being thus settled on the throne caused all the fortifications of algiers to be repaired and placed in them strong garrisons of turkish soldiers whom he paid well with money he had coined in his own name  the people soon felt the grievances of barbarossas usurpation for where he had the least suspicion he seized upon the effects of the subjects others that had secreted their money were put to death while he and his associates revelld in their property  while affairs were in this situation barbarossa began his addresses to the princess zaphira who rejected them with the utmost disdain for she looked upon him as the murderer of her husband and expecting her contempt of him would enrage him to attempt some violence she always carried a dagger with her fully resolved if she could not revenge herself on him to save her virtue at the price of her own life  barbarossa however furious by nature did not immediately resent zaphiras behavior but looking on her excessive grief to proceed from her husbands death resolved to forbear his visits for awhile and let time restore her mind to temper when he did not doubt but to persuade her to share his crown  he made her a present of some beautiful slaves some of which were instructed to let him know what passed in the princesss apartment  zaphiras grief was too violent to continue and her transports began to settle into a composed and silent sorrow reflection took place and finding it impossible to revenge the death of selim she resolved to request the usurper to let her retire into her own country  barbarossa hearing the princess was grown more moderate in her grief sent her a letter full of the highest praises of her beauty and the adoration he paid to it offering to share his crown with her and beseeching her to forget all former miseries and rise to joy upon the throne he wished her to adorn  one of the slaves that barbarossa had presented the princess with was entrusted to deliver this letter to her but what was her surprise when she read these offers made by one who was the murderer of her husband all her former agitations were renewed but at length a little recollecting herself she consulted with her faithful women how to behave in such a dreadful exigency it was now resolved that she should send a soothing answer back as rage would prove vain against power and by flattering the tyrant obtain permission to retire to the plains of mutija her native country and urge for reason of her refusing the crown her detestatio of the place where her lord was murdered  barbarossa found by this epistle that she suspected him as accessory to selims death but in order to clear himself and put an end to zaphiras imaginations he summoned his chief counselor and instrument in the death of selim ramadan choulah and told him as the princess suspected he was concerned in the princes murder that in order to acquit himself he must procure some victims to turn zaphiras thoughts  ramadan easily came into this project and ordered it to be proclaimed that the king being informed that selim had a violent death and that he himself was suspected to be privy to it his orders were that any person who knew or suspected the murderers should immediately discover them on pain of death and tortures promising at the same time great rewards to the informer  it was not long before an informer who had been practiced upon made a discovery he declared that a domestic of prince selims had told him before he left algiers the names of the accomplices adding that they were under an oath to suffer death rather than betray the secret if barbarossa had miscarried but that he being at present the sovereign they had nothing to fear though it should be publicly known this wretch who was in the princes service received the reward but at the same time the king ordered his tongue to be pulled out under pretense of his not revealing it sooner but indeed that he might not discover the treachery  the pretended accomplices to the number of thirty were brought before the king who were some of the poorest soldiers in barbarossas army and had been wrought upon by ramadan in order to clear the king publicly to consess themselves guilty assuring them of great rewards for the service and though they should be put in prison yet means should be found to convey them safe to egypt to spend their lives in peace and plenty  these poor men could not resist such promises but consented and when they were called upon answered to every question and owned their guilt upon which they were immediately strangled one of them out of revenge to ramadan who had so deluded them cried out before he died that prince selim was murdered by the order of ramadan whom the king ordered that instant to meet the same fate the other wretches had suffered thus did this wicked man fall by his own contrivance and was destroyed by that power which he had been the chief instrument to establish  barbarossa had the bodies of these wretches dragged round the city and their heads fixed upon the battlements of the palace and did not doubt but the confessions of these criminals would convince zaphira as well as all the citizens that he was innocent of prince selims death and indeed many acquitted him of being any ways concerned in the murder  with this assurance he sent again to the princess again invited her to his throne and pleaded as some merit the discovery he had made of selims murderers and the justice he had executed upon them  but zaphira was too penetrating to be so deceived she again refused his offers adding his power could not bestow any thing worth her acceptance unless it was the liberty of retiring to her own country  this intercourse of assiduous courtship and steady refusal continued by fits for some years during which time barbarossa was frequently called from algiers by his ambition in defending the territories he had usurped and enlarging them by new conquests in the mean time having got notice that young selim had taken refuge in oran he secretly dispatched a bold assassin who should destroy the young prince whom he regarded as the greatest obstacle to his safe possession of the throne  while this design was in agitation he returned triumphant over his enemies to algiers and being at once tired and provoked with zaphiras repeated delays he now bethought himself of using that power he was possessed of and resolved in case of another refusal to compel her to a marriage  somewhere about this period if ou accounts are true the tragedy begins how the poet may conduct his plan or what use he may make of these materials we presume not to conjecture nor indeed if we were acquainted with his design would we anticipate the spectators pleasure by making it public  but by the policy of the managers the conduct of this tragedy is as much a secret as either the name of the author or the subsequent part of the history itself  finis
