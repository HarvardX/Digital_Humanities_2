your medical extracts first drew my attention to the subject of pneumatic medicine which i have pursued with the greatest satisfaction to myself and i trust as these pages will show with some advantage to others to you sir is the world at large indebted for an extensive application of the factitious airs which only want time and the exercise of your talents to render them as universal as they are beneficial independent of this work the assistance i have derived from your letters to dr beddoes and the information acquired at your house by the leave you gave me of seeing your different patients who were experiencing the benefits of your practice entitle you to my warmest acknowledgments to render these sentiments of my respect and gratitude as public as they are sincere is my only view in this address to say more or to assume the common language of dedication would be to a gentleman of your known diffidence and reputation as offensive as it would be useless  believe me to be

natura corporis cognoscenda est cic de orat an investigation of the nature and origin of scrophulous diseases the difficulties attending the treatment of scrophula although daily occurring in the practice of almost every medical man are so great that this disease is justly styled the opprobrium medicorum hence a variety of remedies have at different periods been recommended for this disease the hanging of vervainroot round the neck the surrounding the diseased parts with particular precious stones the stroaking the part with a dead persons hand and many similar acts are said by different persons to be specifics in the cure of struma white on scrophula in the earlier ages recourse was had to charms and the royal touch the term kings evil applied to scrophula arose from the pretensions which king edward surnamed the confessor professed to have in curing this disease by the touch and his example was followed by all the succeeding kings of both england and france but when these mortals were convinced of the absurdity of this practice they gave up this foolish pretension and when the idea prevailed of its being hereditary this appellation became very obnoxious and complaints of this kind have been most frequently called scrophulous from the latin word scrofula a sowpig from these animals being oftentimes affected with this disease but from the above circumstance of royal superstition and ignorance does it really owe its english appellation but the success attending these modes of cure is highly incredible and doubtless in a great measure to be attributed to a want of sufficient investigation which would enable us to ascertain the difference between those modifications of those diseases which are really scrophulous and those which depend upon some other constitutional affection  the perplexities of our profession which are glaringly manifest to every person the least conversant in it the trivial advantages which have accrued to it from the laborious efforts of medical writers the endless folios which have been written on the distinction and cure of diseases often more with a view of acquiring popularity and gain to their authors than of extending knowledge to which may be added the continual embarrassments and acknowledged difficulties attendant on the practice of medicine must have convinced us of this melancholy fact that we are traveling in a wilderness where there exist but faint glimmerings for extrication and where the prospect leads to despair  were it not that a new hope has arisen that from the happy industry of a few enlightened men the torch of chemical philosophy will finally conduct us through this labyrinth of error  no disease occasions more distress to the unhappy patient than the one in question and when we reflect for a moment how general a disease it is in this country and how many are cut off by its ravages who might otherwise have been ornaments in society it is somewhat surprising that more attention has not been bestowed to acquire a more certain and effectual mode of treatment of a malady of such a nature than that which is commonly employed  some practitioners have attempted to show that it is an hereditary disease and cannot be cured without some important change produced in the constitution mr white in his treatise on scrophula has refuted the arguments which have been brought forward in favor of this hereditary disposition in parents by saying that as no form age or sex are exempted from struma it cannot be considered then as an hereditary disease for my own part i deny the doctrine of hereditary diseases altogether for it is founded on a want of observation and has nothing to support it but obstinacy and prejudice a taint transmitted from parents to their offspring and celebrated under the appellation of hereditary says the learned doctor john brown elementinae medicinae  is a mere tale the sons of the rich who succeed to their fathers estate succeed also to his gout those who are excluded from his estate escape that disease unless they bring it on afterward by their own conduct this supposition makes the noxious powers superfluous which have been proved to be every thing respecting disease and as it is therefore nugatory and absurd so the truth of the latter opinion must be admitted even the learned doctor cullen has fallen into some mistakes respecting the doctrine of hereditary diseases he says scrophula is very commonly and very generally an hereditary disease and although it sometimes may happen yet this is very rare but in children whose parents had at some period of their lives been affected with it whether it may not fail to appear in the children of scrophulous parents and discover itself afterward in their offspring in the succeeding generation i cannot certainly determine but believe that this has frequently happened it appears to me to be more commonly derived from fathers than from mothers but whether this happens from there being more scrophulous men than women married i am not certain first lines of the practice of physic the stamina or simple solids are so given in our first conformation that some persons are distinguished by a rigid others by a slender state of the whole mass  this variety of the stamina if the exciting powers upon which the whole phenomenon of life depend be properly managed admits each its respective state of health suited to its respective nature and sufficiently good if the excitement by excitement is to be here understood the effect of the exciting powers acting upon the excitability which when of a proper degree constitute health but when excessive or diminished give a predisposition to disease and the formation of disease  suited to each be kept up by a proper direction of the stimuli  it very frequently happens in families that one child will have scrophula and all the rest be exempt from it now if this were an hereditary disease how could it be expected that any should escape i have heard if childrens having scrophulous tumors behind their ears and about the neck where it has been supposed that the variolous matter with which they were inoculated was taken from children in whom symptoms of that disease were very manifest and this led me once to form an opinion that scrophula might more frequently be conveyed into the constitution of the patient by inoculation than dependant upon any original affection but upon the authority of an eminent surgeon in this city who has tried in many different instances if struma were a communicable disease mr sutton is of opinion that neither inveterate strumas or venereal taints the most of all others to be dreaded have ever to his knowledge been communicated by the ordinary methods of inoculation although experiments have been made for the purpose of ascertaining this matter vide suttons inocuator and who is firmly of opinion that it is not i have totally relinquished that opinion  having rejected an hypothesis that has generally been advanced respecting the hereditary production of this disease i shall proceed on to consider the seat and causes of it by which we are alone enabled to form proper indications of cure  section i definition of scrophula scrophula is a weakened action in the system manifesting itself by the following diseases viz    scrophulous tumors and ulcers   phthisis pulmonalis   tabes scrophulosa   ophthalmia tarsi   hydarthus   bronchocele   hydrocephalus   lumbarabscess   rachitis section ii of scrophulous tumors and ulcers it will be unnecessary to give a long and tedious description of scrophulous tumors and ulcers since as the late mr hunter observes these are so characterized as to be easily distinguished from all others they begin at first generally in the neck affecting the conglobate glands the conglobate glands are also lymphatic as to their structure they are sometimes round at other times oval oblong or flat they vary in size sometimes as large as an acorn and at other times as small as peace their structure is made up of blood vessels lymphatic vessels nerves and cellular texture  the blood vessels are both arteries and veins in young subjects there is an appearance of an intermediate body containing a whitish liquor  they are principally supplied with nerves and lymphatics it appears from injection that in their inward surface they are cellular when many grow together they form a cluster or mass they are more numerous in the texture of the lungs or testicles in the neck bronchia intestines axilla under the fat above the inner condyle and along the dorsal vertebrae they are placed in situations of the body where they are ready and fit to receive pressure there is an excretion into their cells from the exhalent arteries when these glands in the mesentery are hardened or enlarged an atrophy usually follows alientery is also connected with the disease of these glands  feel hard are colorless and indolent in their progress such tumors in their commencement are rarely attended with pain or certainly not much the absorbed fluids in their course to the veins in scrophula are arrested in the lymphatic glands which swell and after a great length of time inflame and suppurate doctor darwin zoonomia vol   observes that these indolent tumors of the lymphaticglands which constitute scrophula originate from the inirritability of those glands which therefore sooner fall into torpor after having been stimulated too violently by some poisonous material as the muscles of enfeebled persons sooner become fatigued and cease to act when exerted than those of stronger ones on the same account these scrophulous glands are much larger in acquiring increase of motion after having been stimulated into activity and either remain years in a state of indolence or suppurate with difficulty and sometimes only partially  it has been noticed by doctor beddoes that scrophulous tumors arise from a deficiency of oxygene occasioning inirritability of the system and when we remark the sallow appearance of the countenance the slowness of the pulse and the torpor of the tumors in such patients we shall readily assent to this doctrine the tumors when they break occasion ulcers whose edges are pale and flabby and naturally disinclined to heal seldom yielding a good discharge at first they afford a viscid glairy and sometimes whitish curdly matter which afterward changes into a thin and aqueous sanies after continuing in this state for some length of time the edges of the sores become irregular and smooth sometimes however these are elevated and at other times are very flat when they are healed up quickly they soon break out upon some other parts of the body where there is local debility or in other words diminished action of the sensorial power for this reason it appears that vitalair by invigorating the system increasing the excitability both local and general and by keeping up a gentle and universal stimulus which pervades the whole frame very frequently have effected a cure when even all other remedies have failed  at a certain age that is between infancy and puberty these tumors sometimes disappear and ulcers have healed up spontaneously though very rarely  to discuss scrophulous tumors and heal scrophulous sores a variety of remedies have been extolled such as preparations of mercury both internally and externally solutions of cerus acetat aq veg min the bark tarwater and cicuta calomel vide mr whites treatise scrophula by acting as a stimulant and increasing the excitability of the system has been given in small doses with evident good effects and these would be augmented by inhaling at the same time oxygenegas  electricity as a topical remedy is spoken of in high terms by those who have applied it and i think i have in several instances seen it of service pressure but in no species of sore is compression either so evidently indicated or of so much real utility as in scrophulous ulcers in which that swelling and tumefaction which frequently raise their edges to very considerable heights often prove a greater hindrance to the cure than any other circumstances and which when no considerable inflammation occurs may always by gentle compression be easily and safely removed bell on ulcers p   0 beyond ease over the tumors is the best exciting power by assisting weak vessels and promoting absorption this will be all that is necessary to be done for such tumors before they break  when ulceration has taken place other remedies become necessary  among the foremost stands the woodsorrel oxalis acetosella mr crusoe an ingenious young surgeon at st bartholomews hospital to whom i am much indebted for many valuable communications on different subjects connected with the profession has assured me that he has applied the oxalis acctosella to other ulcers besides scrophulous with good effects  of which the reader may see a fuller account with a variety of cases in which it has been successfully employed by referring to beddoess considerations on the medicinal use of factitious airs pages       0     and     part iv and townsends guide to health vol   page     a quantity of the leaves should be procured fresh pounded in a mortar and mixed with oatmeal and applied as a poultice to the sores at first it occasions much pain and redness in the part but the pain after two or three repetitions abates and as to the redness that is a beneficial effect after the application a sloughing comes on and the discharge which was before thin and acrid is converted into good pus should the discharge be foetid powdered charcoal or fine mendip manganese reduced to an impalpable powder should be sprinkled over the sore previous to the poultice being applied thus the foetor will be corrected and the healing process forwarded at the same time  in the treatment of ulcers their disposition to heal let the means of promoting this purpose be what they may depends upon the matter secreted by them being first thickened by increasing the absorption in them and then lessened till all the matter is absorbed which is brought by the arteries instead of being deposited in the ulcers scrophulous ulcers are produced chiefly in the lymphaticglands by weak and relaxed vessels which have lost their tone and therefore have not vital

applied keeps up that proper irritability in the part which is essential to the formation of good matter the action of sorrel and lemonjuice applied to scrophulous ulcers probably arises in stimulating the languid inirritable absorbents by means of the oxygene contained in these substances just as acid gargles promote the absorption of the thinner parts of the saliva which is then easily dislodged these local applications will be rendered much more efficacious if the patient were at the same time to inspire hyperoxygenated air vide considerations on the medicinal use of factitious

chalybeates using at the same time a moderate degree of exercise the putrid appearance which scrophulous ulcers sometimes put on is owing to exhausted excitability followed by indirect debility which is discovered by the very offensive smell blackness and flaccidity in the part under these circumstances whilst vital energy is restored to the part by the oxalis or metallic oxyds particularly that

a remarkable case of scrophulous tomours in a young lady these had existed above ten years during which time for her father was an opulent merchant she had been under the care of the most eminent practitioners in this town she had taken mercury until the teeth began to drop from her head and bark and steel in large quantities and lastly the cicuta under the late celebrated john hunter until blindness had come on having been repeatedly at the seaside this last eminent practitioner informed her parents that the disease was so fixed in her habit that it would be in vain any longer to try medicine and this was also the opinion of several practitioners who had been consulted on the subject the tumors extended over the jawbones which could not be felt and made respiration difficult and concealment impossible after a months trial of the vitalair in conjunction with strengthening remedies and the application of stimulants to the inirritable glands a visible decrease took place and this plan being pursued for some months the diminution has been five inches in the neck by measurement and nearly a total disappearance of the diseased glands the effects of oxygenegas in this case were the most remarkable i ever witnessed the young lady enjoyed good spirits and experienced no inconvenience from the quantity of elastic fluids she had inhaled  case ii of thomas francis of bristol thomas francis aged five years about three years ago had several ulcers broke out about him for the cure of which he was put under the care of several surgeons in wales who ordered him to be dipped in the sea he took a variety of medicines and escharotics were applied to the sores but his health declining very fast his parents brough him up to bristol with a view of getting him admitted an inpatient to the infirmary in hopes of his there obtaining a speedy and permanent cure three weeks after his arrival in bristol he became an inpatient he continued only three days in and was then discharged as incurable under these circumstances i was urged to go and see him and upon examination found three very large scrophulous ulcers with flat irregular edges the discharge very thin acrid and foetid one was on the pectoral bone another over the vasties internus muscle and a third behind the ear he had a bad cough and disturbed nights the glands of the neck were hard and enlarged he had a very smooth skin thin upper lip with an inelastic feel and a blueness at the ends of his fingers from want of clothes and plenty of food together with the absorption of this purulent discharge from the ulcers he was reduced almost to skin and bones he was very subject to costiveness and always in great pain i applied powdered charcoal to all the sores over which i put the leaves of the oxalis acetosella simply bruised a dose of calomel was given him that night to evacuate the bowels when i called upon him next moring i found he had been in great pain occasioned by the oxalis he had only one stool during the night the dose of the calomel was increased from seven to twelve grains which before night procured four copious stools the ulcers were this day april    washed with diluted citricacid the oxalis was again applied the oxygene gas diluted with atmospherical air five quarts of the former to six of the latter was given him out of filken bags not having at that time a pneumatic apparatus a pint of wine was allowed him daily and exercise and clean clothing strictly enjoined forty drops vini opiat pharm chirurg were given him at bedtime     he has had a good night the discharge is increased in quantity is thicker and less offensive granulations begin to rise his pulse weak continued the oxalis repeated the air and opiate at bettime ordered him the most nourishing food and as much port wine as the could drink    the vessels on the surface of the sores appear to have acquired healthy action fresh granulations formed the discharge thicker his pulse more strong bowels costive appetite sharper repeated the oxalis and increased the quantity of oxygenegas to eight quarts ordered him a purging powder consisting of fifteen grains pull rhei and one scruple kali vitr    th the ulcers heal very fast granulations uniting every where the powder gave him two stools he had no pain from the application of the sorrel the glands behind the ears are of their former size his spirits are very good and his general health mends fast the oxalis was now omitted and nothing but lint dipped in a weak solution of the vitr coerul applied to the sores the purging powder ordered to be repeated every other night  ad tres vices  from this time till the   th of may the sores gradually healed and by the   th were cicatrized he was quite recovered in every respect by the is it of june when i discontinued my attendance and all medicines left off the vitalair was continued till the middle of july  this was the first case in which i had ever used the oxalis or administered the vital air and the success attending it far exceeded my expectations during the whole progress of cure i strictly enjoined exercise which increases respiration and quickens the circulation of the blood deriving thereby a greater quantity of oxygene from the surrounding atmosphere and distributing that pabulum of vital energy to every part of the animated frame pure air strengthens exercise whilst foul and vitiated air debilitates and exhausts the powers of life  case iii communicated to me by an eminent physician at bath july         miss a t aged  0 years a very beautiful and accomplished young lady had been afflicted with scrophula for three years when i first saw her she labored under phthisis pulmonalis the glands about the neck and behind the ears were much enlarged and felt hard she had two very deep and extensive ulcers one under her left ear and the other under her right arm she was subject to cold tremors every night about ten oclock with fever heat and flushing she expectorated every day half a pint of put streaked with blood her limbs were much emaciated she had lost her appetite and slept very ill the ulcers by my derection were dressed every day with the oxalis acetosella and the hydrocarbonated and oxygenated airs mixed administered in the proportion of five quarts of the former to six of the later daily under this plan of treatment with plenty of exercise and nourishing diet she recovered in three months and is now a healthy mother with a fine child a case somewhat similar to this is related by mr cavallo in his treatise upon factitious airs vide case viii page     and monsieur fourcroy speaks in the highest terms of the vitalair in scrophula vide fourcroys elements of chemistry tom   i have already referred the reader to dr beddoess treatise part iv published by johnson in st pauls churchyard  section iii of the pulmonary consumption when phthisispulmonalis arises from a scrophulous affection the seat of this disease is found clearly to exist in the cellular substance of the lungs where round firm bodies named tubercles are formed similar to the swelling of the lymphaticglands on the external surface they are of different sizes from the smallest granule to half an inch in diameter and often in clusters  they adhere pretty closely to the substance of the lungs and have no particular covering or capsule  in proportion to the smallness of their size is their firmness and when cut into in this state are of a white color with a consistence nearly approaching to cartilage in some part of them there is always a small pit or hollow where as they increase the formation of the matter begins and at length they pass into vomicae but the formation of matter is not always determined by their size in some it begins very early when in small quantity the consistence of the matter is thick and curdy when in greater quantity it is thinner and more resembling the matter of a common fore from this view of the disease which dissection affords tubercles and vomicae constitute the causes of this disorder with its several attendant symptoms and its difficulty of cure may be hence readily accounted for each of these tubercles is to be considered in the same light as that of an external lymphatic swelling which in order to its termination must be liable to all the subsequent consequences that either attend this or any rupture of the teguments in other situations while an additional obstacle to the process of healing is here presented from the constant motion of the lungs nisbit on scrophula   the accurate investigations of doctor stark de tuberculis pulmon have thrown more light upon the subject of tubercles than all the labors of preceding physicians he says that tubercles whilst small are always solid when large they are sometimes so they approach to the hardness of cartilage and when cut through appear smooth shining and uniform no vessels are to be seen in them even when after injecting the pulmonary artery and vein they are examined with a microscope they are always in the cellular substances never in the air vessels in which the extremities of the bronchial ramifications terminate they are at first extremely small numerous and in clusters but never in the least inflamed when they become vomicae it is always in the superior and posterior part of the lungs where they form strong adhesions to the pleura  those persons liable to tubercles the experiments of the very ingenious and learned doctor pascaljoseph ferro of vienna throw a considerable light upon some diseases to which he has made an extensive application of the principles of pneumatic medicine from his experiments he draws the following rational conclusions that the inspiration of oxygenegas dissipates the spasm of the vesicles of the lungs prevents the accession of those spasms diminishes and removes the disposition to inflammation in the lungs dissolves the extravasated lymph which obstructs the pulmonary vesicles produces good effects in the dropsy of the chest is a good remedy in the tuberculous consumption diminishes hectic fever relieves the oppression which subsists after inflammation of the chest cures speedily and effectually the periodical asthma and hooping cough augments the secretion of urine especially in affections of the breast produces no effects in rheumatism but is a sovereign remedy in scrophula are generally of a fair complexion soft skin and irritable fiber and disposed to suffer by lymphatic tumors some other circumstances of a local nature in addition to what has been said on the subject may add to the fatality of the disease in this climate and tend to bring it on where otherwise there was no predisposition in the patient to become so one cause which may assist greatly is that passion which manifests itself among our females but which daily grows out of fashion of wearing tight stays another great cause says the ingenious dr darwin to the shape of young ladies is from the pressure of stays or other tight bandages which at the same time cause other diseases by changing the form of situation of the internal parts some time ago i assisted in opening the body of a young woman in this city who died of phthisischlorotica  she had always i learnt been in the habit of wearning tight stays with a view of giving the body a fine shape i found the lungs full of tubercles mostly in a state of suppuration one remarkable appearance in this case was that the whole of the lungs was found on the right side of the mediastinum the heart with its appendages occupying the left the liver was enlarged the other viscera were sound the ingenious and learned author of medical extracts says the pressure of the abdomen by stays impedes the action of the stomach and bowels and the motion necessary for respiration and consequently the just circulation of the blood hence a train of dreadful disorders ensue the pliancy of the body and the natural grace of the female form is prevented by this rigid coat of mail the imprudent zeal of the mother for a fine shape performs another most unkindly office to the child she frequently becomes either incapacitated for marriage and what a serious reflection that is or dies in childbirth the madness in favor of stays seems however to be somewhat abated and it is hoped the world will in time become wise enough to know that the human shape does not solely depend upon whalebone and leather but prejudices once deeply rooted particularly in the female sex are only gradually obliterated  by which the circulation of the blood through the lungs is impeded the capacity of the thorax lessened and the space which in a state of health is required for the free action of the lungs is diminished a narrow chest a long neck and prominent shoulders though not occurring in all cases of scrophula may be considered as unfavourable marks of this disease mr townsend in his guide to health vol   observes that when medicines fail to effect a cure in phthisis pulmonalis a change of climate must be recommended and no climate in his opinion can be superior to that of valencia should the scrophulous or consumptive patient be inclined to make the trial he will have an easy route by paris lions montpellier and barcelona and for less than fifteen guineas he will find himself transported into a paradise in which nature exhibits an everlasting spring vide townsends travels through spain vol i and ii the fame ingenious author observes that he never met with this disease in spain owing as he thinks to the uniform state of the weather and heat of the climate but i shall have occasion hereafter to show that it is a disease incident to very warm and extreme cold climates and that contrary to the opinion of a celebrated professor is not influenced by the state of the weather  section iv tabes scrophulosa this species comprehends all cases in which diseased glands occasion atrophy it takes in therefore the tabes glandularis tabes mesenterica atrophia infantiles with the atrophia rachitica of sauvage and the tabes to which inebriates are subject from schirrhous glands whether of the liver spleen pancreas or mesentery and is attendant on the species just before enlarged upon phthisis pulmonalis in patients who have died of this modification of the disease in question i have sometimes found the receptaculum chyli and ductus thoracicus affected in like manner with the mesenteric glands vide also baillies morbid anatomy  d edit   section v ophthalmia tarsi the eyelids are very commonly another seat of this disease it is very difficult to make a patient laboring under the opthalmia tarsi believe so a very slight cold frequently brings on inflammation of the eyelids which ultimately terminates in a disorder of the eye and there is no form of the disease so tedious to remove or more painful in its attack or in which a relapse is more liable to occur than in this  after the inflammation of the eyelids commences a swelling of the sobaceous glands immediately follows which terminates in ulceration and this ulceration is generally of a troublesome nature a better description of the progress of this species of scrophula cannot well be given than in the words of doctor nisbit who observes that an acrid discharge constantly takes place from it which irritaing the eye itself renders it weak and unable to bear much impression either of light or heat frequently it is of a more viscid nature and glues the lids together in the nightime leaving a gorey appearance on the lid through the day  this form of the disease is not often acute it is of a more chronic species and gives a disagreeable appearance to the sight the eyelids continue always more or less inflamed thickened and raw and the ulcerations are with difficulty healed up or if they are break out afresh on any sudden cause of irritation on leaving one eye the inflammation is liable in such cases to attack the other and wherever one attack has taken place to a degree of violence the patient is exposed to its recurrence from the slightest cause i have never found any difficulty in effecting a cure in the worst cases and that even after all other remedies have failed by directing patients to take small doses of calomel at bedtime rubbing a little of the ung hydrargy nitrat between the lids the last thing at night and inhaling the vitalair in the daytime in doses suited to the age and constitution of the patient this new mode of treatment i shall illustrate by an example  a gentleman of my acquaintance had labored under an ulceration of both eyelids for nearly three years and on which account he had the advice of the most able oculists in this city a variety of applications at different times had been used and the materiamedica searched all over for various alteratives he had been at the seaside for four months and had taken the aquamarin internally during the whole of that time every other morning without intermission but had derived no advantage i recommended him strongly to inhale oxygenegas which he did regularly every day for three months in the proportion of eight quarts to twelve of atmospherical air as he could bear no sharp application to the eyelids simple spermaceti ointment melted in a spoon over a lighted candle was introduced by means of a camelshair pencil between the palpebrae every night under this plan of treatment in four months he was quite recovered and has since had no relapse change of air plenty of exercise with chalybeats and the ung hyd nit will seldom fail of removing this disease and their good effects will be augmented if the patient inhales the vitalair nourishing diet with generous portwine will give vigor to the system washing the eyelids with cold water of a morning is highly injurious  section vi of the hydarthus mr bryan crowder surgeon to bethlehem and bridewell hospitals has in a late publication on white swellings availed himself of an opinion delivered by the late mr pott which he has applied more extensively in his practice that of keeping up a purulent discharge from the neighborhood of the diseased joint which he has found highly efficacious by the application of the ceratum sabinae sabinae recent contusae cerae flavae singl lib j adips saillae lib iv adipe et cera liquefactis incoque sabinam et cola this is also a good dressing for scrophulous ulcers which are tardy in suppurating whether the conclusions which mr crowder draws that an issue in any part of the body may be successfully employed in all cases of scrophula and may probably be sufficiently powerful when it is applied in time to prevent an attack of this disease in constitutions predisposed to it future experience must determine i have observed that long continued drains generally accelerate the progress of hectic fever which in time seldom fails of having a fatal tendency and where a long continued perseverance in the use of the vitalair with change of air and corroborants fail of success i should have but little opinion of other remedies the hydarthus is usually reckoned as another species of scrophula which begins in the lymphatic glands about the kneejoint and is very painful and slow in its progress it commences with a slight tumefaction of the cellular membrane without any discolouration of the skin attended with great heat and frequent pain the skin appears clear and shining the joint becomes finally enlarged the surrounding parts feel elastic the limb gradually wastes abscesses form in the vicinity of the joint and a discharge takes place being as a late writer observes sometimes a viscid glairy fluid at other times more purulent and sometimes entirely sanious and foetid matter if the disease be not in this stage detected and its progress stopped it proceeds on and extends itself to the bone itself thus the cartilages take on symptoms of inflammation and are dissolved the bone itself is not exempted from undergoing the same change and the structure of the joint on dissection is found melted down more or less into one heterogeneous mass consisting of a white glairy fluid mixed with matter with pieces of carious bone of different sizes the patient in this last stage dies if amputation is not had recourse to and even the operation itself will not at all times prove salutary as the hectic attending these cases will frequently have too far reduced the strength of the patient  it will be necessary to distinguish properly between the scrophulous white swelling and that which arises from a rheumatic affection for reasons that must appear obvious to the practitioner from the unfavourable diagnosis which mr bell in his treatise on ulcers gives a practitioner might be intimidated from using his utmost endeavors in saving the limb for he observes page     that in the scrophulous white swelling it is not probable that art will ever be able to afford much assistance since the publication of mr bells treatise our hopes are revived from the benefits to be derived from inhaling the vital air see letters to dr beddoes from dr thornton to this effect  the rev mr townsend observes in his invaluable guide to health vol   that from what he has witnessed in the practice of his friend doctor thornton he is persuaded that in white swellings the inhalation of hyperoxygenated air will produce the greatest benefit for in this new mode of treatment with vital air energetic action in the part is supported by the system whereas in the old practice with external applications only it is kept up for a short time by partial stimuli on weak and diseased vessels  i would first recommend leeches to be applied and after they have fallen off blisters should succeed them at the same time i should advise bark and steel with the inhalation of oxygenegas with a fine open air gentle exercise and cheerful company and i make no doubt from the experience i have had in these cases that this disease is capable of being cured like other cases of scrophula  section vi of the bronchocele bronchocele though not usually ranked under the head of scrophula partakes in every respect of the nature of that disease it is generally found among persons living in mountainous situations tumidum guttur quis miratur in alpibus seems to have been a proverb in the time of juvenal as derbyshire somersetshire etc it comes on with a small swelling externally about the middle of the throat unattended with pain and gradually increases in size till it renders both respiration and deglutition laborious and difficult it has long been called the derbyshire neck from its frequent occurrence in that country but such appearances are now very common every where it is supposed by some to arise from an acidity in the stomach and absorbent medicines as burnt sponge the credulity of that physician is still further pitiable who from confidence in the peculiar efficacy of burnt sponge burnt leather and other trash of a similar nature expects to cure scrophula and a variety of tumors both encysted and solid occupying different portions of the body  i know of no character so truly despicable or that merits the indignation of society more than the wretch who despises the knowledge of rules of science in the practice of liberal art where the most invaluable of all human blessings health and its attendant comforts are at stake nothing surely more completely evinces the revival of the philosophy of democritus than this propensity of physicians to empyricism instead of observing coincidences of facts and affinities in nature they observe a very different conduct indeed like apt pupils in the democritic school they endeavor to demonstrate that nature is made up of parts completely heterogeneous with respect to each other and that a pleasing affinity is no where descernible in her phenomenon or the characteristic of her works    sal sodae magnes ust etc have been prescribed with that view upon the very respectable authority of mr townsend we are informed that in the vale of pewsey where it is very frequent he never fails of curing it in all who apply to him for advice by giving lozenges of burnt sponge well powdered and made up with the sir altheae vide guide to health vol ii page     finding however the usual remedies prescribed for this species of the disease so often fail i was resolved some time back to try the effects of the vitalair and a case to try the effects of the vitalair and a case shortly afterward coming under my care gave me a favorable opportunity of observing a very rapid progress under this plan of treatment  miss m p aged    years about three years ago perceived a small soft tumor growing about the middle of her throat which continued gradually increasing in size till the latter end of the year      it gave her no pain but sometimes affected her swallowing and looked very unsightly a variety of applications had been made to the part and under the care of several eminent men in this city she had taken the cicuta burnt sponge and latterly seawatar a solution of common salt in distilled water was also applied to the part by means of folds of linen cloth dipped in this mixture and renewed every eight hours but this rather did harm than good it is now pretty much the fashion for practitioners in surgery to apply seawater and solutions of common salt in various forms to indolent glandular swellings there is reason to believe that this practice is sometimes attended with success but i have myself always preferred a solution of the common crude sal ammoniac may not the efficacy of such applications be attributed rather to the saline particles being taken into the system by absorption and giving acrimony to the general mass of circulating fluids than to their acting merely as topical applications that they may be admitted into the system ab extra so as to produce very powerful effects will ptobably appear from the following case as related by doctor sherwen in his letter on scurvy a d      virgo quaedam anno aetatis suae quadragesimonono habitu

advantage this young lady was in the habit of drinking large draughts of cold water she began in february      to inhale eight quarts of oxygenegas with twelve of atmosphericalair daily till the latter end of july when the tumor was reduced to the size of a pullets egg she now left off the vital air finding no inconvenience from the tumor nor has it since that time grown any larger  it will be generally found that persons who have these monstrous enlargements of the thyroid glands drink much cold water and may not this chill these glands and bring on this disease it is found to consist chiefly of fat and the alkali which enters strongly into the vascular frame uniting with this fat forms soap the absorbents being roused into action by the vitalair which is known to produce leanness

lately been recommended in germany and so has the cicuta but neither have answered in the hands of medical practitioners in england who have strictly adhered to the rules laid down by the gentlemen who first proposed these remedies doctor gautieri vide tyrolensium carynthiorum styriorumque struma a josepho gautieri m d observata et descripta vindobonae apud boosey londini a very ingenious physician strongly recommends the different preparations of mercury and says he has cured ten cases out of fifteen with it i believe myself that in some cases it might be employed with advantage for the oxyd of mercury in passing through the human body parts with its oxygene and it is this oxygene alone which remains combined with the system that the effect produced by oxydated mercury is owing and therefore rouses the absrobents to action and if the vital air is administered at the same time its operation will be quickened  stimulants should be applied externally as liq c c vol electricity soap plaster etc  section vii hydrocephalus hydrocephalus is ranked by some as a species of scrophula the first symptoms are great restlessness violent pain in the head generally confined to one side especially above the eyes and in a direction between the temples sickness at stomach an itching of the nose loss of appetite a sallow and sometimes very white complexion the bowels are in general costive and it is with difficulty that stools can be procured these are generally of a dark greenish color with an oiliness or glassy bile rather than the slime which accompanies worms and they are for the most part extremely offensive febrile symptoms ensue which exacerbate toward evening great drowsiness languor and peevishness as the disease advances the pulse is usually slow and heavy in the commencement of the disease the pupils are very much contracted but as the disease advances a dilatation of the pupil takes place chiefly in that eye on which side the fluid is collected the child will at intervals scream out and have frightful dreams it will pick the bedclothes have subsultus tendinum and talk incoherently in this state i have known children to linger out a fortnight and sometimes three weeks occasioning the most poignant distress to those around doctor percival observes that hydrocephalus derives its origin sometimes from inflammation but most frequently from struma and laxity of fiber inducing glandular obstruction and feeble action of the lymphatic system all which dispose to an effusion of water in the brain the observations of bonnetus bonnetus sepulchretum anatomicum on this disease are the best to be found among the ancient writers but i much doubt whether or not he ever observed one half the morbid appearances in the heads of those persons he opened who died in consequence of the effusion of water which he relates with so much scrupulous exactness the theory of dropsy as established by doctor john brown and adopted by his pupils and those who practice on what is vulgarly called the brunonian system is most generally found to be successful excepting in a few instances where it has been injudiciously applied for it is now proved by rational practitioners that until the excitement is increased by such remedies as will be hereafter pointed out that no just expectations of cure can be entertained accumulations of water in the brain producing those symptoms which characterize hydrocephalus are the same with every other case of asthenia or idiopathic affection depending upon pure debility which though extended to the whole system is more prevalent in the exhalent and absorbent parts of it and more especially affecting the exhalents and absorbents of the brain  it is in the early stage of the disease that medicines can alone be of service when the affected side can be distinguished the trephine should be applied when the water is supposed from the mildness of the symptoms and their gradual progress to be effused between the dura and pia matter and when a very evident fluctuation can be felt chiefly at the bregma we ought to puncture without hesitation the dura matter as this can be done without danger it may give immediate relief and may have some chance of producing a cure should it be thought expedient to perform the operation the dura matter should be punctured cautiously with a lancet at the side of the bregma or as far as possible from the superior longitudinal sinus those who are attentive to the commencement and progress of the disease will with the greatest facility distinguish it from worm fever to which in its early stage it bears a strong analogy and for which it is frequently mistaken  hydrocephalus is distinguished from apoplexy by its being attended with fever and from nervous fever by the paroxysms being very irregular with perfect intermissions many times a day in nervous fevers the pain of the head generally affects the middle of the forehead in hydrocephalus it is generally on one side of the head doctor darwin whose opinion carries the greatest weight supposes that the great disposition in persons laboring under the disease to lie down immediately after having raised their heads from off the pillow is owing to the pressure of the water on the large trunks of the blood vessels entering the cavity being more intolerable than on the smaller ones for if the large trunks are compressed it must inconvenience the branches also but if some of the small branches are compressed only the trunks are not so immediately incommoded i think it is highly probable that where one eye is affected the disease exists in the ventricle of that side some authors assert that this disease seldom appears after the thirteenth year whereas it daily occurs in all ages from two years to thirty vide monros three treatises on the brain the eye and the ear the doctor mentions the case of a woman who had hydrocephalus in her twentysixth year  though it attacks chiefly children  a woman in the parish of st giless bloomsbury was seized with hydrocephalus in her twentysixth year she was treated by the medical attendants in the usual way by having recourse to bleeding purging and other evacuations she died on the twelfth day upon opening the head i found the vessels of the brain very turgid though she had lost thirty ounces of blood the anterior ventricles were filled with a diaphanous fluid the foramen in the septum lucidum was so distended as to admit the top of my little finger the tunica arachnoidea was opake and thickened in all there were about four ounces and a half of water in the ventricles in the pericardium there was found more fluid than is usual in a healthy state  it is a melancholy fact that hundreds of children die annually of this disease who might perhaps under the care of skilful persons have recovered  the remedies which have been most commonly resorted to for the cure of this complaint are mercury blisters applied on the head calx zinci squills opium and digitalis and of late the fol doron german now as all these remedies generally fail it is proper to propose some others  so soon as this disease assumes the character of hydrocephalus the head should be immediately shaved and from eight to a dozen leeches applied after they fall off blisters in the direction of the sutures ought to be laid on and electrical sparks should be passed through the head in all directions the bowels are best emptied with large doses of hydrarg muriat mitis a generous diet should be enjoined to invigorate the system and the alimentary canal in particular  the oxygenegas which has already been shown to be so powerful in rousing into action that set of vessels which in this disease is inert and paralytic should be administered daily diluted with atmospherical air suited to the age and constitution of the patient in short whatever will rouse the absorbent system to a vigorous action should be employed since we find by our researches into the animal economy that the absorbents do not act by capillary attraction but with vital energy so their action may be either excessive or diminished  opium opium although much used in medicine is scarcely ever given in sufficient doses to answer the wishedfor design its qualities do not seem known to those physicians who in books and lectures assume to themselves the whole province of guiding the practice of physic instead of making it the highest stimulant in nature they call it a sedative they tell us it alleviates pain but it does no such thing it removes the cause whenever that depends upon debility it is a sovereign remedy but much misapplied both in our hospitals and in private practice in large doses is found to be very beneficial as a powerful stimulant sternutatories have been employed with advantage for this purpose one grain hydrargy vitriol to ten grains of liquorice powder might be used as a snuff  it will be unnecessary to relate all the cases in which the method of cure i have recommended has proved successful the following are selected from several more which were exceeding alarming in their attack  case i case of mary watkins mary watkins aged fourteen years was seized march  th      with a violent pain across her forehead as she was sat at work attended with great sickness at stomach and sudden languor she had felt herself slightly indisposed a few days before and upon a supposition that it arose from worms an electuary of sulphur and treacle had been given her she had on the preceding night been exposed to great cold  on the  th she complained of vertigo acute pain in her head particularly above the eyebrows  during the night she talked incoherently and called frequently for something to drink on the  th the pupil of her left eye was much dilated and she vomited up a quantity of slime the gentleman who attended her bled her largely in the left arm and gave her a dose of calomel and rhubard  at night one dram ung hyd f was directed to be rubbed in between the thighs  she was denied animal food and allowed nothing but barleywater to drink  on the  th her pulse was very feeble she had been comatose during the night and had subsultus tendinum she picked the bedcloaths and frequently tried to get out of bed  during the whole of the night she constantly kept her hand to her head blisters were applied between the shoulders and to the calves of the legs  one the  th i saw her for the first time when i entered the room she had a wild stare with her and muttered something in a low voice  at times she was delirious i emptied the bowels with ten grains of calomel ppt and after shaving the head applied twelve leeches to the affected side after which narrow strips of emp vesic were applied in the direction of the sutures in the evening i passed several electrical shocks in various directions through the head and gave her three drams of ether vitr c with one hundred drops tinct opii in a glass of rum and water she had a very good night  in the morning her pulse was sixtyfour  she knew and conversed with her friends and appeared much relieved  march  0th electricity was repeated  the blisters ordered to be kept open with the cerat canth directed the pull sternut as before mentioned to be snuffed up three different times during the day  the calomel was repeated at six oclock in the evening she was allowed any thing to eat or drink she wished for rum and water was given her for common drink at bedtime ten grains of the amm praep with eighty drops of laudanum was given her in a saline draught    th she is surprisingly better today is got out of bed and sits up in an arm chair  has little or no pain in her head  complains of numbness in her legs  directed them to be put into the warm bath  at night gave two grains of opium in a pill with the volatile alkali in rum and water    th she mends very fast has had a good night and all the other symptoms are alleviated gave her twelve quarts of oxygenegas and fifteen of atmospherical air which she inhaled with ease  the electricity omitted repeated her opium and volatile at night from this time she gradually regained her strength the symptoms subsided and by the first of april she was quite recovered she continued the vitalair till the   th of march  case ii case of mary durand for the particulars of this case i am obliged to doctor thornton mary durand aged nine years living at no    in jermynstreet labored under hydrocephalus among other symptoms she had an heavy oppression in the head which obliged her frequently to recline it on a pillow complete blindness of the right eye and fits which would frequently seize her so suddenly that she would fall down from her chair and remain convulsed often for near half an hour but without foaming of the mouth as in epilepsy doctor t being applied to gave her the vital air with steel and bark internally but the only alteration produced was an amendment of health as her pulse was remarkably slow not more than    beats in a minute on the tenth day he gave her thirty quarts of oxygne gas moderately diluted the effect of which was an immediate return of vision and she has remained free from headache and fits with distinct vision now above a year  the usual method of treating dropsies by repeated bleeding vomiting purging clistering evacuation by urine and the skin in one word opening and relaxing all the excretories and weakening the activity of the absorbents every where which is the undeniable practice for the cure of a disease the cause of which is that very state of vessels which these remedies produce is so absurd and contradictory that i do not wonder that dropsy in all its forms and particularly in the present hydrocephalus should baffle the art of practitioners the cause of dropsy so far as its respects the collection of water is easily explicable upon the doctrine of doctor brown elementinae medicinae chap     editio nova a thomas beddoes m d but altogether inexplicable upon any other for the universal debility and exhausted excitability followed by laxity and atony are chiefly predominant in the extreme red arteries and the exhalents immediately continued from these as well as in the commencements of the absorbent veins and it is often urgent in a particular set of these vessels only  repeated successful trials of the mode of cure i have recommended sufficiently vouch its propriety a case given up by the ordinary vide joness inquiry into the state of medicine practitioners was readily and radically cured by my good friend dr wainman and little before the time that i am writing this another pupil of dr brown the ingenious mr hogan performed a cure of universal dropsy upon an old sailor near  0 years of age in a vessel that was cruising in the north seas this patient labored under universal anasarca and ascitic dropsy his legs were so oedematous as to be swelled to an enormous bulk  no evacuation it is a fact that the new system of medicine introduced by the late doctor john brown has produced a more remarkable revolution both in the theoretical and practical departments of this branch of science than is to be found throughout the whole history of medicine under all the former doctrines of this art and under almost every modification of disease we find an universal sameness in the method of cure bleeding purging vomiting and every other mode of evacuation were indiscriminately applied in almost every disease and even in those cases in which stimulants were employed or an invigorating plan of cure pursued they were frequently alternated with evacuants as if certain diseases could not be eradicated except by the opposite means of inducing debility and vigor at the same time in the body  the practice founded on the new theory in one respect resembles the old as the same method of cure is employed in the far greater number of diseases the old theorists universally applied evacuants and endeavored to debilitate the system by every means the application of stimulants is nearly as universal on the principles of the new theory  herdmans essay on the causes and phenomenon of life of any kind was administered to this patient the cure was trusted to spirituous regimen and in less than three weeks time the patient was conducted from the jaws of death to the most entire and perfect health having strongly recommended the spirituous regimen in the cure of hydrocephalus it might not be improper to observe here that some persons have affected to reject the brunonian system upon the very grave and solemn ground of its being favorable to intemperance to those however who will take the trouble of making themselves acquainted with its principles it will be only necessary to state that such persons do not understand the subject i make no doubt but i shall incur the displeasure of those who without ingenuity to invent or candor enough to acknowledge the merits due to others hastily condemn new doctrines before they have bestowed the necessary pains which are required to understand them i every day see with regret the power of prejudice in favor of old erroneous systems and how great the resistance is even to the most certain and luminous experiments prejudice has certainly a great share in this repugnance but above all selflove dreads to adopt new truths because they carry with them conviction and a tacit avowal of ignorance hence arises the difficulty of bringing those who are advanced in years and men of learning who have already acquired reputation to admit of new discoveries it appears to me says lord bolingbroke that the author of nature has thought fit to mingle from time to time among the societies of men a few and but a few of those on whom he is graciously pleased to bestow a larger portion of the aetherial spirit than is given in the ordinary course of his providence to the sons of men look about you from the palace to the cottage you will find that the bulk of mankind is made to breathe the air of this atmosphere to roam about this globe and to consume like the courtiers of alcinous the fruits of the earth  nos numerus sumus et fruges consumere nati when they have trod this insipid round a certain number of years and begot others to do the same after them they have lived and if they have performed in some tolerable degree the ordinary moral duties of life they have done all they were born to  look about you again nay look perhaps in your own breast and you will find that there are superior spirits men who show even from their early youth though it be not always perceived by others perhaps not always felt by themselves that they were called into this world for something more and better these are they who engross almost the whole reason of their species who are born to instruct who are designed to be the tutors and guardians of human kind when they prove such they exhibit to us examples worthy of the highest praise and they deserve to have their names recorded instead of a crowd of warriors who have laid the world waste by their ravages whose worth is estimated by the quantity of innocent blood they have spilt and with whose sanguinary feats the page of history is crowned and disgraced  section viii rachitis the rachitis or rickets to which children are so peculiarly subject is another modification of scrophula monsieur portal a very ingenious french surgeon who has lately published a treatise on rachitis is of opinion that the rickets is very rarely an original disease but is almost always the result of some internal and antecedent affection numerous observations he thinks prove that there are six different species of this malady to wit the venereal the scrophulous the scorbutic that which accompanies or which succeeds abdominal obstructions and lastly that which may be denominated rheumatic or gouty vide observations sur la nature et sur le traitment de rachitisme par monsieur portal   this disease so destructive to the infant race of this country called by the french the english disorder never appeared in britain till manufactures began to flourish and people attracted by the sordid love of gain left the country to follow sedentary plments in great towns glisson defines rachitis to be a disease jui generis glisson de rachitide  i never saw the rickets myself but in those children in whom vestiges of a scrophulous affection could be readily traced  it generally shows itself first by an enlargement of the head great weakness in the spine a prominence of the forehead and sudden emaciation of the whole body the muscles feel flaccid the ribs lose their convexity and become flattened on the sides while the sternum is pushed outward the abdomen is tumified and feels hard and the child is generally costive the child loses its usual cheerfulness and becomes dull and peevish in some you observe great acuteness and mature sensibility while in others stupidity and fatuity appear the dentition is very slow and i have remarked that those teeth which come out have a very smooth feel and soon lose color little or no fever attends this stage of the disease but as it advances the pulse is more frequent and the appetite very keen the appearances on dissection show a melancholy state of the disease vide bailies morbid anatomy morgagni de causis et sedibus morbum bonetus sepulchretum anatom cum multis aliis in general all the abdominal viscera are preternaturally enlarged the lungs filled with tubercles and adhering to the pleura the mesentericglands indurated the brain flaccid and all its cavities filled with an effusion of a serous fluid the bowels boaded with slime and mucus the bones are so soft as to be easily cut through and the muscular parts very tender and loose for a proximate cause doctor cullen clinical lectures assigned a deficiency of oseous matter in the fluids depending upon a general laxity and debility of the moving fibers of the organs that perform the functions of digestion and assimilation  monsieur bonhomme annals de chemie a celebrated french chemist supposes the nature of the rachitic disorder arises on the one hand from the developement of an acid approximating in its properties to the vegetable acids particularly the oxalic and on the other from the defect of phosphoricacid of which the combination with the animal calcareous earth forms the natural basis of the bones and gives them their solidity  from whence it follows that the indication resulting from this proposition if once adopted would be that the treatment of rachitis must depend on two principal points namely to prevent the developement of the oxalicacid and to reestablish the combination of the phosphoricacid with the basis of the bones to which they owe their solidity  the author proves by experiments and observations in the first place that alkaline lotions to the parts affected with rachitis contribute to their cure see also nicholsons journal of chemistry no    next that the calcareous phosphate taken internally is really transmitted by the lymphatic passages and contributes to ossification and lastly that the internal use of calcareous phosphate whether alone or combined with the phosphate of soda powerfully contributes to restore the natural proportions in the substance of the bones and accelerate the cure of rachitis  the effect of the action of acids upon bones was long before known that is to say that when deprived of calcareous phosphate and reduced to the gelatinous parenchyma which forms one of their elements they lose their consistence and become flexible hence it was already conjectured by various physicians that the rachitis was the effect of a peculiar acid  every one who is attentive to the diseases of children must have observed a disposition to acescence in the primae viae the odor which characterizes acescence is often manifest in their breath and even their perspiration the bile which is the natural cathartic of the body corrects this disposition but we generally find a deficiency of this secretion in rachitic infants it does not color their excrements and the acids accordingly are developed in a very decided manner they disturb the circulation and attack and soften the bones as it is by defect of animalization that these acids develope themselves it follows that their character is analogous to the fermentescible vegetable acids and more or less to the oxalic acid and that on the contrary the animal acid of phosphoric acid ceases to be formed and to unite with the animal calcareous earth whence they are deprived of the principle of their solidity  in order to establish the doctrine of monsieur bonhomme upon precise experiments it is requisite to analyze rachitic bones comparatively with those of healthy individuals of the same age and as it is known that the urine of rachitic subjects deposits a great quantity of a substance of sparing solubility and earthy appearance it would be advantageous to make a complete analysis of this urine and its sediment it is known that when the urine contains disengaged phosphoricacid as happens to aged individuals and in some peculiar circumstances of the system if lime water be poured in there is a speedy deposition of calcareous phosphate it is also known that when a solution of the nitrate of mercury is poured on the fresh urine of adults a rosecoloured precipitate is formed which is a phosphate of mercury produced by the decomposition of the phosphates contained in the urine these two proofs are therefore extremely proper to ascertain the prescence of phosphoricacid whether free or combined in a fluid which in its natural state contains a remarkable proportion besides this principle the urine deposits more or less of sediment either gelatinous or an earthy appearance and lastly by evaporation a saponaceous and saline extract in greater or less abundance is obtained by evaporation   doctor darwin is of opinion that if the theory of monsieur bonhomme were just the soft parts of such bones should show evident marks of such acidity after death which he believes has not been observed nor is it adds he darwins zoonomia analagous to other animal facts that nutritious fluids secreted by the finest vessels of the body should be so little anamalized as to retain acetous or vegetable acidity  bad nursing and an overproportion of food for the age of the child i have been often surprised to see the quantity of food some ignorant and obstinate nurses will give infants far more at each meal than the stomach can possibly contain  this they do with a view of quieting the child and inducing it to go to sleep whereby they may be exonerated from the trouble of nursing it the ignorance of parents is no less conspicuous in the quantity of wine fruit etc they indulge children in and how easy is it to trace the diseases of children to the source from whence they originate inattention to cleanliness cold either without moisture or with it want of exercise bad air and innutritious food are the chief causes which bring it into action i am inclined to think that this disorder first takes its rise from the mouths of the lacteals being obstructed by mucus from a deficiency of bile and the disengagement of an elastic gas in the intestines during the process of fermentation the digestion then becomes impaired and a laxity and debility pervade the whole system hoffman supposes it to depend on a deficiency of nutrimental juices depraved digestion ill conditioned chyle and obstructed lacteals and observes quam maxim autem hoc loco accusari etiam debet bilis defectus vel inertia a praeternaturali hepatis constitutione inducta ob quam non modo digestio valde laeditur sed oscula

has been more accurately explored no doubt from his recommending cathartics supposed it to originate in a foul state of the stomach and bowels and the high authority of the learned author of the guide to health confirms this opinion for he says that after thirty years experience in a neighborhood in which rickets abound i do not recollect a single instance in which this tamarind truct j fol sennae iv rhei incis iij coque q s aquae colaturae vj dissolv mannae et sir rosae sol a ij fiat mixtura c c c ij plus minus pro aetate guide to health vol ii page     cathartic failed with the assistance of tonics to effect a cure  most scrophulous and rachitic patients are very pale and have a blueness about the ends of their fingers and under their eyes which indicate a deficiency of oxygene in the blood and the inirritability of the muscles evinces this also for upon restoring that principle either by the organs of digestion or through the medium of the lungs with proper cathartics exercise and wholesome air they soon recover without much medicine i have never seen any good derived from the whole class of tonics with which our materia medica furnishes us and which physicians have extolled as specifics  a favorable subterfuge for medical ignorance the ensveneris soda and cicuta are mere trash the acidity so predominant in young rachitic subjects should be corrected by giving rhubarb magnesia and vitriolated kali cold bathing and exercise  friction all over the body with a brush  the bowels kept clear from sordes by large doses of calomel ppt and a plentiful supply of vitalair by the organs of respiration will in all cases where good can be done effect a cure  of the benefits arising from the vitalair i have seen several instances but the following case the first in which i recommended it deserves notice  miss g a aged two years very thin and tall of her age about nine months ago complained of a pain in the back about the third lumbar vertebra she was so weak in that part as always to require support behind a most singular enlargement took place which was particularly conspicuous in the extremities contiguous to the articulations and in the bones of the cranium her countenance became pale  she had a very craving appetite and showed a great disposition to eat chalk her belly became tumid and hard and her breathing laborious which last symptom arose from a very small thorax much flattened in before and at its sides  emetics cathartics and absorbents were the chief medicines prescribed as occasion required and in the mean time an infusion of the cinchonae with tinct ferri was given three times a day notwithstanding she grew daily worse and was so emaciated as scarcely to be recognized by her friends  under these circumstances i recommended the vitalair which she inhaled daily four quarts to six of common air at night she took pills composed of ferr vitr and ext cinchonae and five grains of calomel at bedtime once a week this plan being pursued four months in conjunction with exercise nutritious diet and a fine open air she quite recovered and is now a healthy girl  this case i related some time back a one of our medical societies in this city where the cure was attributed by the antipneumatics if i may be allowed the expression to the steel medicine diet etc but as this medicine when given per se is ineffectual from the small quantity of oxygene it deposits in the constitution it certainly must be acknowledged that it was the supply by the organs of respiration that restored the young lady to health  there appears a propensity in human nature to resist conviction and that propensity is exceedingly conspicuous in the present instance in which prejudice opposes palpable evidence and although like naaman the assyrian i cannot tell why the waters of jordan should be better than abana and pharpar rivers of damascus yet since experience has proved them so no reasoning can change my opinion of the good effects the airs have on this and a variety of other diseases for slight efforts lead not to success or fame by care and toil the wise pursue their aim menand  an impaired digestion i before mentioned as one of the primary symptoms of rachitis this as the late ingenious physiologist mr hunter proved by experiments on various animals arises from the diminution of animal heat which quickens the process of digestion now the generation of animal heat according to doctors goodwin and crawford and the rev mr townsends is from the decomposition of oxygenegas in the lungs during respiration a theory different from this has been offered by mr rigby who observes that the sense of superior heat which is obviously felt in the region of the stomach is a proof that if that be not the immediate source of all animal heat that at least a considerable portion is generated there and confirms the foregoing opinion that heat is generated during the decomposition of our food in the stomach rigby on animal heat  thus as i suppose a part of the oxygene unites with the iron contained in the blood and converts it into an oxyd another and a greater proportion unites with the carbon brought by the venous blood to the lungs and forms carbonicacid gas while another portion of the oxygene unites with the hydrogene brought in the same manner and forms water  a portion of this oxygene which unites with the iron and hydrogene becomes fixed on these substances and gives out the heat which supported it in a gaseous state while the remainder forming carbonicacid gas which has a less capacity for heat than oxygenegas gives out a part of its caloric thus respiration is the cause of a continual extrication of heat in the lungs which being conveyed by the blood to all parts of the body is a constant source of heat to the animal we may therefore consider respiration as an operation in which oxygenegas is continually passing from the gaseous to the concrete state it will therefore give out at every instant the heat which it held in combination  these important facts enable us to explain the reason why the inhalation of a larger proportion of oxygenegas than what is received from the atmosphere during the process of respiration by raising the temperature of heat in the body thereby accelerating digestion or assisting it when impaired is of so much service in rachitis as there is a scarcity of oxygene in many of the diseases to which children are incident all such as are rachitic badly nursed potbellied or disposed to hydrocephalus internus or water on the brain should pass the greater part of the middle of the day in fine weather in the nurses arms or at play according to their age and other circumstances in the neighborhood of shrubberies or more extensive plantations  archers miscellaneous observations on the effects of oxygene page     and is not the costiveness attendant on the rickets to be attributed to a deficiency of oxygene as well as the paleness and sallow complexion doctor thornton observes that when he made his dyspeptic patients breathe superoxygenated air they not only acquired appetite and spirits but became more regular in their bowels and rosy health appeared in their cheeks i never inhale the vitalair myself but it gives me a voracious appetite and raises my spirits much above the usual standard we know also from experience that oxygene increases the secretions in general and therefore may increase the quantity of bile which is proved to be the natural cathartic of the body and at the same time gives tone and vigor to the secreting vessels it is highly probable therefore that it may improve the quality of the secreted fluid the effects also before stated well oxygenated air has in raising the spirits is another desirable object attained in this new mode of treatment and the case of mr atwood communicated to doctor beddoes and by him presented to the public in the second edition of his inestimable work entitled further considerations on the medicinal use and on the production of factitious airs and that of mr russel are convincing proofs of his assertion  doctor priestley whose loss to this country cannot be too deeply deplored by all friends to the investigation of philosophical truths speaking somewhere of factitious airs says i cannot help flattering myself that in time very great and medicinal use will be made of the application of these different kinds of airs to the animal system let ingenious physicians attend to this subject and lay hold of the new handle which is now presented them before it is seized on by rash empirics who by an indiscriminate and injudicious application often ruin the credit of things and processes which might otherwise make an useful addition to the materia and ars medica  incurvations of the spine arising from a scrophulous affection have already been treated of with so much judgment by the late mr pott of st bartholomews hospital that it will be unnecessary to say much on the subject here the mode he suggested was by applying a caustic on each side of the projection and afterward establishing a considerable drain by converting them into large issues a plan of treatment which every days experience proves the propriety of  this was done with a view of exciting a new action and by that means superseding diseased action potts works by earl vol iii   a protuberance of the spine proceeding from scrophula might be treated by putting an issue on each side of the prominent bone which i suppose acts by its stimulus which excites into action more of the sensorial powers of irritation and sensation and thus gives greater activity to the vascular system in the vicinity darwins zoonomia vol ii doctor darwin has found pills composed of ext cinchonae  sod phosp and opium combined of service the ancients recommended compression swinging slings to suspend the children by a bandage round the head and by the shoulders but they all prove ineffectual of late years several kinds of machinery have been introduced into practice with a view of giving support to the spine by taking off the pressure of the head and shoulders monsieur vacher an ingenious frenchman invented some years ago a machine of which he has given an account in the memoires de lacademie royale de chirurgie tom iv accompanied with a plate the principle upon which this machine acts is the keeping of the head in an erect posture and the spine in as straight a line as it naturally does or as it possibly can admit of in a diseased state and in supporting the superincumbent weight of the head shoulders and upper extremities from pressing downwards on the distorted spine and increasing the curvature of it since that another machine or rather an improvement on monsieur vachers has been invented by mr jones an ingenious staymaker of this city and i believe it has been of service in some cases mr wilkinson the ingenious lecturer on experimental philosophy at st bartholomews hospital has lately recommended to our notice a spinal stay which possesses many advantages over all the rest by taking off in a very adequate degree all weight by giving greater support to the shoulders neck and head he has also written some excellent observations on distortions of the spine well worthy the perusal of those who wish to attain further information on the subject men who have studied anatomy are the best qualified to judge of the necessary powers to be applied and the mode of their application  of the spina bifida i shall refrain from offering any observations at present it is a true scrophulous affection and is incurable by any means yet recommended a quack in this town undertook for a trifling sum of money last winter to cure a child about six months old who had a tumor of this kind situated on the third dorsal vertebra this he undertook to effect by evacuating the contents with a lancet when he came next day he found the child dead and to reconcile its disappointed parents to their loss and his ignorance pretended that it was occasioned by the compression owing to the childs laying on its back during the night i examined the diseased parts after death and have a drawing of them by me  having pointed out in as concise a manner as possible those seats of the disease in the system where we are to look for the greatest danger i shall proceed to consider the general history of the disorder and examine the different opinions of the various writers on scrophula  our schools of physic lay great stress on parthology or certain appearances in the patient by which they suppose the nature the stage and result of the disease may be pointed out those criterions are to be sought after in the eyes the nose the skin the tongue the pulse a knowledge of the pulse is highly necessary to a good physician though it is the source of a number of errors in practice from the false inferences and hasty conclusions which medical men draw upon the slightest deviation or irregularity in this thermometer of the human body to the attainment of this object many and considerable obstacles oppose themselves for the pulse not only varies in quickness at different periods of life but different temperatures and even statures have corresponding varieties of pulse thus the pulse in women is ordinarily found to be about one seventh quicker than in men the proportion is still greater in women during courtship in men of a short stature it is quicker than in those who are tall and in children than in adults the pulse is said to become slower from fortyfive to fifty or sixty years of age but afterward to become quicker a kind of hectic being supposed to be the usual concomitant of age which makes the pulse infantine pulse thus the pulse which at the moment of birth beats     strokes in a minute decreases in velocity to the period of manhood when its medium may be reckoned at    is stationary at  0 or  0 according to the degree of health or firmness of constitution of the subject and then increases again as the body becomes enfeebled by age  the pulse varies also at different times of the day in the morning before breakfast it is slowest it becomes quicker after every meal and that in proportion to the quantity and quality of the food taken into the stomach and becomes slower again at night during sleep if the stomach has not been too much loaded or defrauded of its necessary proportion of food the different passions operate strongly on the pulse as fear anger joy love sorrow etc those who would wish to be acquainted with this important branch of physiology must consult the writings of falconer adair sir john floyer dr bryan robinson dr heberden rumball and other writers of merit  and the gestures that those particular deviations from the patients natural appearance during health do appear frequently is most true but the major part of them are fallacious and inconclusive because they are often produced by opposite cause thus we are told by writers that the attacks of scrophula are peculiar to the sanguine and those constitutions which posses fine skins a soft muscular flesh with a rosy complexion a thickness of the upper lip and blue eyes as also that those persons who have red or light colored hair are particularly subject to this disease  an astronomer may as well expect to draw a just conclusion of the real motions of jupiter or any other primary planet from their apparent contorted and looped evolutions or a philosopher discover a law of nature in physics or morals by an appeal to the categories of aristotle or a critic hope for fame in all the fine arts when he breathes nothing but the rules of aristotle quintillian and longinus as a physician can hope to discover the nature and causes of diseases when he rears his inductions on false evidence and anomalous signs  the first attacks of scrophula as described by some authors are no less extravagant than absurd the following quotation from a recent publication will serve for an example  the infinite variety of complaints an impure or infected state of the blood induces almost exceeds belief and hence the new and deceptive forms a scrophulous taint puts on which often deceives the most eminent of the faculty and baffles the best intention toward a cure an impure or scrophulous taint will invade the noblest organs of the human frame before the patient can be aware of his danger in the first stage of its invincible attack a weary pain seizes the joints and muscles attended with a wasting of the legs and loins in the second stage the gums swell grow painful hot and irritable and bleed upon the slightest pressure the roots of the teeth become loose and bare and the breath nauseous in the third stage the gums grow putrid and the teeth black and rotten the sublingular veins become varicose and the breath cadaverous foetid blood distills from the lips gums mouth nose and lungs stomach liver spleen pancreas intestines womb kidneys etc scabs and ulcers break out over all parts of the body and the joints bones and vifcera become morbid in the fourth stage putrid eruptive and spotted fevers ensue which end in atrophy

afflicted might well exclaim with the royal psalmist for my loins are filled with a sore disease and there is no whole part in my body psalm xxxviii ver   one would have supposed that this learned author had been describing the seascurvy instead of scrophula and i doubt whether the herculean remedy which he prescribes for this melancholy train of human maladies notwithstanding the invention of

found effectual medical mirror page   0  at what period scrophula first made its appearance in this country i cannot precisely fix the history of all diseases is involved in a deal of obscurity but particularly this a late writer is of opinion that the morbus coxendicis of hippocrates is the scrophulous hip of the present day and that those particular diseases mentioned by ancient authors as having their origin in what they term cold pituitous humor falling on a joint and which sometimes occasioned luxation as also the complaints denominated spina ventosa meliceria hydarthus and fungus articuli are in their symptoms and effects very analogous to the different species of the disease which is generally denominated white swelling  scrophula doctor cullen says that scrophula generally shows itself first at a particular season of the year and at some time between the winter and summer solstice but commonly long before the latter period it is to be observed further that course of the disease is usually connected with the course of the seasons whilst the tumors and ulcerations peculiar to this disease appear first in the spring the ulcers are frequently healed up in the course of the succeeding summer and do not break out again till the ensuing spring to follow again with the season the same course as before cullens first lines vol iv does not show itself at any particular age though it seldom appears before the second year or after the twentieth nor have i observed it to be aggravated by any particular season of the year it is to be found in very hot and very cold climates i have myself seen it among the natives of balambuang an island inhabited by malays governed by a dutch commandant and lying almost on the line in the streights of borneo  the chinese are particularly subject to this disease it is highly probable that the innutritious food upon which the lower classes of chinese subsist is one of the predisponent causes which brings it into action while i was in china between the months of february and june      i was shocked at the scanty subsistence of these abject mortals their food consists chiefly or rice and water our horses are better fed in england and our beggars are regaled like princes to what mendicants are in china  nor have they been able with all their subtelty and pretensions to physic to discover as yet any remedy for it  persons afflicted with scrophulous ulcers walk about the streets of canton without any application to them and with much seeming indifference they are equally superstitious and show the same marks of fatuity with the people of this country who trust their cures to empirics and astrologers with which that country is disgracefully overrun like our own it is but doing justice however to add that it is only the lower class of chinese and not those who have received a liberal education that entrust their lives to the precarious issue of medicines prepared and vended by such locusts and it is right to add to the honor of the chinese government that notwithstanding it is the most despotic and arbitrary on the face of the earth it reaps no emolument like others which boast more of liberty by granting these wretches license and patents to slaughter mankind let me here anxiously caution the unwary of being misled by those who have obtained the kings letters patent it is much to be lamented that in this enlightened age the attention of the public should still continue to be turned toward specifics when it is well known that the same disease not unfrequently proceeds from a variety of causes and therefore properly speaking no specific remedy can exist what reason can we assign then for the astonishing and still increasing demand for quack medicines and quack book whence is it that quack medicines and quack books are to be found not merely among the lower classes of society but in respectable families and almost in every house is it that they have a higher opinion of such medicines and of such books than of the judgment the skill the extensive experience of men devoted to the science of men who have been regularly taught and who are in the daily habit of distinguishing diseases

writer observes motives of personal regard prevent me from discussing the abilities of the different fellows the great leviathan of the college  before his death is reported to have declared that

paralytic from the action of some poisonous material probably an acid generated during the process of digestion slime by little and little adheres to the intestines and plugs up the mouths of the lacteals and renders them torpid and schirrous the glands then become large externally and inirritable from being over stimulated the digestive faculties of the stomach grow languid the mouths of the lacteals will often inflame and turn to ulcers  a general relaxation and atony pervade the whole system  small oval or spherical tumors form under the skin which at first appear like a small knot smooth and moveable with some elasticity and they gradually increase in number and size till they form one hard large fixed tumor chiefly in the neck and behind the ears  they do not give much pain or is the color of the skin changed  the joints of the elbows and ancles as well as of the fingers and toes become stiff and painful and it very frequently happens that an anchylosis of some principal joint remains though the other symptoms be abated in some a very bad cough harasses the patient which i think proceeds from a morbid state of the liver the sour eructations arise from a prevailing acidity in the stomach and the tumid abdomen from the disengagement of elasticgas in the intestinal canal the first effect of viscid mucus in the alimentary canal is sedative as appears by the slow and feeble pulse languor and depression of spirits coldness of the extremities and deficiency of perspiration which it constantly produces and which are attendant symptoms in the latter stage of the disease hence if proper advice is not had an atrophy ensues and the unhappy patient will sink under his load of grief and pain a victim to the want of application of the principles of philosophical analysis to the subject of the materia medica  the disease sometimes creeps on flowly for a number of years without producing much derangement in the health of the patient and instances are not wanting where it has been spontaneously cured the ulcers healing up and no new tumors appearing and as doctor cullen has observed that thus at length the disease ceases entirely leaving only some indelible eschars pale and smooth but in some parts shrivelled or where it had occupied the joints leaving the motions of these impared or entirely destroyed  such is the history and progress of this disease which adds more to the bills of mortality than almost any other and disfigures the most beautiful of our species  having before shown how ineffectual those remedies are which are usually prescribed for scrophula i shall suggest some others resulting from our more extensive knowledge of the principles of philosophical chemistry indeed it is to the labors of those who have so extensively applied those means which result from the cultivation of this branch of natural philosophy that medicine owes its rapid advance and when we reflect upon the important discoveries which have resulted to mankind from the happy industry of the present age we are to look forward with the pleasing hopes that the time is not far distant when instruction concerning the causes of the health and disease will be acknowledged to form a necessary part of all rational education and the nearer w approach to this period with less hazard may the analysis proposed by johnson with the plan so

vi  thus while many are straining every nerve to sanction error and superstition under the deceptive appearance of truth and piety others are equally active and sedulous in undermining those truths which philosophy i do not mean that philosophy which has reared its head in france which teaches that there is no god no providence which countenances rapine and murder but that rational philosophy with which the writings of mr godwin mr burke and other such great characters abound with  that which teaches us to do unto all men we would they should do unto us suggested and experience has ratified under the prima facies of error and incredulity both are equally extravagant and absurd and between them the cause of virtue of liberty and of truth and together with it the happiness of mankind are continually receiving fresh wounds which require more the human prudence to heal them of  let us hope that the time is not far distant when the eyes of men will be opened and they will be able to judge for themselves and exercise their own reason without putting an implicit confidence in others who will rejoice to see error usurp the throne of truth  when those narrow prejudices which now obscure their understanding will be done away and they will be ready to confess that upon the only principle on which we can be of essential service to our profession is by accumulating useful facts which are indisputably much wanted and in forming just and natural deductions from them in compliance with this precept we shall unite the observing and rational faculties and accommodate our conduct to that of the be for as lord bacon observes in his nov organ it appears that those who have treated the sciences were either empirics or rationalists the empirics like ants only lay up stores and use them the rationalists like spiders spin webs out of themselves but the be takes a middle course gathering her matter from the flowers of the field and garden and digesting and preparing it by her native powers that in like manner is the true office and work of philosophy which not trusting too much to the faculties of the mind does not lay up the matter afforded by rational history and mechanical experience entire or unfashioned in the memory but treasures it after being first elaborated and digested in the understanding and therefore we have a good reason to hope from the strict union of the experimental and rational faculty which have not hitherto been united  to return to the subject of scrophula we find that an acrimony and acidity were long ago suspected to be the proximate cause of this disease  indeed late writers trace the whole train of symptoms to a prevailing acid with which children in particular are more affected than adults doctor russel in his oeconomia naturae has undertaken a very useful work viz to give a history of the changes that happen to the different parts of the system through the different ages of life but unluckily when considering the alterations of the glands from the effects of the acid with which as i before said children were particularly subject to he has neglected the conglobate or lymphaticandwhat he has said respecting any of the different stages of life has been the invention of a fanciful imagination  in infancy the lymphatic system bears a large proportion to the other parts of the body this proportion gradually diminishes as we advance in years hence we must naturally conclude that it has a peculiar use in children  galens theory of scrophula was that it arose from a cold pituitous humor others attributed it to a redundancy of fluids and as soon as chemisty was cultivated it was traced to a prevailing acidity and this has with some little difference in expression been embraced by almost all writers on the subject down to the   th century  the theory of boerhaave was that it depended upon a spissitude and lentor of the fluids then came to be adopted the doctrine of peculiar acrimony the solidists doctor valli have declaimed much against this doctrine and practice but even amongst those who have most exerted themselves in attempting to reform the science of medicine we find several who have retained some of their ancient prejudices and talked of acrimony in the blood in the same way as it was spoken of in the old school i cannot avoid comparing these physicians to apostates in religion who always retain some maxim of that in which they were educated i do not mean to deny the existence of acrimony altogether acrimonies exist but they are always in their origin the result of a vitiated secretion  analogy and a great number of facts and observations serve as a basis for this opinion my essay on chronic diseases saggio sopra diverse malattie croniche  edizione di pavia anno      has this principle for its foundation thus i am of opinion that in phthisis pulmonalis the lungs themselves form an acrimony of a particular kind that in the rickets the blood vessels which are intended to nourish the bones secret a menstruum or solvent for that portion which constitutes their basis that the scrophulous acrimony is likewise prepared by the lymphatic glands doctor cullen is of this opinion although he at first suspected a peculiar acrimony in the blood that all the scrophulous affections such as the tinaea capitis eruptions in the skin indolent swellings etc are the effects of a morbific humor originally elaborated in the lymphatic system provided these affections are not hereditary or acquired by way of contagion that other acrimonies which affect the skin have likewise their origin in the lymphaticsystem that the spleen under certain circumstances secrets a fluid which attacks the gums or produces ulcers on the skin valli on animal electricity page  0  doctor cullen was of opinion that it depended upon a peculiar constitution of the lymphaticsystem  doctor smith attributed it to a cold matter obstructing the glands and rendering them almost of a schirrous hardness  scrophula according to sir clifton wintringham consists not only in a diseased state of the vessels in the part affected but also in a lentor and acrimony of the fluids which pass through them for the cure he advises calomel mel ppt taken in small quantities and at proper intervals with dilutent and sedative decoctions of chinaroot sarsaparilla sassafras or guaiacum  he directs that mild cathartics should be given at times and on those days which are free from purging that the patient should use the warm bath or emollient fomentations with friction of the part affected in order to drive the mercury to the obstructed vessels when these remedies have been used for some time we are to have recourse to mineral waters and in order to prevent a relapse the peruvian bark and steel should be taken after the cure is completed  doctor fordyce the learned reader on the practice of physic in this city considers scrophula as an affection of the mucus membrane which in consequence of matter forming from inflammation often indeed so slight as to be little noticed part is absorbed by the next lymphaticglands and the disease then assumes its real glandular form  mr white considers a peculiar tenuity of surface or firmness of skin as the cause of susceptibility to the disease which is confirmed by the effect that changes of weather have on it he observes that two kinds of constitution are distinguished by this sort of surface the first is marked by large superficial veins a paleness of countenance a languor in the eye and what is in general termed a want of vivacity or constitutional torpor the other is distinguished by a florid complexion skin easily varying its appearance on the slightest changes vivacity of eye sprightliness of manner and great irritability and acuteness  doctor nesbit the next writer after mr white it was not till after these pages went to the press i had an opportunity of seeing hamilton on scrophula and i was then obliged to doctor hooper the learned author of the economy of plants for the loan of that very ingenious work he coincides with the writers of his day that scrophula is an affection of the lymphatic system and is to be cured by tonics and seabathing offers it as his opinion that scrophula is a disease arising from a peculiar morbid state of surface most prevalent in the early period of life that this state of surface is at the same time connected with general laxity flaccidity and often irritability of the system and that these circumstances exist in a high degree that in this state of furface inflammation attacking any part of the mucus membrane it passes into ulceration and the matter of this ulcer being absorbed by the next lymphatic glands the peculiar from of the disease or the lymphatic swelling next takes place and this matter then elaborated in the lymphatic gland acquires the peculiarity which renders the discharge scrophulous or constitutes the peculiar acrimony of the disease this inflammation of the mucus membrane is often so slight as hardly to be noticed and the fucceeding swelling of the lymphatic gland is considered as the first symptom of the disease and never thought to arise from the former cause the affection of the lymphatic gland then is properly the second stage of the malady and as this matter orginally absorbed is not so acrid as the venereal and others nor the gland itself endued with much sensation the progress of the disease in it is for a long time tardy till it acquires a certain size and affects the external teguments when the disease arrives at its height and a rupture of the teguments takes place a peculiar matter seems to be then formed possessed of various degrees of acrimony from simple ferocity to that of acting a real solvent of the animal fiber  all writers agree that it is an affection of the lymphatic system producing laxity of fiber and universal debility and it is of very little consequence what the cause is capable of effecting this since necessity points out the plan of treatment that of giving tone to the fiber and restoring the general health of the patient the rev mr townsend has informed me that he has remarked that during a period of thirtyfive years in his parish pewsey in wiltshire that females are more subject to scrophula than males those engaged in sedentary employments than such as work in husbandry and they who reside in damp houses or low situations than the residents in more elevated and sandy or gravelly sports he adds that whatever gives tone to the animated fiber must be of essential service in this disease  in a letter to the author   it has already been satisfactorily shown how oxygenated air quickens the action of the absorbents from whence it follows that its use must be highly beneficial in scrophula and experience has proved it so the constitution must be prepared by proper evacuations to receive an additional supply of this pabulum vitae we might at least urge the utility of this new mode of cure till a new theory is established and other remedies offered  the remedies which from time to time have been used for the cure of scrophula are no less multifarious than virtueless  among the earliest and for near a century back the fol digit pur rall hist plant vol i was principally recommended both internally and externally this by degrees like most ephemeral medicines fell into disrepute and then the expressed juice of the waterparsnep sium nodiflorum l s p in doses of two to four ounces in milk was given vide doody apud ray synops ed   appendix with these absorbents were given to correct the acid in the stomach to which were also joined the different woods as guaiacum sarsaparil sassafras serpentaria mezereon etc the neutral salts were extolled as specific like most medicines to which that name is given failed in almost every instance  in the time of boerhaave and heister preparations of mercury and antimony were held in high esteem and if the chimerical and extravagant accounts of the numerous cures which these medicines either separately or conjunctively performed are to be credited we need search no farther for specifics mercury is a very good medicine in scrophula and as it comes so strongly recommended to our notice by mr white who has cured several hundreds with it it deserves attention but i am inclined to think that it is the oxygene the ingenious author of enchiridion syphiliticum speaking of the action of mercury in curing syphilis says page    that mercury taken into the body in its metallic or crude state produces no other effects except in so far as it is a ponderous fluid when used as a remedy for disease it is always exhibited in form of a calx chemistry teaches us that metals are formed into calces by combination with oxygene or the principle of acidity termed also pure or vitalair which enters in the proportion of about a fourth part into the composition of our atmosphere this species of gas is known to be a very active agent in many processes in the animal economy it is that part of the air which essentially maintains combustion and which taken into the lungs supports life it imparts the florid color to arterial blood and is by some supposed to be the principle of irritability itself with oxygene mercury easily combines and readily separates from it or in other words is easily calcined but not retaining the oxygene very firmly is readily restored to its metallic form which by some process is separated from it in the constitution which performs the cure by its stimulating the lymphatics and not the mercury for it is proved by all physicians at least by all who have appealed heartily to its effects that mercury operates as a stimulus that it promotes if aided by other similar powers particularly oxygenegas a vigorous perspiration and is inductive of other phenomenon characteristic of the operation of a stimulus it legitimately follows therefore that the good consequences arising from its use result from this source spilsburys anticorbutic drops  leaks pilula salutaria and all other quack medicines so celebrated and imposed upon the credulous public for curing scrophula and scorbutic complaints have mercury for their basis  and if they ever do any good it must be from the disengagement of their oxygene in the system  besides as an additional argument in favor of this theory it might be urged that as oxygene is the principle of irritability two late physiological writers have endeavored to ridicule this truth the one with a supercilious contempt of all opinions that do not coincide with his own fantastical and absolutely and personally singular system says this particular air this oxygenous matter which vegetables in the day are constantly discharging from the whole external surface of their foliage as urinous and dead and which these pure defecated philosophers dream constitutes the principle of life in which all power essentially resides the immediate and proximate cause of irritability in man saumarezs new system of physiology chap   vol    the other with a similar share of selfconceit tells us that the chemical doctrines of monsieur lavoisier and the electrical theory of doctor franklin are founded on absurd principles and are therefore erroneous i have proved adds he by such arguments as i do not for a moment hesitate to assert are absolutely conclusive whatever therefore may be the fate of my own theory theirs to a certainty are false pearts physiology  to avoid the inconsistencies of their predecessors they have run themselves into greater and have been obliged to attribute new and unknown properties to matter thus instead of solving the gordian knot they have rashly cut it asunder and have involved the subject in greater obscurity than ever  such men may have sacrificed more than hecatombs and may have labored for many years in the investigation of physiological enquiries and all the time have been arguing and writing on principles specifically erroneous a peturbed imagination and with strong prejudices  their opinions then are very far from being entitled to respect or attention  i will not say that these are the men but the peremptoriness of their language their dogmatical mode of argument the haughty complacence with which they speak of themselves and the uncharitable and unmanly censures which they pass upon others whether dead or living render their opinions to me of little value and their assertions of no authority it might not in this place be amiss to inform these philosophers of a truth they do not either comprehend or disbelieve that where the quantity of oxygene in organized bodies is diminished there is also a diminution of irritability excitability or sensorial power and that this irritability is again restored by the restoration of the oxygenous principle the irritability thus supplied to the body through the medium of the lungs is continually wasted by muscular exertion and the action of different stimuli  magna veritas est et prevalabit  a fact of which there does not remain a doubt in my mind and as it has been before shown that in scrophula under all its shapes and modifications there is a deficiency of this principle the principle of life is it therefore not wonderful from this inference respecting its qualities mercury that means of a similar nature such as the inhalation of oxygenegas exercise etc are not had recourse to during its use to cooperate with it to enlarge the basis of our truly limited practice and more completely and triumphantly obtain the advantages which these qualities intimate to us  cicuta has been a very fashionable medicine with physicians in this complaint like new clothes it has its admirers for a time i have given it to several patients and never found it do any good i believe myself that it never did any good in any one complaint the history of this article exhibits to us a curious instance of neglect and inattention to the circumstances accompanying its exhibition as we have demonstrable proofs of its being solely and abstractedly attended to till experience clearly evinces its efficacy and completely shows the want of an analysis of its being solely and abstractedly attended to till experience clearly evinces its efficacy and completely shows the want of an analysis of its qualities and the nature of this disease for no inference respecting its qualities and mode of operation is discernible all that is supposed is only that it is possessed of a specific virtue  the muriated barytes according to the reports of doctor crawford promised to do a good deal in arresting the progress of the disease in other hands it has failed of its boasted virtue nor have i in five cases in which i have given it seen any good derived from it  doctor russel sent his patients to the seaside and ordered them to rub their glandular swellings with the alga marina a cabbage stump would have answered as well with it he gave small doses of calomel ppt and salt water and never omitted seabathing  doctor cullen and the late doctor fothergill both gave cicuta but never without joining mercury with it upon which its success principally depended doctor cullen chiefly recommends the chalybeate waters coldbathings cicuta and common water in preference to sea salt water he condemns the cinchona and speaks in strong terms of exercise friction etc etc  in respect to salt water i never saw it do any good in this complaint on the contrary i think with doctor nesbit that by carrying it too far the system has been weakened by the discharge it has produced and the disease rather aggravated than relieved doctor buchan says that seawater should be only given in gross habits and then only with a view of its acting as a purgative like many remedies it possesses for some time an undeserved reputation and if it ever does service it must rather be as a preventive than when the disease is formed  steel medicines have been universally given and with success this must be attributed to something more besides their tonic powers chalybeates says the ingenious author of the guide to health vol ii have certainly a twofold effect for as the natural vehicle of oxygene and the constituent principle of red blood they strengthen the digestive organs and excite the absorbents indeed all the metallic oxyds excepting the mercurial act in the same manner only in a superlative degree for this reason iron has maintained its empire and whilst we have one oxyd which when conjoined with the vitalair in these cases may be regarded as nearly infallible we need be less solicitous about the rest  the mineral waters on the same principles as i have accounted for the good effects of chalybeates should be early had recourse to by which many of these subsequent stages of the disease will be obviated the waters of bristol hotwell the experiments of doctor carrick show that a wine gallon of     cubic inches of bristol hotwell water is unpregnated with seq grains muriated magnesia    soda   vitriolated soda     lime    carbonated lime    making together of solid

in this country is the chalybeate in many parts of britain these are to be found in almost every field but those chiefly in use for medical purposes are the purging chalybeates as the waters of scarborough chestenham thorp arch nevil holt etc of those which do not purge the waters of tunbridge stand in the highest repute the saline purging waters as those of acton epsom kilburn etc are also in very general esteem but the fountains most frequented by the sick in this country are those to which the minerals impart a certain degree of heat as bath buxton bristol etc   harrowgate scarborough moffatt the island of st michael and most other spas in britain may be used with advantage but at the same time with precaution i have seen them produce bad effects by an indiscriminate use as to quantity and the regimen pursued at the same time of drinking them by which affections of the bowels have come on followed by indigestion this again leads me to speak of exercise which promotes the operation of mineral waters and is necessary to carry them through the system besides which it increases the respiration and promotes the oxygenation of the blood and by this it gives vigor to the system and excites the action of the absorbents  horse exercise is particularly serviceable in serophula morton strongly recommends it for to excite moderate perspiration to strengthen the digestive organs and to shake off the tough and viscid mucus obstructing the absorbents of the stomach and small intestines page     exercise says a learned physician is almost the only cure we know for glandular obstructions indeed it does not always succeed as a remedy but there is reason to believe that it would seldom fail to prevent these complaints were it used in due time  van swieten in his commentaries on the works of boerhaave observes that for want of exercise the stomach and bowels become internally coated with rought phlegm but that by increased respiration and alternate action of the abdominal muscles these viscera are shaken pressed and scrubbed as it were by attrition so as to be effectually cleansed and add ventriculus et intestina lento glutine in interna sua superficie obducuntur valido motu dum corpus exercetur respiratio aucta diaphragmatis et musculorum abdominalium action reciproca omnia haec viscera movet premit ad se mutuo quasi affricat et sic deterguntur

optime digeri queant condimentis potu vinoso exercitio air pro curandum     where the lungs are diseased a seavoyage and exercise on board ship have contributed to restore the health of scrophulous patients which as pliny observes depend more on the length of the voyage than on the climate neque enim egyptus propter longinquitatem navigandi next to exercise in this complaint ranks cleanliness we know says avicenna of many diseases which are to be cured by it alone  in all it ought to be strictly observed  the levitical law of the jews is well calculated for the prevention of those diseases which arise from uncleanliness which enforces ablutions and bathings and makes cleanliness a part of the jewish religion  the children of the lower class of people suffer severely from an inattention to this particular and sauvages enumerates a species of scrophula arising from lice  the bodies of scrophulous patients should be washed every morning with cold water impregnated with vinegar and immediately afterward rubbed dry with flannel  cold bathing if there should be no disposition to tuberculous consumption is attended with many advantages but i fear much mischief has arisen from an indiscriminate use of it and particularly to infants and children that are weakly in the orkney islands it is a custom to plunge children soon after they are born into the river  lest they should from their fathers strength decline they plunge them shivering in the freezing rhine by strengthening the solids and promoting a free perspiration it gives liveliness warmth and vigor to the constitution and nature seems to have pointed out this remedy both to the ancient and new world virgil informs us that it was a custom in italy long before the roman times to dip persons afflicted with scrophula in the cold streams durum astirpe genus natos ad flumina primum deferimus saevoque gelu duramus et undis aen lib   lin     on the subject of diet i have before spoken but here i must again observe that the most nutritious food should be allowed children who show a tendency to scrophula but at the same time they should not be allowed to gormandize repletion carried too far in any disease is as bad as inanition when their appetites have been imprudently indulged an emetic should be given for independent of its clearing the stomach it will have a good effect on the constitution the wise son of sirach confirms this precept and says if thou have been forced to eat go forth and vomit and thou shall have rest ecclus chap xxxi ver    and most certain it is that hundreds have lost their lives and thousands have suffered sickness and pain from their ignorance or neglect of this rule  both hippocrates and celsus give it as their opinion that men should sometimes indulge themselves at feasts great disputes have arisen says the learned doctor mackenzie concerning this rule of celsus his words are modo plus justo modo non amplius assumere some approve of the full latitude he gives others highly blame it lord verulam thinks that excess in eating and drinking should now and then be indulged epulae profusae porpotationes non omnio inhibendae sunt hist vitae et mort page     melchior sebizius on the other hand affirms that by this advice celsus gives full scope to intemperance and sets himself up for a patron of gluttons and drunkards  quibus verbis comedonum bibonum helluonum

lymphatics becoming diseased from exhausted irritability  it is conjectured by some writers that large draughts of cold water bring on a torpid state of the lymphatics and hence it has been deemed prejudicial as common drink for children hudibras who was no bad physician says of all the liquors that men do drink waters by far the best i think but then its qualities should be sic aqua clara

aquae potoribus presently subjoins vina bibant homines animalia eaetera sontes absit ab humano pectore potus aquae   next to water as common drink i shall speak of wine wine contains both hydrogen and carbon in different proportions according to its strength or weakness in fermentation it takes oxygene from the atmospheric air and becomes vinegar but by distillation it yields alcohol or pure spirit which contains about one fifth of hydrogen for    ounces of alcohol by combination uniting with oxygene from the atmospheric air produces    ounces of water as a medicine which by the learned doctor john brown ranks amongst the first in the scale of stimuli scrophulous children should be allowed at least three glasses every day it is much to be regretted that a medicine the human species would do well and certainly enjoy a greater share of health if there were fewer physicians and less physic  and i cannot but admire the prudence of the roman emperor who excused the physicians from the banishment which he intended to the rest of the people when he was asked why those gentlemen should be better used than the rest he answered if i banish the physicians rome will soon grow too populous one of the scotch proverbs says the best physicians are doctor diet doctor merriman and doctor quiet   which takes precedence of almost all others in point of virtue should be so dear as to be only attainable by the rich  the weary says homer who knew the taste of it well find new strength in generous wine  the invention of this wholesome beverage might be justly ranked amongst the greatest improvements of mans aliment and which well deserves the encomium bestowed upon it by plutarch of being the most noble of all liquors the most palatable medicine and of all delicacies the most grateful to the stomach  aretaeus also a physician of the first rank among the ancients commends wine no less than for the cures which it performs i shall cite his own words from the elegant latin version of the learmed doctor wiggan de morb acut curat lib i cap i sed quum metus sit ne in vaporem humiditatemque home dissolvatur unicum subsiduum vinum est celeriter enim substantiam alendo

on scrophulous affections cum multis aliis   it would have been in vain to attempt compressing every thing that is known or has been written on the subject within the narrow limits of a publication of this kind the lumbarabcess which is a true scrophulous affection was unavoidably mislaid till those sheets were printed off i was therefore under the necessity of placing it after the general history of the disease which is intended merely to give the outlines of a work i shall soon publish on a much larger scale  section ix lumbarabscess the lumbarabcess most commonly is seated in the lumbar or the sacral lymphati glands and always in a scrophulous constitution eight cases have fallen under my observation all of which were in scrophulous subjects after the matter is formed it descends and presents itself below pouparts ligament in the form of a tumor along the course of the crural vessels it not unfrequently happens that it makes its appearance in the form of a tense tumor under the glutaei muscles and from this situation of the disease we are to apprehend a fatal termination every opportunity i have had of inspecting the bodies of who have died of lumbarabscess confirms me in an opinion i have long held that the whole thoracic viscera are diseased in common with the sacrolymphaticglands  i opened the body of a man last winter who had lingered out nearly two years with this melancholy disease the lungs were full of tubercles the liver was schirrus the airvesicles were attached to the edge of the lungs  mr abernethy the ingenious lecturer on anatomy and surgery at st bartholemews hospital has recommended a new mode of treatment by gradually evacuating the matter this practice has been adopted all over europe with various success scrophulous abscesses should be treated just in the same way the opening of scrophulous abscesses in general when attended with circumscribed hardness has been found to be productive of harm for these require after artificial opening a longer time to recover than when they are permitted to burst of themselves but an aperture is indispensibly necessary in those collections of matter which cannot be discussed and are attended with no surrounding hardness  for here if the matter be not let out it will often diffuse itself into the cellular membrane and cause a number of extensive sinuses  when hectic fever has much harassed the patient i have found a decoction of the lichenislandicus of service for a more particular account of this disease i must refer my readers to hamilton on scrophulous affections and abernethys surgical and physiological essays vol i  indulging the persuasion that i have traced an outline of a new branch of the materia medica i submit these observations to the public eye and in the words of seneca shall for the present take leave of the subject claiming it as a piece of justice at the hands of mankind if they would judge of any thing i have delivered either from their own sense the cloud of authorities or the forms of demonstration which now prevail as so many judicial laws that they do it not on a sudden and without attention but first master the subject by degrees make trial of the remedies i have recommended and accustom themselves to that subtlety of things implanted in experience and lastly that by due and seasonable perseverance they correct the ill habits that closely adhere to the mind  and when thus they begin to be themselves let them use their judgment and welcome   multum adhue restat operis multumque restabit nec ulli nato post mill fecula
