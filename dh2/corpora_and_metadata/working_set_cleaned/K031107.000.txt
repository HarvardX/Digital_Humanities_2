arthur and emmeline a dramatic entertainment  price one shilling  arthur and emmeline  a dramatic entertainment in two acts taken from the masque of king arthur by dryden and now performed at the theater royal in drury lane with variety of scenes and machinery  the music by purcel and dr arne  london printed and sold by j jarvis no     strand  mdcclxxxiv  advertisement the names of dryden and purcel have made the following performance hitherto regarded as one the best calculated to show the effects of poetry action and music yet the want of a plot sufficiently interesting and varied has prevented it keeping its rank on the stage as a first piece this it is hoped will excuse the present alteration by which the whole of the story with the most approved parts of the music and machinery are compressed into two acts leaving the beautiful scenes of emmeline almost wholly untouched  dramatis personae men arthur king of britain mr kemble oswald king of kent a saxon mr brereton conon duke
