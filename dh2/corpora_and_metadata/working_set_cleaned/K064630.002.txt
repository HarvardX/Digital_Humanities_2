the triumvirate or the authentic memoirs of a b and c  et sermon opus est modo tristi saepe jocoso  hor volume ii  london printed for w johnston in ludgate street mdcclxiv  the triumvirate or the authentic memoirs of andrews beville and carewe nec furtum feci nec fugi  libera per vacuum posui vestigia  hor chapter xcvi the next day after dinner the triumvirate being tempted by the fineness of the evening took a walk to the sea beach between two double lines of elms planted so artfully that every tree of the outward rows covered the interval between two of the inward ones which served to shade you both from sun and wind as effectually as if they had been all placed in the same lines and yet left at the same time the trees themselves their due proportion of air and soil to thrive in this avenue extended about a quarter of a mile and was terminated by a ciump of trees which though only nineteen in number were so ingeniously and paradoxically placed that they formed just nine rows with five trees in each frame a regular hexagon  inscribe two equilateral triangles draw diagonals from angle to angle and the points with the intersections mark out the station of the trees   in the midst of this regular confusion there was a seat formed round the center elm under whose umbrella they sat down together fixing upon that aspect which regarded the sea here they all remained mute for a considerable time as that element had occasioned reflections to arise in each of their minds which occupied their whole thoughts in silent and selfcontemplations at length mr andrews who by being the most certainly unhappy of the three was therefore become more collected and composed than those who remained still in suspense first broke silence and turning to mr carewe claimed his promise who thus readily began his story  chap xcvii the story of mr charles carewe my father is for he is still alive a gentleman of a considerable estate in this kingdom and my mother who died lately brought him a portion of five thousand pounds and was a woman of remarkable beauty i was their first and only son  but my mother happened unluckily to be delivered of me about a fortnight before the usual time  as such accidents are known frequently to have happened and that her character was irreproachable the world contrary to its usual bent refrained from all manner of censure upon this event nor did my father who loved her as well as he was capable seem to receive the least alarm upon that occasion but rather in a coarse jocular manner as was his way applauded his own prowess as he termed it which could bring that matter to bear such was his quibble in about eight months which required nine with another  however about ten years after he began to grow jealous and uneasy about this very article upon the following incident a gentleman who was no way related either to him or my mother who had lived above an hundred miles distant from us and had never even visited at our house happened to die unmarried and left his estate which was about a thousand pounds a year to me appointing trustees for it till i should become of age  this person it seems had been a lover of my mothers before her marriage and was well received upon those terms by her father but more advantageous conditions happening to intervene before matters had been concluded upon she was compelled by her parents to break off her engagements there and was immediately married to my father  these three concurring circumstances her being wrested out of a lovers arms the praematurity of my birth with this adoption joined all together to raise a suspicion in my fathers mind which had never once occurred to him till the last of these unlucky circumstances had happened  upon the first alarm he with a precipitancy which was natural to him and without giving my poor mother an opportunity of vindicating herself from so foul a reproach took a solemn oath that he would never see my face again and immediately hurried me off to the trustees of my fortune to be educated and maintained out of my own patrimony as he styled it  the most interesting part of this story the cause of my excile i knew nothing of till some years after this event when my mother had obtained leave to visit me at the school where i had been placed by my guardians about forty miles from my fathers seat she then related to me the particulars i have just mentioned which she said she would never have informed me of but lest they might by any chance happen to come to my knowledge hereafter from any other hand and then possibly occasion some doubts to arise in my mind which were unworthy of her to obviate which she immediately entered into a vindication of herself with such an air of sincerity and virtue that must have removed all manner of suspicion from any but uncharitable and disingenuous minds  at the same time she afforded me the extreme pleasure of being informed that she had perfectly quieted my fathers uneasiness by giving him every satisfaction that a christian could offer which with his own reflections upon the prudence and nicety and of her whole conduct ever since they had been married had rendered him so conscious of the hastiness and injustice of his suspicions that he declared to her according to his rough manners and illiberal notions that he would actually have asked her pardon if he was not her husband and as for that poor fellow charles said he i am sorry i took that rash oath do you see me but that is past and gone and he must stay where he is now for since i have sworn it let who will go to the devil for a liar by the lord i am resolved that it shall not be me do you mind  chap xcviii here mr carewe seems to be very delicate upon what weak people imagine to be a material point and takes great pains to clear up his legitimacy  but why if the word bastard offends his ear let him assume the title of private relation which is a more polite expression in this case that i here make a present of to the civilians  letters of safe conduct were issued by edward the fourth to the count de la roche natural son to a duke of burgundy who was coming over to engage in a tournament at london with lord rivers this lord rivers was a person of remarkable chivalry and galantry of course he was also a man of letters and translated the lives and sayings of the philosophers from the latin but left out every passage of them which contained any manner of reflection or sarcasm against women a polite and peculiar instance of galantry  who had challenged him these letters were titled pro bastardo burgundiae super punctis armorum perficiendis the being admitted into the lists was an article of honor and therefore the style of the pass could certainly never be intended as an affront  or to take it higher still were not romulus alexander by olympias confession hercules themistocles jugurtha king arthur homer demosthenes and adrian the fourth cum multis every one of them notorious bastards and was not ego gulielmus bastardus the preamble to one of william the conquerors charters but away with such upstart examples as these and if you are tickled with pedigree derive your origin from cain the first bastard of the world  let bourbon or nassau go higher civilians distinguish bastards by the title of natural children in opposition to those born in wedlock which latter may philosophically be divided into unnatural and artificial ones the first be those who are begotten in the ordinary course of matrimony for surely no man can have the face to tell me on this side of threescore that it is natural for a couple already agreed upon the epenthesis the medius terminus or mean point to sit playing at pushpin pitch and toss or hide in the hand while a lame sexton is limping round a whole parish to summon a fat fulldined lethargic parson waddling a snails pace to come and sanctify a deed which by an express text has already been declared a divine command  these slowbegotten brats babes of grace before meat these postponings of love and joy are what in obstetrics midwifry  as shandy chooses to say may be styled unnatural or untimely births as coming into the world contrary to the due course of nature and as it may be called after their time also  by artificial children i mean those succedaneums to generation where barrenness or impotency are repaired by help of medicine or other arts of physic  they may likewise be styled exotics too as reared by cookery in cold ungenial zones such adventitious children such interlopers in families should certainly never be allowed by the english constitution to intercept an estate from the heir at law and for this opinion i shall give you a constructive case in point taken out of whytes reports folio    and page     this thing is said to have happened some years ago at whytes chocolatehouse   a man fell down in a fit at a certain coffeehouse  a bystander immediately proposed a bett that he would not recover  another unconcerned spectator took him up  not the poor patient but the challenger a surgeon who happened to be in the room drew out his lancet and stripped up the dying mans arm but the bettor called out to him to have a care of what he was doing for that he should pay the bett if the man recovered  an appeal was made to the jocky club then present who confirmed the sentence for that the gentleman had staked his money upon nature only not on art  besides these surreptitious heirs seldom ever arrive to the size or vigor of manhood neither but remain a kind of puny insects quivering at a breeze like some of our modern nobility and gentry for my part had i any thing to leave  aside i would much sooner adopt an heir out of a warmingpan than an apothecarys shop and if a woman may be allowed to take medicines to get herself with child why may she not be indulged in getting herself with child sometimes by way of medicine also for physicians have prescribed this cure in some cases  bastards  i ask pardon  private relations are also said to be generally more endowed with spirit wit and genius than the legitimate which must certainly be owing to their parents being both of one mind at the same instant and then in steps the good old proverb that two heads are better than one is there always such a concordance in matrimony and where this is wanting can the offspring of mere ceremony be ever fit for any thing but to make heralds dancingmasters or gentlemanushers quod persolvant debitum languide and oscitanter unde foetus a paretum generositate descisit says lemnius the great physician   these merry begotten too have another advantage over the legitimate as they may be at liberty to adopt a father and show themselves wise children in their choice the legal son may have a scoundrel or a scavenger for his parent buthe bastard must have had bad luck indeed if among the number of galants who may be imputed to his mother he cannot be able like some of the ancient heroes to pick out one that he need not be ashamed of  chap xcix i remained at this school continued mr carewe till i had completed the course i had begun at a former one before my banishment and was thence removed to the university of oxford where i passed through my studies and exercises with as much credit and success as most of my cotemporaries  i do not pretend to say that i applied myself to books with the same sedulity that either of you gentlemen said he bowing would probably have done in so advantageous a situation for letters i was too volatile and fond of pleasure to engage deeply in study but i had ever a certain pride of character which notwithstanding my dissipations and the disadvantages of an independent fortune propelled me always just to fill up the striked measure of my duties though to say truth i seldom heaped it  and in truth the college courses there are so very easy to any person well instructed and attended to at school that i have been frequently surprised to see so many young men of sense and parts sufficient pass through them or rather pass them by with so little credit or advantage for a person may be perfectly idle in a moral sense without being so in a literary one let him but diligently apply only that time to his studies which he cannot find room for in his pleasures and i will answer for it that he shall pass through all his degrees with ease and honor too  but the misfortune is that young fellows do not time enough take up a sense of this economy at the beginning and then like other bad managers the arrear of business they find on their hands often affrights them from adjusting their accounts till it may be perhaps too late to retrieve either their time or their fortunes  chap c while i was at the university i happened to attach myself particularly to a young man who was of the same hall with me he was a perfect adonis in face and person this you may be certain was a matter of no manner of consequence to me but some friendly pieces of service which happened to fall in my way to do him with his sense and gratitude for them mutually endeared us to each other  he was not possessed of any great logical facultles but had a refined taste for poetry painting music and the classics with a remarkable facility in learning languages and he applied himself with such diligence to this superficial part of literature that he could not only read french italian latin and greek but speak them too with perfect ease fluency and correctness  but in the deeper or more abstruse parts of study such as physics metaphysics and mathematics in fine through most of the arts and sciences he was remarkably backward and flow he used to attend diligently indeed all the lectures upon natural philosophy on account of the experiments which he seemed passionately fond and curious about but would very gladly have excused himself from the reasonings upon  he was sensible of this weakness and so mortified at it that he was resolved to use every assistance toward coquering this imbecility and as these were branches of learning in which i had happened best to distinguish myself and who was two classes above him he used frequently to come to my chambers in a morning or invite me to his and entreat me to help him forward with these tough businesses as he termed them  i was flattered and he obliged by these conferences and it was this which first founded our mutual friendship which was afterward farther cemented by a piece of humanity and politeness i had frequent opportunities of exerting toward him after our union and which i am just going to mention to you  he was very lively had a good deal of wit and frolic and was a perfect rake too as far as sitting up all night which he would frequently do but then he indulged himself in no other kind of excess at these or at any other times he would neither drink nor scour the watch nor ransack brothels his amusements on these occasions were conversation reading drinking coffee playing cards walking by moonlight or hiring a coach with two or three friends and setting out at midnight to be early enough to see some fine seat or improvement fifteen or twenty miles off  but some of the idle fellows who happened to be of our parties used to press him sometimes quite rudely to join with them in their debaucheries which perceiving in him such a virtuous aversion to i used constantly to defend him from though i was frequently too ductile myself toward such idleness and excesses  chap ci this harmony had subsisted between us for about two years when my poor friend happened to have a very awkward piece of business fall upon his hands he had been at billiards which he played remarkably well he had much the advantage of the party but men are not at all times masters of their art and he lost the game by one manifest bad stroke  upon this an hasty welchman who stood by and had lost a few shillings on a bett swore by st taffit hur had played buty my friend resented the assertion and quick replied that no person could have suspected him of such a baseness who was not capable of it himself hur plood poiled over at this sarcasm and snatching up one of the tacks he broke it over my friends head who retired out of the room with an i shall find a time sir  it was late in the evening and the poor discomfited squire retired home to his own apartments  he had been reared under his mothers eye who employed the curate of the parish as his private tutor in her own house this was by no means a process of education likely to inspire much prowess and accordingly my pretty effeminate friend had not the least spark of chivalry about him he passed the night without sleep and with very uneasy struggles and reflections between the opinion of the world and his mortal aversion to killing people  the next morning early he called upon me looked pale and disturbed told me with a trembling voice the adventure of the night before and asked my advice after what manner he should conduct himself upon this unlucky occasion i replied that the testy wallian had left him but one rule of action which was reaction and that i was ready to carry him a challenge instantly as there was no time to lose that a thing of this sort should always be resolved on quick and acted briskly for that the sooner we vindicate our character and the shorter time we bear resentment the better  he replied that it was not for such advice he had called upon me on this occasion that he knew full well what the false notions of the world had too strongly established in such cases but that his principles of morals and religion stood more strongly still on the other side of the question he added that supported by these he could muster up philosophy sufficient to withstand a mere popular hiss but that this was not his sole difficulty for his whole fortune depended on the favor of his grandfather who had already declared him heir to two thousand pounds a year but having been bred all his life in the army and totally ignorant of any character but a military one had comprised all worth all virtue in bravery alone and had been often heard to swear by the lord no coward should ever inherit an acre of his estate which had been all purchased by the sword no d  n me he may starve for me  it is fit the dog should rot that begins to stink already with such stuff the young man told me therefore that he came to throw himself upon my address to extricate him out of this difficulty by any possible means i could devise  except fighting  i confessed that it was really a stroke beyond my genius to think of any other expedient but challenging the fellow at least perhaps he may be brought to ask your pardon said i and i shall strongly remonstrate to him that this is the least he ought to do if he is a man of true honor he certainly will do so if not he is a rascal believe me and will take to his heels at the sight of a pistol the die is cast and there is no retreating  i grant you continued i that duelling is contrary both to reason and religion but as every one who lives in a community is obliged to obey the laws of it so may we hope that heaven may make some allowances for a practice which though founded originally in barbarism custom and opinion have long since sanctified almost equal to a law among more civilized nations i clapped him on the shoulder bid him keep up his spirits till my return and so quitted the room suddenly without waiting for an answer  chap cii i crossed the square directly to the apartment of our antagonist whom i found at breakfast with a gentleman commoner from llangefny i told them my errand but said at the same time that i should not have taken this disagreeable commission upon me only with a view of accommodating the strife without bloodshed or dishonor that it was plain to every body mr jones was the aggressor that the rebuke was too severe for the reply and that therefore i hoped   hop me no hops cried out ap shones hur was saucy jack and hur will teach hur manners to a shentleman if hur has mind to fight let hur fight as fight can for by st taffit ap shones will do noting but fight or break more of hur pones jackadandy  llangefny seconded this gallant resolve by saying that it was unpecoming of a shentleman to ask pardon for this was acknowledging hurself to pe in the wrong i appointed the park and the present minute  at my return i found my poorspirited friend in the greatest agitation both of body and mind he asked no question but looked inquiry i really pitied his distress and was so much affected with it that i declare i would readily have fought the sulky south britain myself to have rid him of his fears and danger but that i thought this would be only acting the bravo and have injured my own character without redeeming his  i told him that ap shones was a bear that we must take the field on the instant that matters were unluckily come to that pass at present there was no living among men upon any other terms that as he had been involved in this affair without any vice of his own and was prosecuting it without the least malice but solely in defense of his character and fortune he might well stand acquitted both to god and man that therefore any farther difficulty about the matter must be cowardice not scruple et propter vitam vivendi perdere causas for shame said i shake off this womanish weakness  arouse  be a man etc  during this military oration he made no manner of reply but fixing his eyes upon the floor with a kind of stupid insensibility as if he was falling into a lethargy muttered to himself in allusion to my last expression would to heaven that i were either perfect man or woman  this extraordinary soliloquy struck my ear with surprise but i had only time for this reflection which i spoke aloud that an hermophrodite had neither body nor soul worth saving while i said this i took down a case of pistols which i had charged the day before on an idle affair of my own which happened to pass luckily over and taking my feeble epicaene briskly under the arm hurried it away to the ground without permitting time or power to dissent  we found the enemy had taken the field before us had got possession of the heights were properly stationed and appointed with their bright arms glittering in the sun  a terrible show as i was leading or rather dragging my poorspirited friend up to what i judged to be the due point of distance and before we could attain it or that i could put a pistol into his hand and retire the hasty welchman let fly a shot between us which however luckily missed us both  i then thought this act of baseness a justifiable occasion for saving the credit of my friend and making the quarrel now become my own so quitting his arm and desiring him to move off to the left i rushed up to the station crying out since i find you aim at both have at you for one but before i could form my posture or present my pistol i saw the enemy fairly wheel to the right about and betake himself most nimbly to his heels  llangefny sputtered cursed swore and hollooed after him to stand hur ground like a shentleman but the winds and ap shones were equally deaf and swift so turning to the second i just said a flying enemy is not worth pursuit and a coward below resentment then discharging my pistol in the air and running up to my now undismayed ally whom i found chanting out victoria io triumph io paean with martial air and strides we marched off from the field together returning back directly to my chambers  chap ciii as soon as we arrived my friend threw himselfinto a chair with an heavy sigh i sat up all night said he faintly  doubts and anxieties distracted me i eat nothing all this morning and my perturbations with the hurrying to and from the park have so overpowered me that i perceive my strength and senses beginning to fail bring me a glass of water quickly i saw convulsions seize him i ran for the bottle but before i could reach it to him he fainted sunk and died away  i caught him up in my arms laid him on my bed and plenteously bedewed his pale face with water  but in vain  i searched his pockets for some eau de luce i had seen him snuff up several times in the morning the application had no effect there was no breath to inhale the spirit  his pulse was silent and his eyes still open had now lost all speculation in them  i was distracted  the welchmans shot must have taken place  i opened all his clothes before and lifted up his shirt to search the wound but viewed a spotless form no no the wound was reserved for my heart alone such a polished skin such limbs such breasts such a gender i gazed enraptured on the perfect fair an age of friendship rushed at once to love i besprinkled her lovely body all over and the water applied to parts unused before to cold began soon to awaken sense my hopes revived and thinking the transition again from cool to warm might more quickly complete the cure i stripped off my clothes in an instant sprang into bed and enfolded her lovely body in my arms the roses returned into her cheeks and lips her eyes began to dawn her breath expressed itself in murmuring sighs and her pulse beat tremblingly alive all over  soon as her bright orbs had twinkled into life she quick perceived her situation and endeavored to disingage herself from my embrace i leaped from the bed threw myself on my knees by the side of it entreated her forgiveness urged my excess of passion vowed ten thousand years of love and constancy then caught her again in my arms while through a charming mixture of surprise confusion gratitude fear irresolution and desire the yielding fair one  chorusque turpiter obticuit    after the usual compliments were passed as  he thou most angelic fair all heaven is in thy eyes and bliss immortal in thy arms etc  she oh my dear undoer i would have sustained a thousand martyrdoms sooner than have yielded to any other man alive etc    i then begged the favor of her to let me into the mystery of her extraordinary metamorphosis  but first said she prithee let us have some breakfast agreed  i slipped on my nightgown and brought the teatable to the bedside she would have arose but i would not suffer it she had not slept the night before after breakfast i returned again into bed    i happened after some time to awake from that sweet slumber which the epicurean philosophers style the golden nap while my fair androgenes lay still composed in sleep i raised myself up gently on my arm and with looks of cordial love hung over her enamoured when i had viewed her beauties for some minutes i felt myself offended in delicacy at her wearing a shirt in my arms  the idea it conveyed disgusted me hic mulier haec vir as seneca says of equivocal dress so resolving to have no more of love in masquerade i gently stole it off from her arms then spurned the embracing clothes aside from limbs of such a shape and hue as titians pencil never drew the motion awaked her    chap civ i then repeated to my fair chum the request i had made her before breakfast and she thus readily began my father was a clergyman of the diocese of  you will excuse me and had about three hundred pounds a year in the church but no other patrimony my mother was daughter to captain  you will excuse me there again in a regiment of foot i forget the number she was extremely handsome but had no fortune and my father married her for love she had a sister a year younger than herself a perfect beauty also who was some time after married upon the same terms to a gentleman of a considerable estate in the adjoining county  soon after my mothers marriage her father was commanded abroad and happening to be stationed in the east indies where in a few years he rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel returned home with a fortune of near threescore thousand pounds which he had amassed by spoil and plunder among the nabobs of that country  when my grandfather came home he was presented with two grandchildren one by my mother and another by my aunt they were both daughters which disappointed the old soldier extremely he settled a thousand pounds apiece upon each of the children and laying out the remainder of his acquisitions on the purchase of a considerable estate declared to his daughters that he would make the first grandson his heir a pack of pisskitchens said he by the lord i would rather leave my fortune to the marine society than among a pracel of retromingents that are incapable of serving either their king or their country soon after this proposition my mother declared a pregnancy and about a month later my aunt annonced the same  here i took occasion to observe to my blooming bedfellow upon the grovelling ideas of an husband and wife manufacturing as it were an heir for an estate when compared to the sublime and disinterested joys of two free lovers regarding only their own mutual passion from hence we launched out into the unbounded field of philosophy and sentiment in which scamper she acquitted herself with that spirit and refinement which was natural to her    chap cv triglyph loquitur kate what oclock is it it is very late my dear the watch have just gone eleven well kate then i think it full time for us to   the grammarians rhetoricians and annotators have contrived different points marks and notes for distinguishing the several parts of sentences expressions interrogations exclamations parenthesis references etc quotations etc as the comma colon semicolon period bracket asterisk  etc but there was much wanted a further figure of writing for the quod factu faedum est which mr carewe being a great scholar has happily introduced to us from oxford and which nearly resembles the aposiopesis in rhetoric  this we may style a figure  not of speech indeed  but rather of silence which may therefore not improperly be called the silent minute this is not the hiatus or mark of vacancy which we sometimes meet with in certain broken tracts or imperfect manuscripts but rather the sign of pleonasm the full stop the punctum stans or conjugate point of geometry the punctum criticum of morals the punctum generatum in conics the punctum saliens or punctum lachrymale in anatomy or the point sensible in physics as mr lock terms it it is finally the dropping of the curtain and closing of the scene  this method seems to imitate the ancient chorus of the greek drama which used to hint what was not thought proper to be brought upon the scene of action for it was a rule in those chaste representations never to suffer any thing to appear before the audience which might give offense to decency or humanity  non tamen intus digna geri promise in scenam   therefore all rapes and murders were entirely excluded from their performances so that then a days if a reprobate like some of our modern geniuss should have had a delight in such spectacles he was obliged to step behind the scenes and make sport for himself of which ever kind he was in the humor for either by stabbing an actor or rummaging an actress  but then this expression of before the audience is to be understood literally that is before their eyes for where rapes or murders happened to be any way necessary to the carrying on of the plot they were always related to the public by some bystander in all the particulars of the action i mean the latter only for as to the first whatever diversion there may be it has really so little diversity in it that it by no means affords us variety sufficient for an ingenious description what an infinite number of different deaths has homer introduced in his battles no two men are wounded in the same place nor by the same weapon but truly it is a dull thing enough to think of that poor women whether they will or no can possibly be done or undone but one way  the english stage indeed does not confine itself to such restrictions for there rapes cuckoldoms and fornication are frequently exhibited to the great delight and edification of the spectators and men are stabbed or run through the body and dying in convulsions for a quarter of an hour together before the philosophic audience but the english i suppose are a freer and a braver people than ever the greeks or romans were and all representations partake of the genius of a nation  chap cvi prithee where did i leave off when you interrupted me thou restless chum said she the point we were last upon replied i was the subject of pregnancy i recollect it now answered she and thus proceeded in her story  a little before my mother was delivered my poor father was seized with a pleuretic fever which carried him off in a few days about a month after my mother produced a son who was christened henry after his grandfather by whom he was immediately declared heir apparent and the following month my aunt was also safely delivered of a boy  just as these words were pronounced the college bell tolled three  we arose dressed and issued forth to the outward apartment where i had ordered when i arose to breakfast the most elegant repast that expense or the season could provide during the entertainment we were attended by dumb waiters only to permit the full freedom of conversation and my lively messmate having now thrown off the embarrasment and restraint of a personated character showed her sprightly female soul to be truly epicurean  i remember one reflection she made just as i had finished the flask of champaigne for she drank but two glasses of it were i said she an heathen i should be apt to expostulate thus if as the stoics urge all crimes be equal why should not every vice shock our nature as much as murder does and for my part added she i cannot help imputing it as a sin to the gods to annex the sensations of pleasure to any kind of wickedness whatsoever it is misleading continued she those weak persons who are apt to be governed too much by reason and nature which they unlearnedly take for the most irrefragable revelations  we walked the park in the evening the welsh fuzileers did not appear and we strutted through the throng amidst the applause of all the colleges she engaged me to supper at her apartments i promised to follow her and stepped aside to a milliners to buy some nightshifts for her in order to preserve the decency of appearances for the future  the next morning we awakened about eleven oclock dressed ourselves and came out to breakfast after which she thus continued her narrative  chap cvii this same henry said she was myself my mother in the extremity of her grief upon my fathers death resolving like a chaste matron as she was to live and die a widow concluded that she had then but one game to play for the fortune and determined within herself that let matters turn out as they might she would either bring forth a son or else impose an heir upon her father one should shuffle well who deals for an estate the nurse and midwife were bribed and the cheat passed for my grandfather was so rejoiced and my uncle so mortified at this event that the least thought of matriculation never once entered into either of their heads  my mother reared me with the greatest circumspection imaginable hardly ever suffering me to be out of her sight and keeping my nurse constantly to attend me till i was fifteen years of age which so scandalized the old colonel that i heard him once say to my mother by mars that fellow will soon beget softer brothers for himself upon that wench there  this homebred and feminine kind of education with the detaining me from a public school placing me under the private tuition of an old curate of our parish and never suffering me to mix or play with boys used sometimes to put the old gentleman out of patience you will spoil that child he would say you will rear him a nestcock a coward then fare him well for me for by the lord madam if ever he should betray the least symptom of that vice and disgrace to my blood i will transfer my estate from him to his cousin tommy that boxed a great hulk of a barbers boy so stoutly before my face the other day  my mother upon these occasions would play him off with pleading the slightness and tenderness of my frame which rendered it hazardous to rear me after that careless and robust manner that other boys were treated in it was my grief for his dear fathers death she would cry that has weakened my poor childs constitution in the last month  should i not then endeavor to repair the damage i have myself done him he was tenderhearted for he was brave and such reflections would soften him  as for this same precious quality of courage she would at other times say let it be ever so valuable it must be too dearly purchased at the price of modesty or religion neither of which are sufficiently taken care of in the common or what is styled the liberal education of young men in these days but you sir need have no manner of apprehension about the boys wanting spirit whenever proper occasions shall call upon him to exert it a man may be brave without being forward and a grandson of yours sir though reared in a nunnery would like achilles soon betray that he was born a soldier he was vain and this would effectually stop his mouth  chap cviii i was arrived at the age of fifteen continued she before i had been let into the secret of my real sex and was hitherto kept so totally ignorant of anatomy that i even knew not the difference of gender and was at the same time so chastely bred that the least curiosity or reflection about this matter had never yet arisen in my mind  i used sometimes indeed after twelve years of age to be sensible of a remarkable difference between the kiss of cousin tom and his sisters or my own which puzzled me to account for till i had resolved it into our being both lads of the same age and such near relations and upon the whole fairly concluded that till the heart has become susceptible of passion the natural sympathy of human nature subsisted stronger between those of the same sex  but this philosophical blunder of mine was soon after exploded when i was about thirteen a young fellow who taught the guitar happened to arrive in our neighborhood i had a tolerable voice and entreated of my mother that i might be suffered to learn this instrument to accompany it which she consented to i found a sort of pleasure in looking at the young man though he was not any way remarkably handsome but whenever he took hold of my hands in order to place them properly on the guitar i used to find myself affected with the very same kind of emotion i had before felt when cousin tom used to kiss me certain private intimations or inward sensations i knew not what or why and which i could not possibly resolve into any manner of sentiment or philosophy whatsoever  this alarmed me extremely i apprehended that i was contracting some dangerous disorder and mentioned these unaccountable effects to my mother she blushed cast down her eyes and seemed to be in the greatest confusion imaginable i felt frightened and ashamed from sympathy and filial tenderness without being able to guess or daring to ask the reason but the very next day my musicmaster was dismissed and i declare that i felt myself pleased at it without knowing why  chap cix soon after this event my dear mother began to decline in her health  she had been ill for some time of a slow fever on her spirits which terminated in a gradual decay under which she pined for about two years at length finding herself drawing near her end she called me to her bedside wept blessed and embraced me  here my fair friend poured forth a torrent of pious tears to the memory of her mother which interrupted her story for that time nor did i press her to renew it the rest of the day and really gentlemen said he the recollection of her filial concern upon that occasion is so strongly renewed at present in my own mind that you will excuse me now i hope as i then did her from pursuing this subject till tomorrow evening  mr andrews and mr beville bowed mr carewe wiped his eyes and after taking a silent turn or two along the shore they returned home together supped conversed and parted  chap cx the next evening the triumvirate returning to their former station amidst the clump of elms mr carewe thus proceeded that day said he i dined and supped with my lovely orphan but she insisted on my returning home to my own chambers at night our living so entirely together both at bed and board said she may possibly be taken too much notice of i confess too that i begin to feel myself a little frightened at our adventure since this pause has given me some leisure for reflection besides i really want sleep and rest farewell farewell said she till the morning and i will then call upon you to breakfast  i replied that i was neither ravisher nor bravo that i scorned to take advantage of an accident or a surprise and would never claim any other tie over her than her own inclinations but then my charming harriot cried i out and clasping her in my arms will you not pass the day natural then with me tomorrow if replied she with a sigh and a smile at the same time and pressing me close to her bosom grace shall not return in sleep unsought for i will i bowed she bowed then curtsied  we laughed and i retired  i had now in my turn some leisure for my own reflections i passed part of the night in them i pitied her misfortune and would repair it but how on my own part i examined well my breast and found i loved her not adventure frolic and desire only had attached me to her that mystic gordian knot of two entwined hearts which time itself can never resolve but the sheers of atropos alone must sever was wanting here and on her part she had seemed to have acquiesced too readily in the intrigue her conversation since that event appeared rather too free and though she still preserved her modesty she had methought resigned her chastity with too small reluctance the veni vidi vici may enrich the spoils of war but always impoverishes those of love  however upon the whole i firmly resolved at the hazard nay the full expense both of life and fortune to steer her safely through the aukwardness of her present circumstances to confirm her mind if not in female at least in manly virtues and to be her friend guide and champion too through every incident of life be her future conduct what it might for from me she could never possibly deserve ill who had myself too much undeserved from her already this resolve then serving me instead of a prayer i folded my arms and slept quietly till morning  chap cxi she came to breakfast according to her promise and immediately after reassumed her story my dear daughter said my mother  this expression both surprised and alarmed me i thought that she had fallen into a delirium and was just going to expire i threw myself on my knees by the bedside and taking hold of her hand cried out it is your son it is henry dear madam you are now speaking to i know full well replied she who you are but alas you little know what you are and i am now going to unsold a secret to you that will astonish you much more but will at the same time explain the propriety of that expression which has just now surprised you  she then revealed to me the whole mystery of my metamorphose in the manner i have before related it to you and then concluded her speech in these words my dear daughter said she for now you will give me leave to call you by that name behold with fear and caution the difficult and hazardous course you have for the future to steer alone i would have guided your little bark and guarded this secret from you for some years longer had fate permitted but i must now entrust you to yourself at the most dangerous time of life without the protection of any other matron but your own sense and virtue it is however some consolation to my mind to think that your present mask will screen you from all outward perils and i trust that those principles both of honor and religion in which i have so carefully educated you even from your lisping years have by this time sufficiently shielded you within  i have taught you that religion should be our principal business in this life as it will certainly become our only concern in the next i have instructed you that chastity was a virtue required even in a man how much more then must you think it requisite in your present sex when the opinion of the world and the laws of civil society both join to demand it and for this purpose believe me that modesty is the surest bulwark you can raise it is the advanced guard which upon being assaulted gives timely notice to the citadel for its defense  with this great view then you may have observed that i have all along bred you up rather as a woman than a man giving you the very same education both in morals and manners with your sister that you might have nothing to unlearn should you hereafter at any time be induced to confess your real sex for masculine manners are very incompatible with female morals as liberty in one way is apt to extend itself in an other and the departing from our character in any part of our conduct is so apt to lead us astray that we may not always be able to find our way home again  i confess that i have sometimes repented me of this stratagem continued she more particularly since i have fallen ill beginning to think that this world itself were too dearly purchased even with the least deceit but then i considered again that my nephew will derive a very good fortune from his father and that i have done nothing more by this finesse than establish my own fathers estate in the eldest branch of his family where by the rights of primogeniture it should naturally remain were it not for that too partial distinction between the male and female line which i make little account of as founded more in law than nature that you will by this means have it in your power to do more good and lastly that to discover the secret now would be to brand my own character with an indelible stain the world would then cry it was wickedness in the first instance and weakness in the last  i therefore recommend it to you my dear child said she to continue the masquerade till you come into possession of the estate when you may go out of these kingdoms live abroad and change your condition as well as your garb as you may find yourself inclined hereafter  she then embraced me and i parted from her in the utmost astonishment and difficulty i could not believe my senses i suspected all this novel to be merely visionary either in my mothers mind or my own comprehension of it i ran to my nurse and examined her about this story but she confirmed every particular of it and to put the matter beyond all dispute gave me alas too certain demonstrations of my sex  the effect of this extraordinary discovery in me is not to be described my spirits sunk suddenly like those in a thermometer upon a chilling blast i felt a sensation creeping through my veins like an ague fit with a sort of timorousness stealing over my shoulders like children left in the dark i felt awkward and helpless like one who had lost a limb i wept my fall mourned my imperfect state and like another adam blushed at the discovery of my nakedness in short i was affected all over rather like a person that had really suffered the metamorphosis from man to woman than one who had been but barely informed of it and becoming now a woman indeed i fell from one hysteric fit into another and laughed and cried myself by turns out of them again  chap cxii about two days after my dear mother expired in my arms i grew inconsolable a double distress oppressed my mind to lose her and to find myself my grandfather came to the house the day she died just time enough to give her his blessing and to bid her farewell he lamented her after his manner poor girl she was indeed a good creature but good or bad do you see me we must all go one time or another  then turning to me cried hearkee me youth no more of your piping and sniveling now for though you have lost a mother do you mind you have got a much better thing which is a father child you have been too long tied to an apronstring already but it is i that shall have the management of you now i design you for the army do you mark me but you shall go to the colleges first for though i am not much booklearned myself look you i dont think it absolutely necessary to be a blockhead to be a good soldier no  far from it  i have known several officers fight stoutly enough though they had both sense and learning to boot the king of prussia do you mind is not only the bravest general in the world but the compleatest too in other matters not that they signify in the least believe me as to the main point but what i mean is that they dont hinder as the renowned don quixotte says the pen blunts not the lance   now there is an example for you my boy fellow me that i say  and indeed i dont doubt but with a little of my instructions after you have done with your books for good and all you may i dont love much bragging about the matter do you mind but let me tell you younker for all that i know the thing that is certain nay that is given up to me by all  you may reasonably conclude said she that i was by no means in a temper of mind to relish all this harangue especially the fighting part of it however i looked submission called him my father my only parent now and promised him that his commands should always be the rule of my obedience  he let off the house brought my sister and me home with him and in about a year after disposed of her in marriage with an additional portion of two thousand pounds to a gentleman of fortune in the neighborhood and placed me at this university about two years ago the rest you know too well said she and concluded her narration with a sigh  chap cxiii i dont know how it might have struck my readers as probably few of them may be philosophers but i affirm that from the first i began to suspect this extraordinary personage to be a woman he was not possessed of any great logical faculties but had a refined taste a facility in languages but in the deeper studies and sciences dull and slow he was fond and curious about experimental philosophy but never troubled his head about the reasons of them etc see chapter c second and third paragraphs prithee are not these the characteristics of a woman and need she wear petticoats to declare her gender  epictetus says that attempting to catch weak minds with study is like fishing for custard with an hook now i confess that this image is a very absurd one for it conveys no sort of natural idea huswives never throw custards into a river though the yellowness of the tiber upon the banks of which epictetus lived or rather starved might have led him to imagine they did but if they had surely no alderman of those days unless they were more stupid than those in the present times which i think morally impossible would have ever thought as well as they love them of such an instrument to catch custard with  but your ancient philosophers had but slobbering notions of things in comparison of our modern adepts and as they are generally interpreted more by guess than construction i suppose the sense of epictetus to be that women have rarely a sufficient depth for heavy lading for that the weight which might ballast a ship would sink a boat there may perhaps have been amazons in literature as well as in war but all i contend for here is that let the thracians or samothracians boast what they will there never was an army of them  and this natural economy in the distribution of parts was certainly most admirably designed by providence the eastern allegory conveys the hint to us in a very ingenious manner woman it is said was formed of the slightest rib of man on the left side which embraced the heart now by a metonymy let us substitute the heart for the rib and this we know to be sensible of impression but incapable of reason women therefore were given to us for the sole purposes of feeling and she who would pretend to assume an higher character in life in my opinion well deserves a ribroasting  tacitus says of the english when the romans had established an empire among them jam domiti ut pareant nondum ut serviant they were so far conquered as to become subjects but not slaves and this should be the motto of wives a man and his wife may be compared to the nominative and genitive cases in grammar the first always governs the second never women have confessedly certain privileges but they become rebels when they would extend them to prerogatives the salique law  the salique law  they were designed not to harden our morals but to soften our manners not to stiffen our philosophy but to relax our studies all subjects of taste then as shaftsbury says they may be referred to sensation fall properly enough within their province music poetry painting dress entertainments etc topics of these kinds though we should differ about them can never raise the heat of argument between us sufficiently high to interrupt that harmony and concord which should ever subsist among the sexes for you know the adage de gustibus non etc but should subjects of science once arise then the argument then the vindiction then the scholastic warfare begins for of science man is proud and woman vain  chap cxiv but with regard to the  you know what i mean methinks our friend mr carewe is a little too severe upon our heroine in his late night thoughts chapter cx last paragraph but one  but as noll bluff says he was then become as calm as a discharged culverin this is the only season for philosophy prithee what woman in the world could have behaved otherwise in her situation her mother indeed gave her a chaste education but then she takes and tucks up the poor girls catastrophe in a pair of breeches and pray did you ever know any woman come to good that wore them nay even drawers are too much  they are symbolical  then again what between her gender and her garb she might be deemed to be neither man or woman but both between and between two stools  you know the rest of the proverb  but she resigned her chastity too easily you say  perhaps she could not help it a lock never refuses the key when it is in order this was an adage of vulcans though some mythologists with more probability attribute it to the blacksmiths wife persons may be burned in their beds but would it be fair to style them suicremators upon that account the flame might be none of theirs though the combustibles were the smell of fire it is said renders the senses lethargic and it is too late to fly when the flames surround us  now there are flames even stronger than those of fire and whatever inclines is more powerful still than that which compels us a resisting combatant may wear out his antagonist but to take away the power of resistance is a complete conquest indeed now pray consider the entire circulation of her blood suspended for a quarter of an hour then set a flowing again by the warmth of a young fellows embrace and the tepid tide rushing from the heart into all parts of the body at once consider that she had been in a swoon and that the senses are the first things which awaken chastity might have continued still asleep for in the most virtuous woman it may sometimes be taken napping  the stoics divide man into three parts the body the animal soul and the intellectual one to the first belong the senses or notices to the second the appetites and passions and to the third reason and virtue now as this is the order in which they ripen in our nature it must certainly be the succession of their awakening from our sleep i would have women therefore be very careful to bolt their chamberdoors at night so as to receive timely notice for a world of mischief may be done with two thirds of her before she may possibly be able to stretch and yawn herself into reason or virtue  and as for her acquiescing so readily in the affair afterward i am sure we have all been told that whenever a misfortune happens to us we should always endeavor to make the best of it  but what will clear up my fair clients character beyond every blot of censure is this that the poor child was but three years old at the time of her undoing for it certainly is not fair to compute her age but from the date of her metamorphose which was at fifteen and she was only eighteen at the time of her fall  she compares herself to adam in the first crisis chapter cxi last paragraph  and we may resemble her to eve in the latter one for though i am the first divine that ever had charity or duty enough toward our great grandmother to make the least manner of apology for her conduct in a matter which was certainly more her misfortune than her fault i as champion for the sex must ask you now what sense or virtue could be expected in a brat of a year old and eve was really no more when she first played hell and the devil with old nick for from the very best accounts we have it was the first year after her creation  and this method of interpreting original sin accounts for a difficulty which has ever puzzled both philosophers and orthodoxians with regard to the origin of blacka moors which in the natural way say they must have required another adam or second first man but in the supernatural way i will be bold to affirm that they are undoubtedly the progeny of the devil and eve in conjunctione copulativo and this became farther manifest afterward when this globe came to be distinguished into zones from their naturally taking possession of the torrid one as being most congenial to the fiery constitution of this hellish breed  chap cxv we lived together for some time in the pleasantest way in the world by mingling love and books together till my poor pope joan began to perceive herself to be with child at first she knew not what ailed her and did not in the least suspect the truth of the matter and indeed how should she she was always considered as a boy and therefore women never spoke freely before her as it is possible they may sometimes do among themselves and her mother died and her nurse was discharged too soon after the discovery to instruct her in the nature of those things  and indeed she has since declared to me that she had not the least notion of any couples being capacitated to beget children except a married one that having heard of the mystery of marriage the wedding ring the indissoluble knot that man and wife were thereby rendered one flesh etc she had carelessly concluded that there must have been some sort of a free masons secret in the matter which the priest had the sole power of initiating the couple into when he performed the ceremony and that she had imagined what had passed between us might have been indeed the unchaste joys of lovers but could really never have conceived them to have been the chaste duties of the marriage rites  but when she was made sensible of her mistake she grew extremely unhappy she upbraided me severely called me seducer betrayer etc in one breath and in another pressed me to marry her i replied with a line in a scotch song jockey would loo but he wona marry adding that ceremony among friends was absurd but to take up forms where one should leave them off ridiculous to the last degree that we had really as much matrimony already between us as might satisfy any two reasonable people and that a clause of surrender always raised the value of any tenure that marriage would be quite inconsistent with the plot that was carrying on for the estate that it must expose us to the necessity of making a new confidant which would certainly be too idle an hazard to run for a bare punctilio that i would take care to extricate her from this difficulty with sufficient address and it would be time enough then to settle plans for future conduct  this sort of jest and earnest apology silenced though not satisfied her but served however to render her seemingly easy for the present she kept entirely within her own apartments wore a loose bagniane wrapped about her and received no visits except from me on pretense of studying for a fellowship  about a month before she was to lie in the long vacation happened to come on and i took a private lodging for her about forty miles from oxford we set out at night in a postchaise together and the next morning she assumed an entire female garb that i had supplied her with long before at college for the pleasure and variety of seeing her a woman sometimes when we used to shut ourselves up entirely in my chambers  chap cxvi ladies i am much afraid that there is one particular in this story which will shock your faith extremely a girl of eighteen not to know how a womon is got with child a probable tale truly and yet i do really think such a thing may be very possible first because she affirms it next because her mother and her nurse guarded her equally from the converse of man and woman and they were much in the right of it to defend particularly against the latter for fear of a discovery it is mothers maids that debauch all boys i will tell you the story of my first surprise some time or other when i am in the humor and i assure you it will entertain you vastly besides might she not have read the story of jupiter and ganymede the formosum pastor corydon ardebit alexim the account of sappho and the lesbian maids the comedy of loves labor lost or concubitus sine lutina etc and is not a mixture of learning apt to breed indigested ideas and lead one into very unphilosophical inferences  and in the last place who could ever imagine from the mere light of nature alone or from any manner of a priori reasoning without the assistance of experimental philosophy or a posteriori evidence that a woman could possibly be got with child so ridiculously  i have really known a few instances myself of this ignorance in girls who have lived very far in the country and i remember a young lady once of about seventeen who upon hearing a gross expression one day by accident came up to me and repeating it asked me as a scholar what was the meaning of that hard word  i met lately among some french tracts with an authentic story of two young peasants which i will relate to you after my own manner not having the book by me take it as follows  the story of lubin and annete their parents were both poor and lived in a little village on the river seine in france which consisted only of their two cabbins and huts for their cattle the fathers and mothers on both sides happened to die before lubin was eighteen and when annete was about sixteen they were cousin germans and both extremely handsome  as there was no fortune in either of their families worth the while of guardians executors or trustees to pillage them of each of the heirs took peaceful possession of their respective claims which consisted of a few cows some sheep goats and poultry with a small vineyard which their fathers had held in partnership before  these young persons had been bred up together from their infancy and had contracted a mutual passion for each other without knowing it taking it to be only the usual warmth of friendship when the last of their parents died they joined their stocks lived in common and in the true state of innocence together  there was a small market town within two miles of their hamlet to which one or the other of them used to carry a lamb a kid or any thing else to sell just as they might have them fit to dispose of one day annete went alone to market with a basket of chickens on her arm the bailiff of the town took notice of the roundness of her waist and asked her if any thing ailed her no indeed sir said she dropping a curtsy i thank you  i am as well as ever i was in my life thank god what makes your hips swell so of late then my pretty annete indeed sir i cannot guess the reason but i find myself growing fat every day without knowing why for i labor as hard as ever and dont eat drink or sleep a bit more than usual  you are married then i suppose replied the bailiff no indeed sir you have got a lover my pretty annete no indeed sir i never saw one in all my life pray tell me who sleeps with you anights now my pretty lass why my cousin lubin to be sure answered the innocent then cousin lubin is a rogue said the bailiff and has got you with child my pretty annete upon this expression she stared asked how and then clapping her hands for joy cried out je ferai peute etre un petit lubin  the fair raravis returned home to her cottage extremely rejoiced at this news and chid her lubin for not letting her into the secret before he was as much surprised as she and declared his equal ignorance of the matter saying it is an odd way truly of getting children by romping and tickling one another  the priest of the parish hearing of this extraordinary story came to the village and rated them soundly about living in so criminal a state together this surprised them both still more than the other they replied like simpletons and illiterates as they were that they could not possibly imagine themselves to have been guilty of any manner of crime in what had passed we had neither of us any envy hatred or malice in what we did  we injured no body and we pleased ourselves to which lubin added can a sin and its contrary be both criminal at the same time are we guilty in killing one person and in bringing another into life also  tush tush cried the priest you add presumption to your crime by daring to reason with me but is it possible added he that you can be so very ignorant as to doubt that the bringing a bastard into the world is a crime the holy father then will kill it cried out the simple annete and leaning on lubins shoulder wept bitterly  the honest lubin then turning to the priest fell upon his knees saying o father i ask gods pardon and yours for happening though by mere accident to get a child without your consents but i am most willing to marry my cousin this instant in order to prevent such wickedness for the future  son replied the father i am as willing as you can be to stop up the gap of fornication and lay open the gates of chastity but it is proper first that you acquaint me what kind of relation you bear to this young woman i think you styled her cousin a while ago pray what degree of kindred does she stand in toward you  good father replied the distressed lubin annete is my first cousin what cousin german yes father the same this is more unlucky still replied the priest for it is not now in my power any way to accommodate your misfortunes as the church absolutely forbids all such consanguineous unions  upon this last sentence the unhappy innocents retired home weeping together to their cottage where from scruples of conscience they resolved to keep separate beds for life they continued in this state of divorce for some time pining away and languishing at each other till the lord of the manor having been told their story sent for them both and after examining them and being fully convinced of their real simplicity and innocence took compassion on them and obtained a dispensation for them from pope benedict the fourteenth to beget good catholics for the future according to form  chap cxvii the ingenious monsieur marmontel was so struck with this story that he has worked it up into a pretty novel and inserted it among his writings under the title of histoire veritable in order to distinguish it from some others which were only founded in fiction in the preface to it he speaks thus if it be dangerous says he to render young people too knowing it is on the other hand rather more so to let them remain too ignorant for there are offenses against laws which do not appear to be so against nature and i am here going to afford you one instance how far innocence may err when the bandage is kept too close upon the eyes  you may see ladies from these examples joined to that of mother eve that a state of innocence is a state of fall therefore as i have ever known you to swallow advice as the sand does rain and to keep both ears open to it that it may go in at one and out at the other i would recommend it to you to be always as to be sure you are already innocent as doves but wily as serpents at the same time  but in truth girls i cannot contrive what in the world to do with ye your mothers are quite at a loss between freedom and restraint to know how to educate ye it really requires a great depth in natural philosophy for ethics will not do alone to be able to conduct ye safe through life considering ye still as free agents therefore women are unequal to the task and men are improper for it  what is to be done then for my part i prefer the eastern manner of cloystering ye to any other for as women must be slaves either to opinion or restraint i think it much less severity to put their chastity out of danger than to annex infamy to the lapse of it women are in a pitiaable condition indeed our sex seduce them and their own preven their reformation  chap cxviii in our new sojournment we kept ourselves quite retired nor ventured to stir abroad except to take a short walk in the evenings in a walled garden which belonged to the house where we lodged we neither of us brought any servants with us from the university for fear of a discovery but i hired a man and she a maid in the village where we were situated  i suffered my share of anxiety as well as she during this interval till one night about ten oclock after we had supped the pains of labor came upon her i called up the midwife nurse and landlady to her and then ran up to my own room which lay just over here is her groans pierced my ears and heart i could not stand them i ran down the first flight of the stairs in order to get out of the house but as her pains increased her cries became so shocking that i had not resolution enough to pass by her door  i ran back again and locked myself in like one pursued for a murder  i felt like jaffeir when he had betrayed his friend to the rack i opened the window with a design of leaping out of it into the garden when i heard her screeches subsiding to a moan and the landlady soon after running up stairs cried out your wife is safe and i wish you joy of a son i hastily opened the door caught her in my arms and thanked her for the joyful news but adding in a generous transport it is well but by heaven i never will get her with child again unless she vexes me the good woman cried tush you fool is that the way you will reward her labor and ran laughing down stairs  this happy event much relieved both our minds and our joy was doubled in our present awkward circumstances that it was not a daughter we congratulated each other upon this occasion and as we were both of us university lads we resolved to have all the ancient ceremonies performed in honor of our terrae filius accordingly on the fifth day we passed him through the rites of the amphidromia and appointed the festus nominalis five days after for his christening both of which were executed according to the most exact formalities of the greek and roman antiquities  when the curate asked me the name of the child i answered hermaphrodite the parson mistaking the name for the nature of the infant refused to go on with the ceremony it is not orthodox said he to give such a creature baptism it can never be a good christian that is plain how can it make a fair show in the flesh how serve the lord with all its members how be fruitful and multiply all which things i do affirm to be required of a perfect christian  i laughed at the doctors mistake and told him that this was a patromatronimic given to the son of mercury and venus and that i looked upon ours also to be the child of wit and love alluding to the mothers beauty and my being reared in the lap of the muses  may be so may be so replied the doctor i have forgot all your heathen stories entirely  an heap of idle inventions all of them i stick to the bible  i am sure there are as extraordinary ones there  one need not turn to the pantheon to look for them and if they read the bible at oxford instead of your ovids metamorphoses i am positively sure and certain that it would do every bit as well  nay better too for one may learn a great deal of good out of the bible moreover but christianity is disregarded nowadays and all our youth are bred up perfect heathens  in the interim of this discussion the nurse had slily unpinned the childs rocket stripped up its flannels and presented it heels foremost to the doctor he then put on his spectacles which he had been twirling about his thumbs during the harangue and after examining the infant matriculatively cried ay ay this will do this child is within a very few words of becoming an excellent christian and then proceeded to the consummation of it  after the ceremony was over she smiled at my whim in the nomination of the child but desired lest perhaps other people might be led into the same mistake with the doctor that we should stick to the male part of the derivation and style our son hermes only for the future this i readily agreed to and the doctor concurred with us saying it certainly was a much more christian name than the other  during her confinement here i never stirred from her bedside except when i retired to meals or that she fell into a slumber reading to and coversing with her constantly to keep up her spirits and as we passed under the character of man and wife and that i had changed my name we had this same curate of the parish to read prayers for us morning and evening and when she was able to sit up at meals i asked him frequently to dinner which was a great relief to us both as she was become very reserved and thoughtful and that i began to grow intolerably uneasy at the confinement  chap cxix about a fortnight after she was brought to bed gentlemen continued mr carewe an adventure happened to me which i shall relate to you here in its proper place  my landlord took me aside one evening and told me that there was a lady just come to his house who desired to speak with me i never staid to inquire who she was what she was or what her business my only question was where is she he led me down stairs to the parlour and opening the door cried madam here is the gentleman you want and retired  i walked into the room and a lady richly dressed remarkably tall finely made and about five and twenty rose gracefully from her seat curtsied and moved forward i bowed and we advanced briskly toward each other i to salute her and she to shut the door which she did and bolted it too at the same time taking a kiss en passant then returning to her seat and placing me close by her she turned a very handsome face toward me and thus began  the freedom i have taken with you sir must certainly surprise a stranger but the business i have to propose to you will probably do so much more i have been married these seven years to a gentleman in this neighborhood and my husband has really behaved toward me during all that time not indeed as well as it was possible but as well i suppose as men generally do to their wives so that upon that score i have no manner of complaint against him  how irksome dear sir must it then be to a woman who has no charge to bring against an husband on her own part to be reduced to the sad necessity of urging one and of the blackest dye too against him on a foreign account without malice resentment or the least manner of provocation to impel her to it  yet such however is my unfortunate situation continued she applying her handkerchief to her large blue eyes for my husband has been lately guilty of a most barbarous cruel and premeditated murder which not only cries aloud to heaven for vengeance but to me in a most particular manner for justice as i am perhaps the sole person alive who can detect this villainy as being the only one who knows any thing of the malice praepense which could have induced a man in other things tolerably good to perpetrate so atrocious a crime  nothing you may be assured dear sir continued she could have induced me to enter into such a prosecution but the clamorous cries of justice and of blood which supersede all other obligations and make me dread the divine vengeance on myself as an accomplice should i suffer my ears to be shut against their urgent calls  you may think it extraordinary perhaps that i should address myself to you who are a stranger and a man of no power or authority in this shire but should i have applied to any of the neighboring justices i was afraid as they are all my husbands friends lest they might privately convey an hint to him to make his escape to lock me up or probably by some more effectual method to put it out of my power ever to appear against him  i bethought myself therefore of placing myself and my cause under your protection for having seen you several times at church here and taken notice of your respectable appearance as a young man of fortune and fashion and being informed upon inquiry that you were come to reside for some time at this house i believed that your interfering in this matter would not only assist me to obtain justice but also screen me from the violence and resentment of my husband upon this melancholic occasion here she closed her charge continuing still to weep as she had done almost through the whole of her harangue  i was shocked astonished and concerned for gods sake madam said i what are the particulars of this horrid murder what inward consciousness have you to accuse him upon or what outward circumstance to prove him guilty of the fact sir replied she the body was found murdered in a pit and the persons horse lay killed just by him to prevent his running home to raise the alarm too soon my husband was the last person known to be in his company and has for some time suspected him of an intrigue with me since which surmise he has never suffered him to come within his doors bearing him constant grudge and deadly malice  chap cxx i told her that i did not see sufficient grounds upon the whole of the story to take away a mans life who had any rank or character in the world but your internal evidence madam said i which seems the most material with you will never sway nor ought it with a jury i therefore advised her to return home to say nothing of her intended prosecution which should for ever be buried in silence with me to leave the detection of this crime to providence and the punishment of it to the laws for that if there was any foundation from facts or circumstances to charge the murder upon her husband there would probably soon arise more natural and unquestionable prosecutors against him than a suspected and provoked wife could ever possibly be deemed  what effect can your evidence probably have added i except to fix the indelible stain upon your own character of two the most abominable and unjustifiable crimes in nature an offense against an husbands bed and an attempt upon his life the first may ever remain problematical if the latter does not add demonstration to it the adultress will hunt for the precious life and with regard to him continued i it must rather serve to acquit than condemn him for the very cause of your suspicion may in some sort be deemed the reason of his excuse  the highest injury and mortification a man can possibly receive went i on is from an offense of this nature  the resentment and provocation must therefore rise in proportion to the wrong this is so well understood and admitted of by legislators continued i that there is always an indulgence shown in the administration of the laws upon the fatal effects of any sudden transport of passion on such an occasion  but persons may not always be able or sufciently prepared to execute their resentment upon the first discovery and as the christian code by the jewish laws the adulterer and adultress were both stoned to death has not thought proper to adequate a penalty to the offense  for what are fines or imprisonment to a mans own sense of the wrong  i really think that a resentment shown upon the first opportunity as well as upon the first provocation may be perfectly agreeable to reason though not it seems to law he will not regard any ransom neither will he rest content though thou give many gifts nor may this be deemed of the nature of malice praepense neither while the injury continues still instant to the soul and that the sense of it may rather gain strength from reflection for jealousy is the rage of a man therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance  now to sum up all madam said i and rising from my seat give me leave to add that the justice which you say and which i shall still preserve charity enough to presume you are actuated by is much mistaken in this point for there are believe me let the stoics urge what they will certain duties within duties which may render that action which would be just in one unjustifiable in another  chap cxxi she seemed extremely confounded rose and walked toward the window wiped her eyes and then turning about to me with a constrained composure in her air so young a preacher said she i have never heard before and you may be an orthodox one too for aught i know but this i am sure of that after the steps i have already taken this day in first charging my husband with the murder and then eloping from him it is now too late for me to think of returning home again even should he receive me how could it be possible for us ever to live on any terms together after his having suspected me of adultery and my accusing him of murder  i have therefore no resource left me now said she with a sigh and countenance full of distress but to pursue this point at least so far as to frighten him into some terms of separate maintenance which after what you have said to me upon this extraordinary occasion shall i assure you be the utmost of my malice against him and surely sir said she catching hold of my hand and falling on her knees before me you will not refuse me your humane and generous assistance so far at least as may be requisite to extricate an unfortunate woman out of so shocking a dilemma  i raised her up in my arms and  i am quite ashamed of it gentlemen said he looking at andrews and beville  i could not refrain from embracing her i had really conceived the most virtuous abhorrence of her crimes but  i dont know how it was i found the kissing her most wickedly pleasant  i then promised to take her person under my protection though i would not patronize her vice and telling her that it would not be proper for me to be seen any more in her company for the remainder of that evening i left her in the care of my landlady and retired to see how my fair invalid had rested since i had parted from her  i found her just awakened from a refreshing slumber and with that steady calm temper which she had constantly preserved through the whole course of her confinement in this place she was thoughtful but not grave easy though not gay and had that kind of even cheerfulness always about her which flows rather from a composure of mind than a mirthfulness of heart  i did not mention a word of my adventure below stairs and had given the same caution to the whole house as i was afraid that the shocking circumstances of the story might have too much affected the weakness of her spirits in her present invalid state and that possibly it might have alarmed her with a little jealousy also as there was sufficient reason to suspect that the ladys chief concern about the matter might have been for the loss of one galant and her principal end in applying herself to me be for the compassing another  i sat and conversed with her till her nursetender dismissed me and then retired up stairs to my own apartment read for an hour or two and went supperless to bed  chap cxxii the next morning about eight oclock i was awakened by some body coming into my chamber and as i never shut the windows at night in order to rise early i perceived a gentleman whom i had never seen before walk into the room in boots with a pale frightened look and a pistol in each hand i called out to him to stand and declare his business instantly or i would fire at him leaping into the floor on the opposite side of the bed and snatching up one of my pistols which lay on a chair just by it  he answered me as quick as i could speak in these words dear sir i ask pardon for this abrupt appearance and be assured that i wear not these arms to offend you but to defend myself and so far from meaning to assault you sir i am rather come hither to require your protection i then desired him to lay down his arms on the table and take his seat till i should have put on my clothes he did so but while i was dressing myself proceeded thus  i am come sir said he to complete the adventure you had with a certain lady yesterday evening i am alas the unfortunate husband of that wicked woman who in revenge for my not having repudiated her some time since which i am now convinced she was disappointed in is at present endeavoring to set herself free from the marriage chain by the most diabolical stratagem imaginable she eloped from me yesterday evening continued he after some very warm expressions on both sides she quitted the room in a rage and left me in such astonishment and confusion that i did not know she had gone away from my house till the bell rang for supper  i then sent servants all round the neighborhood to inquire after her and about five oclock this morning one of them returned back and informed me that she had been seen alighting at this house from behind a tenant of mine who lives in a little village near me i was still sitting up so mounted my horse and rode off directly hither  as soon as i arrived i inquired from the landlord what he knew about her and he told me that when she came to his house she desired to speak with the gentleman stranger who lodged here that he immediately introduced you sir to her and then left you together in the parlour that you remained there but about half an hour and then retired up stairs to your own apartments for the remainder of the night  i then desired him to show me the chamber where she lay and having left my pistols in his charge for fear of alarming her i went softly into the room opened the windowshutters and then going to the bedside gently put aside the curtain to see if she was awake she opened her eyes just at the time looked at me for half a minute before she could recollect herself then shrieked out and hid her head under the clothes  i sat down by the bedside and desired her to be under no manner of apprehension of any violence from me that i only came to expostulate with her calmly upon her hasty expressions and precipitate flight and also desired to know how far she intended to carry her wickedness and disobedience  she then uncovered her head and with a steady countenance replied that she really deemed me a murderer and had therefore fled from my house in fear of her own life that on the way her conscience had urged her to a prosecution against me and that despairing of justice from any of my own quorum she had applied to a stranger for assistance who had generously promised it to her  by this time i was dressed and sitting down by him repeated to him all the circumstances of the charge his wife had brought against him i told him that there was certainly foundation enough to put him upon his trial at least that guilty or not this affair must be attended with considerable scandal trouble expense and hazard but that be he criminal or be he not taking all circumstances together i compassionated his unhappy situation and if he would heartily relate to me the whole truth of the story i would be his friend so far as to put a stop to the iniquitous and unnatural prosecution on his wifes part  sir replied he with an expression of joy and surprise in his countenance your generosity and humanity have won a secret from me which i never should nor indeed ought to have revealed to any other person breathing but now said he rising and lifting up his hands and eyes to the ceiling with the same sincerity with which i entreat of heaven forgiveness for my offense i will confess my crime in this article fully to you so saying he returned to his seat and thus began  chap cxxiii my father died soon after i became of age and left me who was his only child a clear estate of about a thousand pounds a year i lived an idle debauched life like other young men till i was two and thirty at that unlucky era i first saw this woman fell in love and married her without a fortune  she was then about eighteen and from what she appears to be this day one may easily judge what a charming person she must have been at that age we lived in perfect harmony together for near six years during which interval she bore me one son and a daughter  about a year ago and near the unhappy end of this too happy period a gentleman arrived from the university at his seat about four or five miles distant from me as this is a neighborhood in the country and that i had been formerly well acquainted with his father i paid in due course the first visit to him  he was a young man of about two and twenty not handsome but of a genteel person and had that peculiar easy air about him which denotes both birth and breeding he was hardly endowed with even a moderate share of understanding but had that kind of liveliness and nonchalance in his manners which is too apt to captivate women because it does not alarm them sufficiently to put themselves upon their guard  in about a month after he returned my visit and staid a week with us he was all frolic and dissipation he gave a shift to be run for by the girls of the village a hat to be cudgeled for a saddle for a horserace and tobacco to be grinned for by old women he made me send for a fiddler and summon all the young people in the neighborhood to a ball and used to din our ears in the morning with the noise of his hounds and french horns  he gave us an invitation at parting and in a few days we returned his visit the same kind of active idleness and extravagance continued while we staid there strange giddy creature my wife would sometimes say he is as innocent and undesigning as an infant  but he will run through his fortune and constitution as other young heirs do before he has given himself time for the enjoyment of either a friend such as you are she would add who has so much the advantage of him in years and sobriety must be of vast service to prevent his falling into the hands of harlots and sharpers i thought as she spoke and therefore encouraged a frequent intercourse between us  chap cxxiv i have seldom known a good end come of inmates of this kind in a mans house the husband is sometimes en deshabille both in temper and habit the friend always decked out in dress and cheerfulness the husband careless the friend attentive  the husband old and the friend new novelty and comparison give the advantage freedoms increase and it is never fafe for a woman to be familiar but with her husband there are certain periods in female virtue which philosophers style critical minutes when chastity by long watching i suppose begins to nod and the close besieger must sooner or later catch her off her guard  an old and faithful servant who had been butler to my father and continued in the same station with me came to me one day about a month ago and after a good deal of hesitation and difficulty gave me some hints of a criminal intercourse between my wife and my friend i caught fire and in a peremptory tone commanded him to reveal all his knowledge in that affair without the least reservation or disguise  he then told me that the morning before as he was going to wind up the clock on the staircase he saw him going into his mistresss bedchamber i was surprised at first said the poor old man but considering his free careless manner that he might not have known your honor was up and called in to rouse you or might have imagined she herself was up and have gone in to hurry her to breakfast i did not harbor much suspicion at that time especially as i saw you all soon after at the teatable together and that i did not perceive the least manner of guilt in either of their countenances which i supposed that no wicked persons could ever disguise  but this morning continued he as i was coming down from my own room later than usual with my shoes in my hand to avoid making a noise as i passed by your door i perceived him again coming out of my mistresss chamber upon which i turned back for a while to let him pass by as if unnoticed i then began to grow uneasy in my mind said he and thought it my duty to inform your worship of such practices  i was struck dumb for some minutes and then directed him to lie on the lurch the next morning and the moment he should see him go into the room to come and acquaint me of it i went immediately into the closet and charged my pistols afresh i endeavored to appear easy and composed all that day i did not stir out indeed but walked about the parlour humming a tune or sat in the window reading a pamphlet till dinner in the evening we played parties of picket together and i took notice of many freedoms between them both in words and action catching hold of her hand when she cut the cards or presented them to him to be dealt free speech and arch looks with other ribaldry of the same sort such impertinences might have passed unnoticed at another time but trifles light as air etc we supped and parted about eleven oclock all in seeming harmony  the anxiety of that night is not to be imagined i doubted i believed  i hesitated i resolved  i hoped and i despaired i recollected a thousand circumstances to think her innocent  a thousand others to deem her guilty her touch digusted me i lay on the stock of the bed slept little and waked in a perfect fever she slept sound and did not in the least perceive my disturbance  the next morning i rose early in order to give iniquity fair play and retired to my study where i waited with impatience till my confident came to tell me that my wife was come down to breakfast and he had not observed any thing of what he had lain in wait for though he had kept his station ever since he heard me go down stairs till that every moment  o sir cried he out at this period of his discourse is it not a shocking thing to say that i felt myself disappointed at this report but such however was my wretched situation delayed revenge is like a late feast the appetite palls upon it this day passed over in the same manner as the foregoing  chap cxxv the next morning the butler came running to me out of breath and told me he had just then seen him go into the chamber i desired him to remain upon the spot i left him till i should call him up i walked up stairs directly went into the room with a pistol in my hand and shut the door after me it is too late to hide your baseness now villain said i in a low voice but i will notwithstanding spare your life rise instantly open the window and leap out into the garden then return into the house call for breakfast and leave the rest to me  he flew to obey my commands and as soon as i had shut down the window after him i opened the door and going to the stairhead called up john friend said i i cannot find him here but do you go in and seek for him he declined it till i presented the pistol to his breast he then searched the room diligently and upon his disappointment looked aghast and trembled  old man said i fear nothing your information has shown an honest disposition in you but your eyes begin to fail you you must have mistaken me who might have gone in and out the two former mornings and this day you must have taken one of the maids for a galant the poor fellow then threw himself upon his knees acknowledged his error crying that threescore and ten had rarely eyes to be depended upon and entreated forgiveness both of god and us  i granted his pardon said i would intercede with his mistress bid him never mention a word of the affair and desired him to go down stairs and lay the teatable but how was his surprise augmented and his mistake confirmed when he met the gentleman in the parlour and entreating for breakfast saying that he was obliged to set out for london that very morning  i then returned into the chamber where my wife had lain silent and motionless during the whole transaction she rose up on her knees conjuring me to believe her innocent the truth of which she offered to certify to me by the most sacred oath she said that the young man had always a giddy free romping way with him which she had frequently reprimanded him for and had finally threatened to inform me of it if he should continue his impertinence but that in thought word or deed a vestal was not purer than she and then burst into a flood of tears  i replied that i hoped for my own sake and had charity enough to believe for hers too that no criminal intercourse had ever passed between them that her indiscretions had been indeed almost unpardonable but that i had given sufficient proof of my having deemed them only such by my command of temper upon this trying occasion with the stratagem i had made use of in order to screen her character even from a footmans censure and that i hoped her conduct would thenceforth become thoroughly reformed from a grateful sense of my behavior and a proper condemnation of her own  she did not come down to breakfast but after the table was removed and the coast clear the gentleman made me many asseverations and swore all the usual oaths of men of honor upon such occasions to which i answered that my wifes innocence rested not upon his justification that i dared not even to think her guilty though i believed him to be a villain which i would then resent more emphatically by deeds than words if the regard i had already shown by my late contrivance toward her character had not reprieved him from my vengeance he acknowledged his inhospitality asked my pardon and retired with precipitation and confusion  chap cxxvi my behavior upon this occasion continued he must appear very extraordinary to you and so indeed it was but my reasons for it were these had i found them together the first day as i expected i should certainly have shot him through the head and might probably have dispatched her too immediately after him but the disappointment and the interval had given me time for reflection my resentment was by no means abated but my prudence and my pride had tied down its hands  i did not think her actually guilty at that time though her behavior since and at present has now fully convinced me that she was there are a sort of women who from a shameful neglect in their education will too freely give and take improper liberties thinking it sufficient virtue to abstain from mere matter of fact i have seen women sometimes handle and present a pistol out of a bravo who would be terrified to death at the thoughts of letting it off i hoped the best and imagined she might be one of these though after all where is the difference between a wife who is really or only seemingly guilty if as the verse says she still is virtuous if she so is deemed the reverse of this maxim has i am sure much greater truth in it  in the next place the thoughts of my dear children came across my mind i believed them both my own and loved them with a true fathers fondness could i then think of exposing their mother the mother of my daughter more particularly to infamy for a mother in dishonor is a reproach to the children my own pride also came in bar on the apprehension that such misfortunes from the unreasonable and unaccountable opinions of the world generally occasion a man to fall into contempt  all these considerations joined together operated upon my mind and wrought my temper to that calm conduct which i manifested upon this mortifying occasion they governed my behavior toward her also for there is certainly no medium between seeming to think a wife guilty and turning her out of doors and it hurt my pride less to appear credulous than tame  chap cxxvii my wife did not by any means behave properly upon this crisis though possibly she meant to do so she was very illtempered and insolent perhaps from imagining that mildness and humility might argue a sense of guilt and rendered the poor old butler so uneasy in his service that he gave me warning in a week after this adventure which obliged me to discharge him and settle an annuity on him for life  thus matters went on a little aukwardly between us for about three weeks till the day before yesterday when i happened to go to dine at a neighbors in a free way without invitation or knowing who were to be of his company there i chanced most unluckily to meet the person who is the subject of our present tragedy we took no manner of notice of each other which however being in a mixed company was not observed the bottle went briskly about and i drank hard and in an ill temper which is always a dangerous thing  when we broke up and came to mount our horses this gentlemans servants were out of the way he was pressed to stay and answered that he was under an engagement to some company at his own house that night but lamented the want of one of his men whom he called his guide as he knew the road across the country and that it was now late and dark no matter for that replied our host follow your friend there said he pointing to me to his avenuegate it is not half a mile about and it is strange if you are not able to find the way from thence which you have been galloping to and fro both night and day for these twelve months past  this unlucky reflection increased my rancour i made no manner of reply to the proposition but mounting my horse bowed to the gentleman of the house and rode off this absurd person followed me i was piqued at it it appeared a fresh insult it was making too slight of my resentment i mended my pace to get rid of him but he pursued me still i had not the least thought of it the instant before i am convinced that this may have been often the case people should be particularly careful therefore never to indulge as we are too apt to do that malice or habit of mind which may temper them for a crime that opportunity or the devil may suddenly tempt them to  just when we came to a certain pass i turned into a field and pulling up my bridle cried out to him i have taken the lead from you long enough  i now resign it to you push away across this fair field and we shall recover the road again at the end of it he clapped spurs to his horse and in an instant i heard them both in full speed fall tumbling down the precipice i listened for a minute but heard neither motion or groan from man or beast i was struck with horror  i grew sober in a moment  i repented too late and through the awful silence and horrid darkness of the night rode home a wretch indeed  this sir concluded he is the entire truth and total circumstance of my unhappy story and to show you that i am not quite guilty i have been obliged to let you into the secret how far i am so not guilty perhaps according to the laws of man but too surely criminal to the full against those of god  chap cxxviii he then told me that the coroners inquest had brought in a verdict of accidental death the evening before as no marks of violence appeared upon either of the bodies but what had been occasioned by the fall thus you see sir said he upon what ground i stand with regard to any prosecution about this affair so that nothing but the confidence which your generous deportment with the kind hint you have dropped of extricating me out of this difficult business have tempted me to place in you need have induced me to let you into the secret of my being in any manner accessory to this murder which in all my future prayers and penitence i shall ever consider and endeavor to atone for as one in all its most horrid and culpable forms amen  he then claimed my promise about quashing the indictment i told him how i had reasoned and how far prevailed with the lady the evening before that upon what i had heard from both parties i could judge that there was now no possibility of their ever living together again and that i thought he would make a prudent bargain in giving her a bill of divorce with two hundred pounds a year to get quietly rid of this troublesome and unhappy affair he embraced me and the proposal together  i went down stairs to acquaint my fair client with this negotiation and she willingly accepted of the terms on condition that i should be her trustee i mentioned this article to the husband who very readily consented to it i see plainly said he her further scheme in this you are an handsome young fellow and she has no design i dare say of retiring into a nunnery she would keep up an intercourse with you be it so she has now the world before her where to choose and though it is some consolation to my humanity at the same time i think she has better fortune than she deserves to fall into the hands and protection of a gentleman of worth and honor he was pleased to add as you sir appear to be  immediately upon this i sent off an express to the next town for an attorney who came and while the gentleman and i were at breakfast drew up the article for a separate maintenance we then went into the room to the lady for their mutual signing and sealing which when over he rose from his seat made a low bow to her without saying a word but threw a bill of fifty pounds into her lap and let fall some tears then turning toward me thanked embraced me and retired  this moving scene affected me extremely it was near half an hour before i could get the better of it had i been twenty years older i i might possibly not have got rid of it so soon she appeared a good deal discomposed also she wiped away a few tears cried dear sir am i not extremely to be pitied but it is past it is over now and it is a jest to think of resisting destiny this is a fine salvo that some folks have got  they sin away without remorse and impute their crimes to fate  the stars are more in fault than they chap cxxix i then went up stairs to see how my fair prisoner had rested and found her just done breakfast she asked me where i had been truanting for the hour past and i replied that there had happened a small lawsuit in the neighborhood that i had been appointed umpire on both sides and had settled the dispute to the entire satisfaction of the parties ay said she with a sigh you can be good if you please i staid with her reading and talking to her by turns till her chicken came upon the table and then retired to my own meal as usual for the flavor of beef or mutton were yet too strong for her  i went down stairs paid a visit to my new ward and joined my dinner to hers our behavior toward each other was a good deal constrained she thought perhaps that a free carriage might have given me too slight an opinion of her character and i imagined that a cavalier air on my part would seem too much like taking advantage of her present situation we drank a bottle of wine together after dinner talked of indifferent matters and i then took my leave pretending some extraordinary business called me away for i had given a caution to the family not to acquaint her with my particular engagements in the house and she seemed a stranger to them herself at parting she invited me to return to supper which i promised  i drank tea and played picquet with my first charge till nine oclock and then retired i felt myself uneasy all the evening i was dissatisfied with the disingenuousness of my own conduct and was alarmed at my entering too far into vice i had virtue enough to condemn such courses but not resolution sufficient to quit them  after supper the fair refugee and i appeared a good deal more at our ease together we entered into a very galant converse made a jest of prudes and ridiculed parsons deemed matrimony but mere form and that the unlucky expression of man and wife becoming one flesh was apt from the very idea of homogeneity to make them consider each other too much as the legs or arms of the same body affording little more enjoyment in the conjugal embrace than if they were only hugging themselves observed that david was a man after gods own heart without troubling ourselves to fix the era when he became so preferred the canticles in the literal sense to all the rest of the bible and agreed that epicurus was the best of all moral philosophers  we drank two bottles together during this entertainment toward the close of which she began to grow full of sorrow and lamented her misfortunes  i became full of compassion and comforted her she seemed perfectly pleased with my company and wished frequently as she was so kind to express herself to be possessed of my sex sense and spirit they are all at your service madam said i  there is a nation in the world who think that by killing an enemy they shall be endowed with all his faculties and i would die to serve you no no replied she you are not my enemy and i think i could sooner kill myself than injure you the goodnatured creature  well then said i there is another way of compassing your flattering wish you have read the eastern tales i presume there is a story among them of a certain dervise who possessed the faculty of shooting his soul into any dead body he pleased and reanimating it again while his own lay a breathless coarse beside it this fable believe me madam is verified among us adepts at oxford nowadays and i myself have been thoroughly initiated into the mystery of transmigration take an example now said i go stretch yourself at full length upon that couch there in the very posture of a dead person and counterfeit a trance i will then instantly let fly my soul into you upon the wings of love and revive you again to the wonderful delight of all spectators while my inanimate body shall then lie panting by your side  it was now the season which midwives distinguish by the title of gandermonth a bill of divorce reduces it to simple fornication and the consent of an husband absolves even that crime however i did not venture to urge this last argument to her for fear of making her refractory three reasons must be very insufficient indeed if they cannot furnish out an excuse among them   an artichoke and a pineapple have the same shape but what a difference in the flavor  the next morning she hired a postchaise and drove off to london  chap cxxx here is a rake for you ladies with a witness yea verily with two two strings to his bow in faith but to speak seriously now prithee whose fault is it his or yours the affair with the manlady do you mind was none of his seeking i am sure he happened to meet with it where no man living would have gone to look for it he was searching for a wound only when this same hiatus valde ridendus presented itself to his view obstupuit steteruntque etc and as falstaff says rebellion lay in his way and he stumbled upon it  if women will come into young fellows bedchambers and then fall into fainting fits there what in nature can a man do but like a quack apply the panacea to them his laboratory has no other drops no other hartshorn no other cordial but this  and as for this here gentlewoman neither did he seek her either did he stir across the threshold of the door to meet her did she not come to the very house dragooning him might he not use the se defendendo plea i think it is all fair after a man has first tried what effect an exhortation may produce could the parson of the parish himself have done more and you must acknowledge that mr carewe did preach a most excellent sermon to her though how he came by so many texts of scripture without having been bred at glasgow i cannot conceive and in the course of his homily too he gives a prudent hint to all galants with regard to cuckolds foenum habet in cornu he says   a word more with regard to what the husband says about the nod of chastity which may be styled the nod of assent or critical minute i am to inform you that the french phrase for this same expression is lheure de berger or the shepherds hour now if the character of a nation as is reasonably enough affirmed may be known from its proverbs i must congratulate my fair countrywoman in having the advantage in point of chastity over their neighbors even in the great proportion of sixty to one this frail crisis holds only a minute with english women but lasts a full hour with french females  chap cxxxi when i found that my fair academie was perfectly recovered i began to renew my galantries toward her again one night after we had supped and parted as usual i returned back from my apartment with my nightcap in my pocket and went into her bedchamber i found her on her knees and earnest at prayer i was confounded and retired into the antechamber where i stood musing till i heard her begin to move but before i could gain the door she had shot the bolt on the inside and walked away to the farther end of the room i became sensible of a certain inward rebuke upon this occasion and immediately returned up stairs to my own chamber  the next morning we met at breakfast during which we appeared under a mutual constraint and aukwardness toward each other after the teatable was removed i attempted to open the conversation upon the last nights incident but faltered in the first sentence upon which she interrupted me thus  never never mr carewe must we meet again on any other terms but those of friendship a woman may be betrayed into error by anothers crime but it must be her own vice that suffers her to continue in it i have had by this time sufficient leisure for reflection and have passed severe ones on my former conduct but i rejoice in the smart which heals whilst it corrodes good god cried she out in a passion of tears was it not enough that i should sink at once from man to woman but that i must again fall even below the only character estimable in her too  she was going on but i interrupted her by catching her in my arms in a sudden transport of generosity and fondness and offering to marry her that very instant no she replied and wresting herself from my embrace you have once denied me that happiness already  it is enough  i will not accept it now for i shall never receive from your honor what i cannot owe to your love had you ever loved before i might perhaps be led to accept of the present cool terms you offer that dangerous crisis once over i might possibly be induced to compound for your friendship and esteem but while i have that hazardous era to dread i must always keep a reserve over my own affections toward you which would be inconsistent with that union which your generosity alone has challenged you now to proffer this reflection will be explained in chapter cxxxix   ever since that fatal day  or rather happy one as i may now deem it continued she when you revealed to me the unfortunate situation i was in my thoughts have constantly turned inward on myself the spring of that religious and virtuous education with which my dear mother had imbued my mind reverberated then so strongly on my heart that it quickly awakened every pious sense which avocation idleness and pleasure had till then lulled to sleep  i meditated on the dependency of our earthly state on the relation duty and obedience we owe to our creator i weighed well the worth of all worldly enjoyments and upon comparing time with eternity have fixed my soul so firmly upon higher concerns that my mind has at length happily arrived to this just reflection that nothing here below but innocence peace and ease are worth my care  i will tomorrow continued she reassume my former disguise and still carry on the masquerade both on account of my dear mothers commands and for one of the reasons she gave too namely that it will save me from the irksomeness and danger of any farther solicitation or attempt which by that means i should have escaped from you also if so unforeseen and unprovided an accident had not unfortunately thrown me too much into your power  she spoke all this with a collected spirit and stoicism which astonished and charmed me it raised my esteem for her to the highest pitch but at the same time affected me with such a tenderness and contrition that i could not possibly refrain from tears which she perceiving called out to me in a manly tone and with a smile at the same time what mr carewe said she are you going to change your sex also for shame added she shake off this womanish weakness  arouse and be a man these were the very words he made use of to her when he was spiriting her up to the duel chapter cii paragrath  th latter part of it i recovered myself but made no reply  this whole day we spent together in a general converse through which i behaved myself with the highest politeness and decorum both in my deportment toward her and in avoiding the most oblique hint which might revive in her mind the remembrance of our former connection this charming woman seemed much flattered with the respect and delicacy of my manners she declared that she sincerely esteemed this day to be the happiest and most pleasant we had ever spent together and i endeavored to think so  the next morning she hired a postchaise to carry her to her grandfathers where she told me she designed to stay during the remainder of the vacation and then return to the university to finish her studies she dressed herself en cavalier and wrapped herself up in a roclaure pretending to be afraid of catching cold on her journey so soon after her lying in she made a present of all her femalities to the daughter of the house saying to me in a low voice farewell now for life to my poor helpless sex then committing the care of our son and nurse to our host and hostess we tenderly embraced and she hurried into the chaise with a precipitation which betrayed her not to be yet quite mistress of her philosophy  i remained for some time at the gate looking after the carriage while it continued in view and contemplating upon this virtuous and extraordinary woman i then returned into the house discharged my bills embraced my hermes took posthorses and rode back to college not so pleasantly indeed but much more composed in mind however than when i left it  chap cxxxii i passed a very uneasy time of it there for a week i felt an awkward want of half myself and if not the most necessary at least the pleasantest part of me i was dull in company and melancholic when alone i began to suspect i loved her but this i was sure of that had she given me time enough for it i should certainly have done so  at one while i was for carrying her off and ravishing her into matrimony nor was this generous thought at all checked by reflecting on her large fortune for that article i was firmly resolved to have made easy to myself i scorned to accept the portion of fraud and would have restored it to the rightful heir  at another time i had one curiosity already gratified and another still to satisfy namely to try how long a spliced chastity could hold out and whether this experiment might not be like new wine put into old bottles or a new piece into an old garment at length time and use which generally blend all our wants and losses with the common complexion of life restored my carelessness and spirits to me again  on the commencement of our term my dear levis agyeu one of the names of apollo from his having no beard returned to college as soon as i heard of her arrival i went to wait on her at her apartments  she received me with great civility and affection but immediately putting on her hat said it was a fine morning and desired the pleasure of my company to take a walk with her in the park as she wanted a little private conversation with me which might be interrupted by other visitants i approved of but was dissatisfied at this caution of hers  when we were alone in the park she told me that the old colonel seemed extremely rejoiced at her visit but much concerned at seeing her look so pale and thin you have studied your eyes out my child said he and it is high time to be done with that same work now you have been chewing upon three years of crabbed learning already at that same university as it is called besides all you swallowed before at school and if you are not as wise as solomon by this time the devils in it for me but there is an end of all farther puzzling now as i have lately procured a cornetcy for you from my old friend the secretary of war and i long sadly to see you strut the parade in your military uniform shortly  you know said she to me that i am no amazon and yet this declaration of his did not distress me so much as you might naturally expect  i was prepared for it from his frequent resolutions in that way and had therefore furnished myself with an answer i returned him thanks for this and all his other kind intentions in my favor but added that with regard to the professions of life it was always both prudent and reasonable to grant the party engaging some liberty of choice in a matter of so much moment both to themselves and others  zounds said he thou is not afraid is thee no sir i replied with an assured countenance i thank god that i fear nothing now but himself and you but it is my duty to the first of these most sacred obligations continued i which makes me hesitate about too implicit an obedience to your commands very fine very fine replied the colonel all this begins very finely indeed but tell me quickly now without any more of your logic or sophistry what the devil is all this about  chap cxxxiii i thus went on when i entered upon the study of natural philosophy sir at the university i was charmed and surprised at the internal art and contrivance of the almighty artificer in many subjects which i had looked upon superficially before still as i proceeded still as my knowledge improved in mathematics gravitation attraction and astronomy my mind enlarged and my soul was impressed with a sense of awe and wonder at the amazing greatness goodness and economy of providence nor needs all this to refute the fool of david the fool has said in his heart there is no god  show him but a straw and when he has accounted for that let him then dispute a deity  afterward sir when i had entered into my course of moral philosophy i quick perceived the duties the relations the dependencies both of civil and religious obligations i almost thought the system perfect but there seemed still to be something yet wanting i loved virtue but feared not vice i adored the deity but feared impiety in prayer i asked for blessings and yet dreaded them as curses there needed two things yet absolutely necessary to complete the scheme certain sanctions for our virtue and a revelation to instruct our worship  these great desiderata then directed my inquiries toward religion i here found all was perfect harmony the scene extended my views enlarged the concordance between divine and human things apparent virtue encouraged and vice deterred and to sum up all a form of worship appointed which abolished idolatry instructed prayer and restrained enthusiasm  what the devil is all this for interrupted the old soldier was this harangue necessary said he to let us know you were a christian i always honored religion as much as you or any scholar of oxford or cambridge either ay by g  as much as the chaplain of our regiment himself who by the lord was as honest and jolly a fellow as any of the corpse but a man may serve god and his king and country too at the same time i hope grant me but that and there is an end of the argument  you are certainly in the right of it sir replied i and your observation is indeed very just but then sir in return i hope that you will allow me there may be more ways than one of doing all three how in the name of god now is that possible answered he can we preserve the protestant religion hanover or old england any other way but by fighting  dear sir said i i am far from disputing the necessity of fighting for as the world is at present constituted there must be soldiers as well as other handicraftmen but pray sir is not a divine instructing his congregation or reforming his parish more serviceable to god the king and his country than a colonel of horse or foot exercising his regiment on the parade  is not the making of good subjects more necessary than the training of soldiers one may be hired the other not  what so fitted to make men brave as religion and what to regulate the discipline of an army as morals the divine then is necessary in the first instance  the soldier only in the second the soldiers profession is but temporal and temporary the divines celestial and eternal  preach me no preachments interrupted old mars a parson indeed were he such as i am afraid few parsons are might perhaps do some service to religion and his country in the way you suppose but never tell me man that all the preaching in the world can ever be able to defend hanover no no bilbo is the word there and right or wrong nolus volus we must all fight for hanover that is a sure thing  i replied there was no fear but there would be always people enough found to fight for hanover or a castle in the air if they were paid for it but as all men were not to be soldiers we might be left at liberty to choose our professions and that for my own part i had for some time been sensible of so strong a propensity toward putting on the gown that i took it to be an inward call from the spirit to enter into holy orders  call me no calls replied old testy you are a coward sirrah i see you are you are no man but an hodmandod a shellsnail  and would rather fight the devil than a frenchman call of the spirit no sneaker it is want of spirit that is your call and like a criminal flying for his life you would take sanctuary in a church would you yours is no call i say it is proffered service and you know the proverb you sh  n a  e fellow you  call of the spirit forsooth but it is necessary that some people should pretend it or how few of the pulpits in england would be filled nowadays how many do i know myself who were never called by the spirit nor ever call upon it either but business must be done and they marry and christen as well as the best for a parsons a parson and there is an end on it what the devil need we desire more  but here is another difficulty continued he you have brought upon me too by your strange notions of spirit and pulpit and such tringumtrangums  what will your quaking spirit help me to do now with the commission that i have laid out all my interest to procure for you and which i must now return so thanklessly upon my friends hands again by no means sir said i you may dispose of it more properly than even by giving it to me  my cousin tom sir will readily accept of it it will be looked upon as a kind of present to him and i would willingly obviate every occasion of jealousy which might possibly arise between us  and so by g  d i will replied he sharply and if i should leave him my estate too what would you say to that youth i should say nothing sir but should think that as you have made the fortune by your own valor you have certainly a right to bestow it according to your own favor and if sir added i your opinion or inclinations should point him out as the more worthy object i shall be perfectly resigned both to the dispensations of providence and yours  pugh pugh said he you will not let me have my own way in any thing i see  i am not used to these oldfangled notions and i dont know for the blood of me how to deal with them i wish with all my soul that either you or i were different sort of people that we might understand one another rightly but let us have done with it now child said he and go bid them lay the cloth for supper  chap cxxxiv you may be surprised perhaps said she at the easiness with which i seem to have resigned a fortune in which might be comprehended all the flattering prospects and enjoyments of life but mr carewe pursued she with a sigh i had already shaken hands with this life and though i think i have now happily attained to such a pitch of firmness and fortitude of mind that were it possible to be either my duty or obligation to fight i could this instant draw the sword and like another joan d arc rush into the midmost battle but to enter a volunteer in arms would have been a presumption unbecoming my real character and therefore i declined it  and as to the worldly considerations which might naturally have perplexed me upon this occasion continued she i had already wrought my mind to this determination about them i do not think that female virtue consists in chastity alone though certainly both prudence and decency require this to be our distinguishing character this duty we owe first to religion and next to ourselves but justice is an higher point of virtue because we owe this both to god to ourselves to our neighbor and to the rights of civil society  i had hitherto carried on the deceit in obedience to my mothers commands  but ever since i began to consider things in an higher light and to compare my first and second duty together i had resolved to act in this matter that equitable and ingenuous part which i am certain she would herself direct were she now to return upon earth to instruct me  what then had i to apprehend from my grandfathers resentment but that event which i had before resolved upon in my own mind the virtue of the act was already perfect in resolve and the merit of the gift i was willing to resign to another i could not imagine that my grandfather would have cast me off to absolute beggary and any reasonable provision he might have made for me would have served to support me in that scheme of life which i had already resolved upon for i am determined said she to put on the gown for one additional reason more than my dear mother gave me for wearing a male habit which is that a respect to my profession may restrain both that profane and immodest manner of speaking before me which i have already sustained too much of among men  i was charmed said mr carewe at the nobleness of soul in this virtuous woman but was somewhat mortified however to find that i was not capable myself of the same refinement of sentiment in one particular for i confess that i felt disappointed at her having prevented me from recommending to her the very action she had already resolved upon and from offering her three hundred pounds a year out of my own fortune in consideration of her resigning the estate to her cousin which i assure ye gentlemen said he had for some time past been fully my purpose  i was going once to mention this to her but thought it might have had a disingenuous air and in short said he i was really as much puzzled as old square toes himself to know how to deal with her oldfangled notions as he styled them and almost wished as he did that either of us were different sort of people  however this not sincerely for i thought it too soon for myself to quit the pursuit of pleasure and indeed for her too as the small snack she had got of it was hardly in my opinion worth so much repentance but as grace comes earlier to some people than to others i would not wish to disturb her peace or attempt to interrupt her course of virtue but for a moment to gratify even my warmest desires for i was resolved upon all occasions of this kind to qualify as much as possible the sinner with the saint and never to mix up a greater potion of vice with my pleasure than was just necessary as a vehicle to it by which means i ever retained an hank in hand as the jockeys phrase it to pull up before i was got to the brink of the precipice  chap cxxxv while i was revolving these things in my mind the fair prolocutor thus went on the next morning said she after breakfast the old gentleman called me into his apartment and after some minutes silence during which time he sat musing and looking at the fire he lifted up his head and turning his face toward me in a goodhumoured tone of voice mr parson said he i could not well sleep last night for the sermon you preached to me yesterday evening  it put me in mind of your poor mother she was a great reasoner and would sometimes argufy the case with me till she used to put me into a passion for i always hated womens prate but it does well enough in a man especially a scholar as you are for what does people learn for do you see me if they dont show it therefore i consent do you mind that you make yourself a parson as soon as you will and though i must say that you have disappointed me hugely in my first design for you i dont doubt in the least but you may be a good man yet for all that and we will now be as good friends as ever said he and shaking me by the hand at the same time  i thanked him on my bended knee but he ordered me to rise quickly saying never kneel child but to the king god bless him or your prayers  that is my notion son and i dont doubt but i shall see you chaplain to our regiment yet and you shall be so believe me added he if strong drink can kill a parson and that i have any interest with some people and i never say a thing that i dont mean to do that is my way do you mark me  you will live a roving jolly life of it then you dog you and know more of the world in one year there than you would do in seven in this parish or the next but i have sent for your cousin tommy and will give him the commission you know no  you shall give it to him yourself it shall be your gift it will make him love you and i would have families live well together child after i am dead and rotten  he then gave me the secretary of wars letter which mentioned that he had procured a cornetcy for him at his request in the  regiment of cavalry and desired him to write the persons name at the bottom of that letter and return it to him immediately in order to have the commission filled up i thanked him for the pleasing office he had assigned me  for giving is certainly one of the pleasantest things in the world  in the evening my cousin arrived equipt perfectly a la militaire for my aunt in compliment to the martial enthusiasm of her father had ever since he was put into breeches affected to have him dressed like an officer with cockade sword and gambadoes he is perfect master of his exercises which with a little smattering of french is the only part of education his parents had ever attended to he has an handsome genteel person and has that kind of forwardness and air of confidence which persons who know one thing a little and are quite ignorant of every thing else are apt to assume he had lately challenged a young apothecary in the town where his father lived for saying that it was ridiculous to see a chit pretend to strut about with a sword on who was only of fit size to wear a glysterbag armed and the pistol and the pestle were going to it ding dong when some friends happened to interpose and put an end to this martial strife  after the mutual salutes were over i took him aside into another parlour and showed him the letter from the secretary of war he congratulated me upon my good fortune but said with a sigh that he would rather be in possession of that commission than of the old dons estate for that the army was the only profession for a gentleman all the rest of the world being divided into paysans and bourgeois and that he longed most bloodily to be at slashing work with the french  then cousin said i you seem to be a much fitter person for this business than i am for upon my word i bear no manner of malice to any people breathing not even to my foes so saying i carelessly took up a pen which lay on the table and writing down thomas irwin at the foot of the letter presented it to him  he kissed it hugged me and drawing his sword made several passes at an old windsor chair swearing that there should not be a frenchman in the world by the end of the campaign and that he would then gather all the women together into a seraglio and people the kingdom over again himself with good protestants  come along my gallant soldier said i and pay your acknowledgments where they are more properly due for the gift is our grandfathers though he was so kind as to appoint me the giver we then went up stairs to the old gentlemans room where the brisk cornet returned him hasty thanks for his preferment and instantly begged leave to set out that evening for london to deliver the letter and expedite the commission the good old man cried there is a lad for you that is in haste to fight then gave him his blessing with a bill of an hundred pounds and dismissed him  chap cxxxvi here we were interrupted by the coming up of three or four of our college acquaintance with whom we walked a few turns till the bell struck three oclock i then pressed her to come home and dine with me which she refused upon which i offered to go home with her that she might be at liberty to finish the rest of her story if any yet remained but she replied that she had nothing prepared at her chambers and proposed to the rest of the company that we should all go to the tavern together which was agreed upon  after dinner we entered into a lively conversation in which she bore her part with great wit and spirit and seemed to be more cheerful and disingaged in her manner than i had known her for many months past this struck me as a confirmation of her virtue the conflict seemed to be over my heart exulted with joy  we drank our friends in the usual course and then one of the company who had been appointed magister bibendi proposed a round of sentiments and began himself decently enough with the joys of friendship love and wine the next turn fell to me and i gave the season of may and the age of fifteen but this sort of chaste archness did not long continue for the next person called upon launched out beyond all innuendo which began to give my delicate friend some uneasiness she cast a look of distress toward me and i immediately put a stop to the round by acquainting the company that our friend there had lately taken the resolution of going into orders and that such ribaldry must certainly be offensive to him she bowed and the rest were silent  i then proposed as we were all scholars that we should toast some classical rounds of memories beginning with the philosophers while we were sober and reserving the poets for our more jovial cups the fancy took because the thought was new and each person declared his sect by his toast plato led the way because he wore good clothes and kept a good table democritus came next because he was a merry fellow and taught long before copernicus that the world turned round then followed zeno not on account of the severity of his philosophy but because he had done justice on himself for it by an halter  when it came to my turn i named aristippus on account of the character that horace gives of him omnis aristippum decuit color and status and res then my fair philosopher concluded the round with socrates as being in the opinion of erasmus a christian before christianity and then immediately rose up and quitted the company i offered to attend her home but she forbad it saying that she had her lectures to look over before examinations and appointed me to meet her the next morning in the park as before to conclude her story i returned to my company and finished the evening a la mode  chap cxxxvii the next day i met my charming friend said he at the time and place appointed and after a quarter of an hours conversation upon general topics she proceeded with the thread of her narration thus far said she had i tolerably well extricated myself from a very difficult piece of business but my principal point had not been yet obtained there was a matter of much higher consequence still to be disposed of which i confess i was so impatient to have adjusted that i was one or twice very near declaring the whole secret of my disguise to my grandfather had not a tenderness for my mothers character prevented me  i then determined with myself to keep the matter still a secret thinking that no accident could disappoint the honest purpose i had already framed for should i happen to die before my grandfather the estate would devolve of course into the right line and should i outlive him i might then resign it with equal advantage to my cousin as at present  however some scruples arose that justice delayed was in some sort justice denied and that it was always prudent to be honest while one may lest the general frailty of human nature might perhaps obstruct the fair intent when the time may call upon us to perfect it by action besides said she the matter lay a dead weight upon my mind and i was impatient to get rid of it in order to dedicate my whole soul to the contemplation and enjoyment of philosophy and religion  upon this resolve i went up directly into my grandfathers chamber who was much confined by the gout i took occasion to commend the spirit and accomplishments of my cousin in which he seemed heartily to join me with a certain martial joy in his countenance at the same time i added that i imagined he must have been just such a brisk young fellow himself at his years all fire and activity the very counterpart exactly replied he with a smile of satisfaction i am extremely sorry then sir said i that you have not such an heir to represent you who might serve to perpetuate your fame and keep your character alive after you are gone better than i can possibly do in my confined scheme of life who am likely to hide both under a gown and bury their memory in some country cure  what do mean boy replied he with a good deal of surprise have not i told you already that we are as good friends now as ever prithee what sort of a crotchet have got in thy noddle at present lad pray explain it quickly now without more ifs or ands to which i replied that i was then come to justify my character to him by giving a convincing proof of the sincerity with which i had made my option of the gown in preference to the sword by begging leave to renounce all future pretensions to his favor with regard to the estate that as i did really mean to sequester myself entirely from the world firmly resolving never to marry so great a fortune might be either a temptation or an encumbrance to me for that fortune titles rank and grandeur are dangerous sophisters and too often persuade us that the false goods of life are the true ones that his other grandson was more likely to wear it with honor and being capable of bustling in camps and shining in courts and senates was a fitter person to put foremost in the world at the head of a family which his own virtue and bravery had so lately brought into respect and notice that for my part i should perfectly acquiesce in whatever portion his kindness might think proper to allot me which though ever so small said i if i have virtue will be as much as i shall want and if not will be more than i shall deserve  the good old man continued she at these words burst into tears saying at the same time in an hurrying manner boy boy you were born to be my plague and are still crossing me in every scheme i have but perceiving that my tears fell faster than his own he cried prithee be quiet child and dont distress me any farther  dont be angry i dont mean what i say to vex you all i meant was  but indeed i dont know what to mean or say you have made such a fool of me we continued both silent for several minutes before we could either of us compose ourselves sufficiently to speak any farther upon the subject  we then entered into several expostulations on both sides but upon finding me determined in my purpose he at length acquiesced in my proposal and asked me upon what provision i had formed my economy speak said he and be it what it will you shall have it by g  i declined this offer saying that it would not be becoming in me to parcel out his bounty nor to stipulate conditions as if i was selling the estate only thus far i might pretend to prescribe that i should prefer a sum of money to an annuity in order to have something in my power to leave to friendship or to charity  well then my dear child said he i gave your sister three thousand pounds do you mind and i will give you four if that will content you but hearky me cried the worthy soldier at the same time dont be mealymouthed about the matter in the least for you shall have what you please as i told you before i said twas ample bowed and thanked him  the next morning continued she he sent for me into his chamber and showed me the draught of the present will he designed to perfect by which he had made the provision of four thousand pounds in my favor and settled his estate on my cousin but with a remainder over to me in case he should not leave any heirs male behind him  for you deserve it said he if i had ten estates by the lord you deserve them all  i expressed a proper sense of gratitude upon this occasion staid with him till he could hobble about the house received his blessing and came off hither to finish my studies said she and to take upon me the profession of holy orders which i have already declared to you  chap cxxxviii during the course of her story i was affected and amazed i dropped tears at some parts of it and would have praised her in others but that there appeared a nobleness and a spirit in her virtue which seemed above it and awed me into silence i found myself in a situation too difficult to be described your own sentiment and delicacy gentlemen said he must represent it to you i could not admire without lamenting nor commend her without condemning myself  however there was one part of her discourse which had dwelt upon my mind ever since the first proposition of it and which i then laid hold of to extricate my speech i was displeased at her purpose of going into orders she was perfect enough intrinsically and needed not the cloak of sanctity and cleric pride joined to female vanity methought would be enough to demolish the purest saint that ever was canonized i therefore took occasion from this subject to open my mouth and gave her the following opinion upon it  i told her that there was something very unorthodox in her scheme women are ordered to keep silence in the churches so that the business of catechizing preaching or exhorting can never become any part of their province that were there even no offense in the thing itself yet the disingenuousness of the act was unworthy of her that the carrying on a deceit at the foot of the altar even with the best intent was dangerous hypocrisy nor was such a pious fraud at all necessary to her purpose as we may dedicate our services to heaven under any character or in any profession and that the world is at present so constituted that the precept or example of one virtuous layman would have more effect than the preaching of ten parsons  i added that should she even be able to preserve the secret during her life her death at last most certainly would reveal it that the story of pope joan was a disgrace even to that religion that was before a disgrace to itself and that this discovery might supply small wits and libertines with matter of scoff would bring a reflection upon her memory and occasion her body to be the object of public view i will set thee as a gazingstock i will show the nations thy nakedness and the kingdoms thy shame nahum  she assured me that she had never considered the matter in any of these lights before that knowing of no salique law in scripture to exclude women from the ministry nor in france to exclude them from the throne neither though it was construed and strained to that sense by philip de valois in order to exclude edward the iiid of england from the crown  she had presumed that nothing but negative custom merely which establishes no law stood against it but that what i had just hinted to her had struck her in such a way as to make her suspect that she had used somewhat of that kind of ingenious sophistry with herself which she had already condemned in her dear mother but that at present she found both her scruples and delicacy sufficiently alarmed to resolve on laying aside her purpose she then thanked me for my advice and concluded her speech by saying that she was pleased to owe me any thing  i snatched her hand with eagerness crying out my charming saint it is impossible that you should ever be indebted to him whose life and fortunes you have already so fully purchased the pittance you have compounded for with your grandfather is too scanty a provision for you for life  take half my estate in addition  i here most  hold mr carewe interrupted she  keep your fortune but amend your life this would be true generosity to me indeed and this the only present be assured i shall ever accept of from your hands  however said she seeing me affected and confounded let us still continue friends for life i find a perfect disposition in myself toward this chaste connection and i should hope that your heart however libertine it may be is not totally devoid of all platonics neither some company appeared in sight and came strolling up to us just as she had finished this expression and she retired home immediately afterward  yes my cherub said i to myself and gazing after her my friendship my admiration my esteem can never possibly be raised higher toward any mortal object then why o nature have thou suffered love to be a passion distinct from these i would this moment sacrifice my life for thy service and yield my fortune in exchange for love but twill not be  my fated hour is not yet arrived and chance not choice must fix my destiny  chap cxxxix this reflection of mr carewe is both natural and mortifying at the same time how must it hurt ones moral not to be able to raise or direct our passion toward an object whom reason honor virtue and obligation even with the addition of youth and beauty may point out to us as in this and frequent other instances has been the case  and on the other hand how must it pique our pride to be reduced to wear the chains of some idiot of an harlot or what is infinitely worse a shrew even with beauty and youth but often without either of which i could quote you many examples  a friend of mine who though a man of both sense and spirit had labored for some years under this predicament after many fruitless struggles to set himself free compared himself aptly enough to a lion in heraldry held fast by the lower parts and pawing to get loose  distinct from that charming and rational union of hearts and minds which is the general sympathy of the most perfect natures there arises sometimes a certain extraordinary and unaccountable fever in the blood more a phrenzy than a passion and rather an instinct than a sentiment which it is said people are at one time or another of their lives afflicted with  most people are born with the seeds of this passion as well as of the smallpox in their constitution which sooner or later break out as the blood or humors of the body happen to be apt or fit to nourish the distemper these two unavoidable incidents are so much alike in several particulars that i shall carry on the allusion the better to illustrate my subject  one is a disorder in the blood and the other an impression on the mind from the first of which no temperance or art in physic and from the latter not the best sense or most exercised philosophy are able to defend us  i style this sort of love an impression on the mind to distinguish it from all sentimental passion or any principle in human nature  excluding all manner of desire admiration or esteem inspired by youth beauty or merit  as these may be fairly accounted for from physical or moral reasons and may consequently become effects as often as these causes shall operate  but the love i mean is a mad enthusiasm of the soul a singular caprice of the affections that sometimes makes us dote on what at another time we should fear to look on it is a fancy that passes beauty alba ligustra cadunt vaccinia nigra leguntur it is a sense which is enamoured of folly a sight that blinds us a thraldom we rejoice in a plague which we solicit  in fine a fascination a crisis or anomalous effect which like the operations of witchcraft proceeds unaccountably without any apparent cause deducible either from reason or nature  so by a calenture misled the mariner with rapture sees on the smooth oceans azure bed enamelled fields and verdant trees with eager haste he longs to rove in that fantastic scene and thinks it must be some enchanted grove and in he leaps and down he sinks we often escape both infections where one might naturally have apprehended the greatest danger and catch them perhaps at a time when we may have the least reason to imagine any probability of our being affected we are often struck at first sight and sometimes by the most unamiable objects  so that i have known persons to catch one as well as the other from a shock  when people fancy that they have been more than once affected by this disorder it must be by mistaking something else for it as the meazles often may impose itself upon the patient for the smallpox  there is one lucky circumstance then in which they both agree  that we are never attacked by either more than once in our lives  but alas how slight our triumph when effects sometimes remain for life almost as miserable as the malady such another victory as a certain general said would undo me  in love the struggling for an heart is like wrestling for an egg where though you gain the prize you get it broken  chap cxl this term completed my college course and my guardian acquainted me that he had entered my name in the temple books the night before i was to leave the university i gave a parting supper to my select friends among whom i had principally invited my fair stoic but she excused herself by a billet in which were only these words tender adieus are apt to leave impressions  it is easier to fly than struggle farewell  soon after i had gone to the temple i became of age and settled accounts with my trustees the balance in my favor was but about five thousand pounds the rest of my income having been expended upon my maintenance and education and the discharging of some encumbrances which had affected my estate  as soon as i received this money i was resolved that he first act of my manhood should be a deed of justice and honor i therefore immediately laid cut four thousand pounds in the funds and enclosed the debentures to my generous friend at oxford with only these words in the cover for hermes carewe  chap cxli i was now entered upon a more enlarged scene of life and action had an unrestrained dominion over my own fortune and was not accountable either for my diligence or idleness to any one but myself  the worst of all masters let people boast of liberty as much as they please my studies were quite of a different nature from any thing i had been used to read before it was beginning school again i would recommend coke upon lyttleton to be always taught immediately after grammar while the memory is strong and before the mind may have imbibed the least tincture of taste or polite erudition for as the study of it is a work of labor not of genius it comes to great disadvantage after virgil homer cicero or demosthenes  however i tugged away at this oar for some time till the world began to get hold of me i had more presumption than knowledge and greater spirit than judgment which naturally led me into two fatal errors at once i imagined that my understanding required no farther improvement and that a thousand pounds a year needed no economy i was naturally full of fire  but for want of fuel to maintain the flame i spent myself in a blaze  ut quondam in stipula magnus sine viribus ignis i set up an equipage and kept a pack of hounds about ten miles from london i hired a genteel valet de chamber out of livery i employed the most fashionable tailor and left the rates of every thing to himself i struck myself out of commons lived in taverns and  rented private lodgings near the temple  i learned more of life at this school of the world in six months than i had known at oxford in the five years that i was stationed there for though we had treble the number of students at the university yet they were not enough their own masters to exhibit that infinite variety of characters with which mankind abound if you see one frenchman one spaniard one italian you are furnished with specimens of their several nations but you may be acquainted with an hundred englishmen without knowing the english  it would be an endless task to enumerate or describe all the various characters i met with in this microcosm some of which indeed exceeded to such extravagance that they might more properly be styled caracaturas of mankind while others were so very anomalous to human nature that you would imagine i was describing the tenants of some other planet instead of our own species  this diversity was more apparent among the templars than in any other set of men in england because they live more upon an equality together and are less restrained by the decorums of mixed societies where different professions different ranks and different sexes join so that every man in his humor may be justly styled the temple comedy to which may be added one very unhappy cause also which is that they are in general tied down by no certain mode or system of religion theirs being mere philosophic deism alone  a consequential ill which freedom draws a bad effect though from a noble cause and here gentlemen said mr carewe as i have spent some years in this society i think proper to justify myself from certain suspicions which may possibly have arisen in your minds upon this occasion and i will now give you a sincere and ingenuous confession of my faith with regard to this most dread and interesting article and which i shall attempt to explain upon the simple dictates of reason alone without the discussing of mysterious systems or venturing into the inextricable labyrinths of polemic divinity  chap cxlii mr carewes confession of faith in the first place i take it for granted that whatever there may have been in profession and practice there never was a real atheist in belief some omnipotent omniscient monad some cause of causes light of light there must have been before all worlds necessarily independently and selfexisting coeval with eternity  in the next place i believe that this intelligence did by some supernatural conviction independent on reason or philosophy manifest or reveal itself to the first race of mankind i draw my argument from the number of erroneous absurd and unnatural systems of religions and beliefs which have appeared in the world from the most early ages of record  for had religion its rise from the pretense of legislators or been the result of mere philosophy the scheme of it would have been contrived more consonant to human reason like that of the turks which is consistent enough in its doctrines though erroneous in its faith but the purest revelation from heaven handed down by tradition and interpreted by priests must necessarily have involved both our belief and worship in all the impiety and blasphemy of the heathen rites and pagan superstitions  the greatest philosophers with socrates at their head finding the world in so forlorn a state cried out to heaven for a new revelation to dispel the mists of ignorance and reduce our wanderings into the right line it was reasonable to hope for such a guide from the goodness and justice of our creator and from our knowledge and experience of the ways of providence i firmly believe that whatever is best to do it always does perform  i think that the christian religion has at length supplied this great desideratum by conveying to us the most perfect moral and the purest worship that ever yet was proposed to man if we remain still in error it is surely the safest one we can possibly fall into for the proofs both internal and external are so consistently framed that the whole wit and philosophy of mankind cannot defend from the illusion we err with saints we err with wisdom we err with virtue we err with piety we err with infidelity converted and testifying its conviction through the martyrdom of death and tortures heaven must then either reward our faith with glory accept the will in atonement for the deed or pardon with impunity that error which itself has suffered to be with so much plausibility imposed upon us  i consider then a deist who writes or argues upon the religion of nature alone as he cannot possibly be an infidel to christianity upon conviction to be an immoral man and a dangerous citizen of the world we have alas too frequent and sad experience of the strongest sanctions of rewards and punishments being too weak for the lusts and passions of men and whoever would attempt to set us still more at liberty from the restraints of virtue must probably have conceived some mistaken interest in the indulgences of their own vice or in the tempting of others to the same fatal latitude  in fine without ever entering into a religious argument upon the subject we may venture to pronounce a professed atheist or deist to be either fool or knave because they but discourage the good and set the bad more at liberty  fear first made gods the impious atheist cries and fear unmade them the divine replies an atheist is certainly the most credulous fool breathing he believes contrary to all philosophy that matter produced motion first and that then they both laid their heads together and created intelligence  we cannot conceive thought to be immaterial say some philosophers but can they conceive matter to be intelligent we are conscious of our own ideas therefore we have undoubtedly a conception of somewhat distinct from matter  it is much more philosophic to imagine with berkley an universe of spirit than with hobbes an universe of matter for it is certainly more rational to think that spirit might create or according to berkleys metaphysical refinement impress the idea of matter than to suppose that mere matter could ever rouse itself to thought or action  chap cxliii i did not think it proper or decent to interrupt mr carewe while he was at confession for though i sometimes pretend to be jocular give me leave to assure the reader that the greatest heathen of greece or rome never had an higher respect for virtue nor the dullest parson in a country cure a more steadfast faith in the christian religion than the person who here assumes the title of biographer triglyph  this being premised and finding that mr carewe does not choose to treat you with a description of any of the characters he hints at as it would lead him into some satirical strictures which are by no means his turn of wit i shall here entertain you with one story out of his budget which is a most extraordinary and certain matter of fact already known to many of my london readers  the story of the weeping cull one of mr carewes friends was a man of remarkable good sense and agreeable manners but of a very grave deportment and a serious air which however did not appear to be natural to him as he had a lively eye an healthful state of body a florid complexion and seemed to be fond of company  he had been a resident there for three years beyond the terms requisite to be called to the bar and could not be deemed a student in any sense at this time for he neither read law divinity humanity or prophanity he used to spend most of his mornings in riding or walking and his evenings in the society of a few friends he was a sober man of good morals and a constant churchman twice a day  once a week on every thursday he kept a fast till night and toward the dusk of the evening after prayers used constantly on that day to take his station on the strand to see the girls of the town pass in review before him till he had fixed upon his object whom he would invite home to his own chambers to supper he did not generally pitch upon the handsomest wench for he chose always one of a particular description she must be tall and fair but pale and redhaired  he would treat her with an elegant collation and a bottle of wine would sup with her and make her sing if she happened to have any manner of voice he would drink two or three glasses of wine and then walk musing about the room till she had finished the remainder of the bottle which if she happened to delay too long he would grow impatient and press her to with all the seeming ardour of a lover  when she had drank the buzza he would very politely take her by the hand and lead her into an inner apartment which was lighted up with half a dozen large wax tapers there was no bed in this room but a large oak table in the middle of it upon which was placed a very handsome cedar coffin lined with white satin neatly crimped and quilted with the foot of it placed directly opposite to the door  then taking up a fine pinked shroud he would put it into the girls hand and a guinea into the other desiring her to strip herself to her shift and lie down in the coffin just like a corpse with her arms placed crosswise over her bosom and her eyes shut and when she had composed herself in this manner to express one heavy moan and then remain motionless and silent as the grave while this sad office was performing he would through decency retire out of the room and wait at the door till he heard the sigh or signal of admission  he would then open the door softly as if he apprehended he was going to pay a visit to the sick and march up slowly to the foot of the coffin then start as if surprised stand aghast wring his hands take out his handkerchief and move step by step up to the head of the coffin sobbing weeping and sighing all the way as if lamenting over some dear and real loss then after gazing for some minutes on her face he would lay his hand gently on the breast of the living corpse stoop down his head and give her a parting and a passionate kiss this obsequy performed he would immediately retire out of the room leaving the girl at leisure to redress herself and walk about her business in quest of more lively sport  at first when he took up this very odd fancy it was with great difficulty he could get a girl to undergo this dismal ceremony especially as the very idea of death must occasion shocking reflections to reprobates besides they were not aware how far the farce might have been intended to be carried on so that it used to cost him three four sometimes five or six guineas to purchase a corpse to his mind but in a short time he became so well known on the strand that he was styled the weeping cull and whenever he appeared all the long ghostlike gingers used to crowd about him and offer themselves voluntarily to perform a scene in his tragedy which reduced the price at length to a supper and a guinea  his story was this he had been for some years in love with a young lady of the description in the latter end of the third paragraph of this chapter she returned his passion with a reciprocal flame but her father who was a rich citizen of london opposed their union because she was his only child and that he was in hopes of matching her into some decayed noble family whose arms might want supporters  the lovers were immediately separated upon the first overture of the match and became inconsolable but the lady having a more tender sense of such disappointments pined for some time fell afterward into a decay and the physicians at length began to despair of her recovery her father was moved at this report consented to the marriage and gave her leave to acquaint her lover with the news  he was at this time near an hundred miles from london taking possession of his estate about five hundred pounds a year upon his fathers death the moment he received the joyful summons he mounted his horse and rode off post to london when he arrived he found the house open and stole up stairs directly to her apartment without meeting any body in his way but when he opened the chamber door and was going to rush into the arms of his beloved mistress he saw her just laid in her coffin  he grew immediately distracted fell into a fever and was confined to his bed and room for near six months before he recovered his health and reason some part of the phrenzy still remained with him there is a pleasure in indulging gloomy reflections he was resolved to enjoy them and immediately instituted the above funeral rite to her memory to be performed weekly on her deathday which extraordinary and funest extravagance he had continued for above a year when mr carewe quitted the temple and resolved to persevere in during the remainder of his life  chap cxliv soon after i had been settled at the temple continued mr carewe i received a letter from the fair divorcee which had been returned to me from oxford it was in these words  dear trustee the first half year of my alimony will be due tomorrow i am distressed for money i beg the favor of you to discharge it immediately  without advice which i hate i lodge at mr seawells merchant in leadenhallstreet london and am dear guardian your dutiful ward and affectionate humble servant   this hint rendered me uneasy she had betrayed dangerous principles and i was afraid of entering into any manner of connection with her i did not care to have her name joined to mine on my first setting out in the world mens characters are generally marked though very unfairly by their first steps in life it is hard to judge of persons at an age when their passions are strongest their discretion weakest and their experience least my first adventure with that lady was naturally unavoidable this would have been morally premeditative  upon this reflection i immediately sat down and drew a bill upon her husband for the half years stipend which received due honor by the return of the post the next day i went to the royal exchage inquired for mr seawell and paid him the money for his fair lodger taking his receipt in her name i desired him to deliver my compliments to the lady and make an apology for my not waiting on her at that time as i was then going out of town etc  chap cxlv the first masquerade that was exhibited in london after my entrance at the temple i prepared myself for in the gayest and most superb manner i could devise i dressed myself perfectly en turc and carried the folly to such extravagance that the expenses of my habit and appurtenances amounted to above an hundred pounds  the vanity of human nature is unaccountable in some things what possible advantage or enjoyment could i have purposed to myself from so magnificent an appearance unknowing others and myself unknown to spend money upon passions or pursuits is defensible but it is really a sort of suicide in economy to stab ones fortune without having either pleasure or profit in view  the oddness and variety of the appearances surprised and diverted me for some time but i soon grew tired of the farce and felt myself offended at seeing human nature so deformed and so disguised i had no rational amusement here for i could neither enjoy society nor soliloquy at one time i compared myself to adam when he had collected together all the animals of the creation to call them names at another time a more serious image occurred to me of the last day when all the various nations of the earth shall be gathered into one groupe for judgment  such reflections with the intolerable warmth of the room soon began to lower my spirits and i retired frequently to the sideboards to recruit them i happened to drink too freely there and afterward engaged too indiscreetly at play with a set of persons whose characters i was as little acquainted with as with their masks  i had the misfortune to have won considerably at first which excited my passion and joined to the wine threw me entirely off my guard i pushed away at every thing accepted all manner of betts without waiting to compute the odds and lost and won by turns without ever considering how the balance of accounts stood for or against me till upon the summing up of the reckoning at the close of the night i found myself indebted to sundry unknowns to the amount of three thousand five hundred pounds  i felt myself in a very awkward and distressed situation at this period as i had not above three hundred pounds about me at that time i took off my mask to let my creditors see that i was not afraid to show my face though at the same time i acknowledged to them that i was ashamed to do it that i was unused to play and had engaged myself unawares beyond my present means i told them that i was a person of fortune sufficient to answer their demands and offered to go with them to a tavern and pass securities for their respective claims  they refused me this indulgence said that playdebts were not recoverable at law that it was probable a man who could among perfect strangers accept of betts beyond his purse might be likely to plead the statute when called upon for payment that they were gentlemen persons of honor would be treated as such and so forth  while they were one and all bullying after this manner they surrounded me and seemed to make one common cause of it as in truth i believe they were an associated gang so that i had great reason to apprehend some harsh treatment or unhappy event from this foolish adventure from which i was preparing to defend myself after the best manner i could and had just laid my hand to my scymetar when a little man in a domino who had stood close by my side from the time i had entered into play and had frequently warned me unheeded interposed on my behalf and addressing himself to the banditti said that he did not look upon the debt in such a desperate light as they seemed to do that from my dress my indiscretion and my ingenuousness it was reasonable to suppose me to be a young man of modern fashion that according to the gamesters phrase he was ready to back his opinion with his money and that if they would but wait his return for a few minutes he would bring cash sufficient to satisfy their demands  he retired immediately took a chair came soon back with east india bonds to the amount of my debts and divided them among the adventurers in proportion to their claims i was affected with a proper sense of gratitude upon this occasion and invited the little domino to a tavern in order to pass a security to him for his generous loan but he excused himself saying that he was in reality an usurer that a simple obligation would not answer his purpose and he would wait upon me the next morning to breakfast and there propose his terms i thanked him however and gave him my address  we then shook hands and parted  i was extremely happy at having got so well rid of this unluky adventure and quitted that grotesque assembly with a full resolution of never wearing a fools coat there again during my life just as i was going out i was accosted by a female mask in a grecian habit and of an engaging figure who addressed herself to me in these words  i am in a difficult situation seignior i have missed my company in the crowd i am afraid of venturing home alone and beg leave to place myself under your highnesss protection to convey me safe to my lodgings  yours extempore said i then taking her by the hand put her into a chair desiring her to lead the way and followed her in another when we stopped at her door i bad her farewell and directed my chair to the temple but she insisted on my going in to drink a glass of wine and receive the thanks of her friends for my politeness and galantry toward her  i bowed obeisance handed her into the house she led me into her own apartments then shutting the door let fall her mask and sprang my fair divorcee into my arms   chap cxlvi the reader perhaps may here inquire how the divorcee should know mr carewes name and address or he himself happen to be informed of either of these particulars relative to her husband as none of them appear to have been provided for already but it is more than probable that the trustdeed between these parties was drawn up by the attorney with all the usual forms and requisites among which the real names of the contractors with their additions and abodes are always fully expressed  i must confess however that my friend mr carewe has rather too succinct a manner of telling a story  too little of the narrative by a great deal witness the close of the last chapter with many other disappointing instances of the same kind in various and sundry places of his memoirs he might perhaps have been pardonable for omitting those minutiae at first because he might not have immediately foreseen that they would be necessary in the prosecution of his story but here he was certainly inexcusable to neglect it and should have interrupted himself with a but gentlemen first it is necessary to inform you that  or i had forgot to mention to ye in the former part of my adventure with this same lady how etc  i would give fifty guineas with all my heart that this same laconic triumvirate had been better read than they appear to be in the modern novels and memoirs which are published here every day and i would engage to make cent per cent of my money by it too for there is certainly matter sufficient in their stories to have furnished out a third volume to this work had they been properly skilled in the manner style and conduct of such performances but so far from supplying me with any helps of this kind i really think that i should hardly have squeezed out more than a single volume from among this costive trio if i had not eked out a second by the address of introducing myself so often no matter how impertinently into the scene and chorussing it away chapter after chapter in the manner i am holding forth at present  i agree with mr carewe entirely that masquerades can never answer any fair purpose in england it might have been a good contrivance enough in italy where they were first contrived because the only freedom that nation enjoys is under a vizard but to adopt such a screen in these kingdoms was really superfluous and the present age seems to be sensible of this absurdity at last for masquerades have been abolished of late since liberty has become so very barefaced as it appears to be in these days  you see here another mere casual adventure of poor mr carewes he had taken all prudent means and virtuous resolutions imaginable against renewing any manner of commerce with this very dangerous woman  but he happened to take off his mask at play and she immediately lays violent hands upon him now what security in this wicked world for male chastity for if men should ever become coy women will most certainly ply stratagem against them  chap cxlvii the next morning said mr carewe i rose early my double obligations to my little domino both of equity and honor rendered me uneasy the fair divorcee pressed me to be frequent in my visits i promised her maid lent me a ridinghood to conceal my grand seigniorship and led me out through a back door into a private alley i soon met a chair and returned pleased and dissatisfied resolving and irresolute home to my chambers in the temple  after breakfast my friend domino called upon me and brought a bond ready filled up for the money exactly which he had advanced for me the night before i thought it prudent in him not to add the fee of usury in the obligation but after i had signed the deed i threw my purse upon the table and desired him to pay himself whatever gratuity he pleased out of it  but he declined my offer saying that the expression he had thrown out the night before was merely made use of to conceal himself the better  that he never had dealt in usury or extortion but being cashier to a company of merchants in the city he usually attended incog at public places of play in order to pick up securities for money which he could venture to make free with and which it might be imprudent in him to hazard in trade or lend out in the offices of notaries lest it should take wind among the company  then putting the bond into his pocket and rising up from his seat i hope sir said he that this transaction instead of a debt may become a purchase to you a proper reflection upon this marked occasion may turn your loss to gain the entering into play in your circumstances of fortune sufficient but not abounding is give me leave to say unpardonble indiscretion it is risquing what you want for what you do not need it is aesops fable exactly hazarding the substance to grasp the shadow  you seem sir continued he to be a young man just entering into life of a liberal and ingenuous nature and a few more admonitions from experience may and i hope will be both useful and necessary to you always leave your purse at home never carrying more money about you than the probable expenses of the day for you will find more borrowers than lenders in this world believe me as you should conceal your vices out of decency so should you even your very virtues out of prudence otherwise the least worthy objects being the most forward will be apt to throw themselves in your way preventing modest merit seek occasion rather than suffer it to seek you and let your liberality be the result of virtue not of weakness this said he bowed and retired  he was a meanlooking middleaged man and mechanically dressed which made his refusing the praemium with the officious friendship which he testified toward me upon this occasion seem the more unaccountable and extraordinary in fine his words and actions were so much above his appearances that i could only reconcile them in my mind by setting the whole of this matter down to the account of character with which as i observed before our nation so peculiarly abounds  his exhortation had this good effect upon me that i immediately put down my equipage and disposed of my hounds and hunters in the country  chap cxlviii i had promised the divorcee to see her again and accordingly paid her a visit in a few days after with a purpose though of withdrawing myself from any manner of future engagement with her but without that abruptness which would have been inconsistent with the decorums of galantry it was in the evening i found her at home and mrs seawell at whose house she lodged at tea with her  mrs seawell was about twenty years old and had been two years married her husband had been a widower and appeared to me when i saw him on the exchange to be above sixty she was of a middle stature fair and plump she had bright dark chesnutcoloured hair and very white teeth anne of austria used to say that good teeth were the most natural beauty because the only one that was of real use  but what was extremely remarkable they were naturally brilliant cut so that when she spoke or smiled the glittering spangles would catch the eye and rivet your attention like the basilisk  her other features were nothing extraordinary except her eyes which were a dark blue with more of languishment than spirit in them but she had a certain riantcy about the lower part of her face which was extremely captivating in fine the contrasted air of her features might well be compared to a tragicomedy there was such a mixture of mirth and melancholy in them  she did not appear to have much understanding but whenever i spoke she seemed to show an attention that was flattering and when i happened occasionally to throw out any little compliment of galantry toward her it would instantly diffuse such an air of awkward fondness over all her countenance as was at once expressive both of passion and compliance  we three played parties of picquette and supped together it was postnight and mr seawell did not quit his office while i staid nor indeed did either of the ladies send any very pressing messages to invite him up stairs i divided my addresses as equally as i could between them felt my situation difficult and distressing promised that my visits should be frequent and retired home to the temple  no  it was to my private lodgings near it  chanting out macheaths song to myself all the way  chap cxlix the next day some young templars dined with me we went in the evening to the play picked up more company there and went all together to supper at a tavern here gentlemen said mr carewe i blush to own that i was a second time led into deep play though without designing or desiring it but resolution was never among my heroics and i have ever been the slave of my company one is too apt to be ashamed of dissenting from their fellows and false modesty is a pimp to vice i lost at first and pushing away to retrieve myself was finally involved for four thousand pounds  purchasing anxiety at the rate of a thousand pounds an hour  i could not sleep all night i felt shocked at my own madness i recollected my good friend dominos advice too late and eked it out with more severe reflections of my own gaming is a vice not a passion passions have bounds vices none  it should not be called a love but a lust of play  it is not natural but accidental to mankind what addison says of swearing may be here applied that no one can plead the being born of a gaming constitution ambition is connate it is emulation it both excites and exercises noble and generous faculties it has or may have some great and liberal end in view play is merely selfish and confines the soul to mean and sordid objects no man ever yet ventured his fortune on the die with a purpose of relieving the poor assisting the distressed or rescuing an oppressed people with his success a gamester comprehends the character both of fool and knave for he sets out a dupe and returns a sharper but what signify all such reflections the world will never be the better for them  for it is not sober counsel but sad experience that will ever make men wise  chap cl the next morning i began to meditate upon methods of discharging this most irksome encumbrance and recollecting that i had some valuable woods on my estate i wrote directly to my agent to get them valued and then come up to london he did as i had directed and told me the purchase was computed at about five thousand pounds upon which i desired him to publish the sale in the papers comforting myself after my too careless manner that those trees which had been before but nests for ravens were likely now to become habitations for men  soon after the advertisement had appeared in print i received a visit from my extraordinary friend the little domino who after some short intercourse of civility asked me what sudden emergency had pressed upon me since our parting to sacrifice the honors as he expressed himself of my estate has any public calamity fallen upon the times is some dear friend or fond connection languishing at present in a gaol or  i was piqued at his sarcasm and interrupted him peevishly with saying that often the heaviest circumstance of being in debt was the rendering oneself liable to the overbearing insolence of purseproud creditors that i was not accountable to any person whatsoever for the exercise of a dominion over my own estate etc  the domino collected himself upon this rebuke and made an apology for the freedom he had used by assuring me that he came to wait upon me merely as a friend and was prepared to advance whatever sum i might need upon the present occasion in order to spare my woods which he told me he was informed would not be in a condition to fell with advantage for several years to come  i felt myself ashamed at the folly and extravagance which had humbled me to such mortifying circumstances my resentment immediately subsided i thanked him for his friendly offer accepted it passed my bond to him for four thousand pounds and ran to discharge my notes of honor on the instant  chap cli when i had composed myself a little after this disagreeable adventure i went to amuse myself one morning to leadenhallstreet i found the two ladies sitting together and mrs seawell attempting to read a french book into english for the entertainment of her friend who did not understand a word of the language  she stopped on my coming in but i begged she would proceed for a page or two that i might be able to judge how far she was a mistress of french she read on a little farther but finding her to be a mere dictionary scholar like most of our modern translators i took the book out of her hand and construed a few pages with an ease and fluency which pleased them both  it was le sopha and coming to that passage where the writer speaking of the proneness to intrigue in women imputes it principally a le de saeuvremnt perpetuel dans lequel else languissent i shut the book crying out in a transport deus nobis haec otia fecit and putting it into my pocket asked the ladies to take the air with me a little way out of town promising that i would finish the remainder of the novel for them in the coach they accepted the invitation and we drove off to ranelagh together  the day was fine and after we had walked a turn or two in the gardens we sat ourselves down in an arbor and the ladies claimed my promise of reading the sopha to them to which i replied that i would first give mrs seawell some instructions in french as she seemed to need only a few lessons in the auxiliaries to become a complete scholar the dear pupil appeared pleased at my proposal the other lady opposed it but being outvoted was obliged to sit dully and impatiently by  i then began pedantically enough with the verb avoir and went very seriously through the indicative and imperative moods but when i came to the optative potential and subjunctive parts of the conjugation the very titles hinted an applicable subject to me so digressing from old grammar i laid hold of this opportunity of telling her in french that the difficulty of separating her from her companion had reduced me to this ruse damour to frame an occasion of declaring the purest and warmest passion for her that i had been struck at first sight and this so strongly too that ages could neither increase nor diminish my flame  that  but here perceiving her countenance falling into some confusion i quick shifted my discourse to some of the tenses of the verb and then speaking to her in english desired her to repeat any speech psalm or prayer she had by heart in french in order to try her pronunciation  she then spoke a stanza or two of une chanson a boire and having by that time recovered herself a little concluded it by thanking me for the compliment i had paid her and assuring me in a sort of hesitating voice and embarrassed manner that while i should preserve the decorums of platonics which was all her present circumstances could admit of she would return my passion with the warmest friendship and esteem  all this she spoke in a broken and interrupted manner as if she was only trying to recollect the remainder of her song then speaking in english said with an arch smile that this was enough for the first lesson and turning to her friend cried indeed my dear you miss a vast pleasure in not understanding french during all this while the discontented lady sat by throwing out every now and then such interjections as these vastly entertaining perfectly polite some folks are rude to show their breeding is this the beau monde this what they call the bon ton what the gay the ingenious mr carewe turned schoolmaster to teach parrots to speak etc  chap clii after this manner and in walking we amused the time till mrs seawell looking at her watch told us it was just three oclock and full time to set out toward london i was sent off to order the coach to the door and returning soon back led the ladies into a little parlour where a small but elegant collation had been prepared by my private directions on our first coming into the house  i immediately seated myself at the table entreating the favor of my fair guests to take their places on each side of me which the divorcee readily consented to and placed herself directly on my right hand but mrs seawell hesitated a little lest her husband might be displeased at her staying abroad without notice the other laughed at her scruples saying my dear friend it is good policy sometimes to act a little irregularly in innocent and indifferent matters so shall you be at liberty in things of higher moment practice swimming my girl within your depth and it may save you at a plunge she smiled and blushed she seemed in the most delicate temper imaginable  at once both willing and afraid i arose took her by the warm trembling hand pressed it tenderly and seated her at the table  we were each of us extremely lively drank briskly exhausted all the modern wit of sentimental toasting and our whole conversation was supported with spirit and galantry the divorcee spoke her opinions pretty freely upon this latter subject and while she meant only to justify her own amor she was without perceiving or intending it assisting mine  when we had got into the coach to return to london i proposed to my pretty pupil that we should converse in french together for a while upon any common topic just to try how far she had profited of my lessons in the morning the other lady who in truth preferred plain english objected but was as before overruled in the question which left us again at our liberty  i took advantage of this second favorable crisis to urge my now increasing passion with the united warmth of youth and wine to which she answered in a tender accent that if she had never done so before she did at that instant most cordially wish that she had never been yet married to this objection i quick replied that hearts were made before vows and that nature was prior to obligation adding that if she would make herself perfect mistress of the language we were then conversing in she must entirely accommodate herself to the manners of that nation who are our instructors in it  to give you an example now continued i all the difference that the polite french make between matrimony and intrigue is that they term the first menage and the latter manege  the transposition of a single letter only  so that the strictest moralist can make but a literal error of it at most to youth and passion mellowed by champaigne any sophistry is good logic shakespeare has an happy expression to this purpose in his coriolanus  i will watch him till he be dieted to my request   i kissed her at parting and in return she pressed my hand i lay at my private lodgings that night and the next morning discharged them  chap cliii what mr carewe says of the divorcees helping forward his intrigue with mrs seawell puts me in mind of a note of the greek scholiast upon menanders fall of woman it is quoted in latin by one of the commentators upon ovid de art amandi and my translation must be from this latter having never seen the original  to employ one woman to inveigle another is like setting a knave to catch a knave a female confidante or companion will contribute more to the success of an amor in one month than the galants own assiduity for twelve consider the times and seasons they are together with the power of example added to precept

and debauched court was an example of virtue prudence and conjugal love but twas also remarkable of her that she never spit in her life   here follows an anatomical dissertation on the body female with a physical account of the effects of passion upon the noble parts the head the heart the etc and the whole is concluded with this quaint expression  in short says he women undo one another like cockles  this image is really ridiculous enough but it is in the strong manner of the ancient simile and i have never been able to see the hinges of two cockles turned against each other since and niggling themselves open without thinking of the old scholiast on menander or the fall of woman  chap cliv we three had frequent parties together in london at the play the tavern and the chinashops where i laid out a good deal of money in presents to both of the ladies for i thought it necessary to show some more certain tokens of fondness and galantry to my lovely seawell than mere professions and caresses win her with gifts if she respect not words dumb jewels often in their silent kind more than quick words do move a womans mind shakespeare  and to have neglected the same compliment to the other lady might have raised both a jealousy and a suspicion and would not have been either prudent or polite  however all my caution did not avail me long for my attentions my languishments on one side with some unpardonable neglects and omissions on the other soon visibly marked the preference the forsaken fair had betrayed a good deal of uneasiness and pique at this once or twice before but one night after supper at a tavern when my pupil and i were exchanging a few bons mots in french she started up from the table expressing her resentment in these words  though i do not understand your tongues said she i do your eyes i have long suspected it but being slow to censure  or perhaps to think so meanly of my own age or person as to imagine they could for many years yet to come be used to cloak anothers amor i have  but i am trespassing on your patience or rather impatience i dare swear  waiter call me a chair  i shall leave you together incontinently here to consummate your unfinished loves a chair  a chair  below there   she was an alarming figure all together her eyes flashed fire her cheeks flushed blood her whole frame was convulsed and her charms became at the same instant both heightened and deformed enraged beauty strikes us with a peculiar kind of shock it raises a contrasted sensation in our breasts both of love and aversion we are affected at once with horror and compassion  i attempted all in my power to soothe her rage  denied the charge and in my hurry and confusion vowed that she and she alone was the true object of my real passion  that  but before i could frame or add another syllable my ear was assaulted by a dying moan and turning my eye quick about i perceived the fainting seawell falling from her chair i fled to her assistance caught her in my arms called her my life my love  in plain english  having quite forgot my french in this moment of distraction i leaned her back sprinkled water in her face and kissed it dry again till she recovered  all this while the enraged roxana went on exclaiming against my disingenuousness and perfidy and ringing the bell for a chair i ordered a second to be called she flung herself into one i placed my poor trembling pupil in the other and ran along by the side of it vowing professing and stammering all the way till we got near her house then slunk off for fear of being espied by the jealous termagant and returned home to the temple in the utmost perplexity and confusion  chap clv i could not compose my spirits sufficiently that night to lie down in my bed and sat up till daybreak musing over the taper my reflections ran thus i was apprehensive lest the violence of the disappointed divorcee might transport her to expose the fair victim to her husband i was resolved to vindicate her actual innocence and to support her through the consequences of our mutual indiscretion so far as it had already proceeded and was so affected with the dangerous situation to which my libertinism had reduced her that i resolutely determined never more to revisit leadenhallstreet again and compounded for the loss of a fond mistress by the getting rid of a jealous virago  having thus far qualified the difficulty and uneasiness of my mind i began to turn my thoughts inward on myself  what a life is mine without purpose or end  as if there was no more behind but such a day tomorrow as to day and to be boy eternal  winters tale  youth flies and fortune wastes in what a venture am i engaged and what a shipwreck must he endanger whose gale is passion whose pilot inexperience and whose port is no where  then upon comparing my temple with my college life  that letters love and economy  this dissipation debauchery and extravagance  i started from my chair crying out where is she my lovely academic now my virtuous mistress my disinterested friend my society alone o why not sum up all these dear appellations in one still more dear and comprehensive term my wife and she shall be mine if love approbation and selection can entitle me to her or that the confessing myself the base indian now repentant may win her from her delicacy and scruples but is she not already so our souls are one and our bodies have been each others  for marriage is a matter of more worth than to be dealt in by attorneyship with these reflections and with this resolve i laid me down to rest and awakened with the same for sleep by composing my spirits and calming my reason had but the more firmly determined my purpose i perceived the vanity of life the clearer where nothing stable is but love and virtue which when conjoined stake this world as an earnest of the next  consideration like an angel came and whipped the offending adam out of him leaving his body as a paradise to envelope and contain celestial spirits chap clvi my sentiments with regard to the charming eloisa were not at first solely the deductions of reason but rather the inspirations of passion this will surprise you perhaps i had parted from her with tolerable ease to myself because i had the satisfaction to have no manner of apprehensions subsisting upon her own account i had left her safe both in fortune and in virtue so far had i acquitted myself to the calls of honor and the claims of justice and on my own part i had youth frolic and adventure before me to keep up my spirits on the parting  but i had never passed a day since our last adieu without wishing for her society nor a night without longing for her fellowship women and wine had lost their flavor company became insipid books dry and amor wanted zest in fine she was my health which i had insensibly enjoyed in the possession and only lamented in the loss  my last nights shock had like a burningglass collected all these scattered rays of love and virtue together in an instant and their vis unita force was irresistible my resolves are sudden and my action quick i took posthorses immediately and drove down to oxford  my inquiry about her there was fruitless i was informed that he had lived entirely sequestered from the time i quitted college appearing only at the public lectures and the public service and that as soon as he had taken his degree he had struck his name out of the books and retired whither unknown without having taken leave of any body  i lay that night in the town and was preparing to pursue my dear fugitive further the next morning when some select friends of mine who had become fellows of the university and had been informed of my arrival came to the inn and arrested my course we loved one another we walked together over the classic ground particularly the park where my dear chum had related to me all her transactions with her grandfather and o where the action with ap shones had happened which was the prologue to my happiness  we spent the day together often speaking of our pretty collegiate as they called her and at several times i was in danger of exposing the secret by the transports that i found it difficult to restrain upon the mention of her name i loitered at old almas for a week purposing every morning to depart my stronger affections urged me to go but my more immediate ones induced me to stay such is the nature of man cadmus being dispatched by his father agenor in pursuit of his eloped sister europa happened to be struck with the beauties of a particular situation and built the city of thebes in his way   chap clvii from oxford i proceeded to our former sojourn for the double pleasure of embracing my little hermes and hearing probably some account of his dear mother but in both was i disappointed my old landlady informed me that about a month before a very pretty young gentleman who called himself my wifes brother and was as like her as a twin had come to his house brought a maidservant in the chair with him and carried away the child who had been long weaned and was a fine healthy lovely boy  this additional circumstance sunk my spirits to the lowest ebb i felt a double loss at once a wife and son  and in the latter was deprived also of the only clue i had to trace the mother by i was now arrived at the ne plus ultra of my pursuit for i neither knew her grandfathers name or abode she had never mentioned him to me by any other title than the old colonel or grandsire  nor indeed had i ever asked her any thing about the matter myself because from the awkward circumstance of my own family affair i did not choose to be communicative in the like particular myself nay the same reserve i have still continued to preserve even toward you gentlemen said he to mr andrews and beville for carewe is not my real name but only one that i have assumed to myself because i did not care to use my own while my father and i remain upon such unhappy terms  thus was i blown out to sea again  but though i lost my haven i was resolved to take what care i could of the cargo and for one instance of it i immediately wrote a letter to the gentleman with whom i happened to have the adventure at this house desiring him to make his remittances of alimony through the hands of mr seawell for the future telling him that i found it very inconvenient to act any longer as agent in that business  i did not however resign the office of trustee at the same time  the most worthless person the greatest criminal has a right to justice from us though not to favor and a breach of confidence is something more than an offense against morals  chap clviii i felt myself in the world alone i had now no point of view to guide my perspective no referable object to direct my actions toward the mind is active and like a conjured demon will raze or build a church according to the spell that raised it tam ficti pravique tenax quam nuntia very i returned back forlorn to london to folly intemperance and to single joys however i shut myself up in my chambers at first and studied law with great application in order to keep my attention from wandering upon outward objects and to attach it to some rational pursuit in life  about a fortnight after i had thus sequestered myself from the world i received the followed billet one morning dear sir a certain friend of yours is at present in a very unhappy situation  if you are a gentleman of honor you will repair instantly to leadenhallstreet and there you shall hear the particulars from dear sir your truly afflicted and most humble servant  jane seawell     this note alarmed me i concluded that some awkward piece of business must have fallen out from the jealous resentment of the divorcee but whatever it might be i was resolved to bear myself through it like a man so putting on my sword i took coach and drove off directly to the rendezvous appointed  when i arrived at the house i was led into the parlour where i found mr and mrs seawell together and alone he was walking in a disturbed manner about the room while she sat weeping in the window just as i guessed said i to myself mr seawell received me with a formal and embarrassed air and his wife wiping her eyes rose quickly from her seat and running toward me cried out oh sir  our poor unhappy friend is lost ruined and undone  i was shocked greatly at this state of the case but began soon to grow easier in my mind than i had felt myself on my entrance and desiring to be informed of the nature and circumstances of that unfortunate ladys difficulties mr seawell gave me the following account  chap clix a young merchant jew just entered on the change having had frequent business to transact at my counter was often invited to my table where this lady was always one of the company she threw out her lure and encouraged his addresses extempore this was obvious enough on the first interview but as there may be flirts who would not be strumpets i suffered the amor to be carried on before my face for about a fortnight till her behavior at last her affecting always to sit by him her laying hold of his hand to fix him in discourse her fond inclinings her gloting eyes etc began to give me such offense and alarm too on account of the example before my wife that i marked it to both the lovers the last night they supped together here and forbore asking him farther than my countingoffice for the future whenever his business gave him pretense to call upon me  this difficulty embarrassed the inamoratos a good deal and reduced them to the necessity of making appointments elsewhere they met in the park at the play and other places which are not material to the story therefore i shall now pass on to the present crisis of this business  this morning she was arrested at my house upon an information for having stolen a diamond ring value five hundred pounds from the jew she immediately threw herself at my feet continued mr seawell supplicating me not to suffer her to be hurried away to a gaol before she had an opportunity of speaking a word or two with the merchant whom she entreated me to go for in person and bring to her on the instant my wife joined in the request i prevailed on the bailiffs to wait my return and immediately repaired to the jews lodgings  he told me the whole course of the intrigue ever since the last evening they had passed together at my house till two nights past when she was prevailed upon to sup with him at his own lodgings here said he i happened to amuse her by showing a parcel of valuable jewels which had been consigned to me by a correspondent at venice and were that evening just come to hand  yesterday morning said he i missed the ring in question and wrote her a civil line to know whether she had taken it way either in mistake or jest to alarm me to which she replied that she knew nothing at all of the matter had not even distinguished the ring from the rest of the jewels and lastly that i was welcome to her affidavit if i should be mean and ungenerous enough to charge her still with so base a fraud  her answer confounded me continued he i could no longer suspect her after this last paragraph  though she is a christian  such was the jews expression i then looked all through my bureau again searched my rooms and my pockets above twenty times but in vain by this time said he the day was far spent so that it was late before i could go about the city to give notice at all the jewellers shops but had the mortification to find that my warning came too late for that the ring had been disposed of at one of them early in the morning by an ordinary woman who appeared to be a servantmaid  upon this i began to challenge the purchaser for having ventured to buy such a commodity in so clandestine a manner but he stopped me short by acquainting me that in this particular he had conducted himself with sufficient mercantile caution for upon suspecting the persons who had offered the ring to sale he had threatened to detain her till she should be able to give him a satisfactory account both of herself and the jewel  upon this said he she led me to one mr seawells house in leadenhallstreet where a lady of a very responsible appearance who it seems lodges there vouched the property to be her own upon which i returned with the wench back again to my shop and paid her before witnesses what i hope may be deemed pretty near the value of the ring  after this continued the jew i thought i had no other measure to keep but that of justice i immediately gave in examinations before a magistrate and have now delivered the wretched woman over into the hands of the law where she shall abide her doom for me i pressed him to come along with me to see her at least as she had so earnestly requested but he peremptorily refused for to what purpose said he i would not forgive the debt even to a jew much less the theft to a christian  i then returned home concluded mr seawell and delivered the prisoner up to the bailiffs who carried her immediately away and lodged her in the poultrycompter that foolish chickenhearted woman there added he fell into distraction at the merited distress of her hopeful friend and wrote you the note which has brought you sir hither and given you a trouble that i apprehend can possibly answer no manner of purpose in the world  the lovely seawell then falling on her knees before me implored my assistance toward rescuing our poor unhappy friend from her miserable situation i would snatch her from the ground but she was immovable in her suit i promised every thing in my power said that it was not easy to frame any manner of device on the instant but i would fly to comfort her and consult together all possible means of saving her life at least justice forbids it added i but humanity intercedes even for vice i then raised the suppliant fair but in the midst of my moral found myself ever i was aware pressing her hand somewhat too tenderly  chap clx when i entered the gaol i felt myself affected with a crowd of sensations and reflections the noisome scents the sallow complexions the squalid garments shocked my sight and smell but i found myself much more disturbed at the boisterous merriment i heard among the prisoners which made their wretchedness appear still more wretched and added bedlam to the mint  i spied the unhappy woman sitting in a corner of the common hall her face all pale with guilt and dread her arms crossed over her breast and eyes turned up to heaven while a parcel of raggamuffins male and female were rifling her pockets for garnish the oppressed oppressing  how i felt is not to be described her beauty her vice  her situation her sex  that form which i had once folded in my arms with fondness and desire her jealousy my vanity  her distress and my compassion i scattered money among the contending mob seized her arm and hurried her into an inner room before she could perceive who i was then taking her gently by the hand and beginning to speak i know not what my tongue stood still and my eyes oerflowed  the moment she observed me she gave a loud shriek her strength failed her and she sunk down upon the floor murmuring to herself this is too much o justice to be confronted with the person who knows so many vices in me loaded as i am with guilt this added shame reaches beyond my powers it gave me extreme satisfaction to find her susceptible of any spark of virtue of humility or contrition i raised her up embraced her bid her repent hope and depend upon my utmost exertion in her defense  she then confessed the felony to me pretending that had i been constant to her this misfortune could never have happened that love alone with me would have satisfied all her desires but finding herself disappointed in that fond wish she had resolved to make all her future amors subservient to her interest  she told me that with this view she had engaged in an intrigue with the jew because he was reckoned rich that she had endeavored to get money from him once or twice on pretense of being considerably in debt but sound him to be a meanspirited fellow and that she was tempted to slip the ring into her bosom in order to pay herself imagining that perhaps he might not have readily missed it from among so large a parcel of jewels or that if he should she might possibly not have been suspected might wheedle him out of it or finally compound the matter with him by restoring it again but  having once obtained the quiet possession of the prize said she my avarice began to lay violent hands upon it and the temptation proved alas too strong for my weakness  thus continued she did i sap the foundations of my honesty as i had done before of my chastity by salvos my first failure  i may deem it my only one  for one breach in virtue renders a woman bankrupt for life honor is our true virginity  dishonor never strikes us twice  my affair with the unfortunate young man that is dead said she with a sigh and a tear was never intended or the consequences even apprehended by me he was forward and took freedoms which i permitted rather for want of breeding than of modesty and i finding still my purpose honest indulged too great a latitude to my actions determining however most resolutely to oppose the last attack  but alas he had gained ground on me so gradually and insensibly that the last favor being but little more than what he had obtained the day before i was ruined ever i perceived my danger she then concluded her account of that adventure with this very just and prudent reflection women said she who do not take up arms against the first attempt will scarce become heroines upon the last  chap clxi i staid to dinner with her in this wretched scene endeavoring to support her spirits by frequent assurances of my friendship and compassion which i promised to exert for her service to the utmost shilling of my fortune but at the same time strongly recommending to her an unfeigned penitence and a thorough reformation of life prepare yourself for death added i not through despair but by the only preparation that is fit for life hope and virtue she wept vowed and prayed  at parting i desired her to give me the money she had received on the sale of the ring that i might carry it to the jew and endeavor to bribe him into a composition of the felony with it here she fell into tears again exclaiming out oh sir too surely is folly the natural concomitant of vice i thought i should have screened myself by employing another person and one unknown to dispose of the jewel and i imagined i might have safely entrusted my own maid who had lived with me since we were both of us children  but she has never returned to me since she received the money  no matter i replied the expedient i intended shall be supplied out of my own purse  so promising to return the next morning i retired without taking any other leave of her than by a bow and adieu a gaol is no scene of galantry and after my first transport of humanity toward her was over i kept quite clear of all manner of dalliance for the remainder of the day  both upon her account and my own vice is contagious as well as distemper and i was resolved to hold no farther connection with it than what was barely necessary for its cure  however i felt myself extremely uneasy at leaving the unhappy woman in such a place and circumstance alone and would have given bail for her myself but i was told by the jailer that a positive felony would not admit it i then gave him five guineas to treat the lady with the utmost humanity and respect had her placed in the best apartment of the house and calling in at the first booksellers in my way home sent her a present of a bible a prayer book and sherlocks two discourses upon death and resurrection  chap clxii i was impatient mr reader till mr carewe had finished the last chapter that i might indulge myself in the opportunity of saying a few words upon a subject which he touches a little at in the beginning of it namely a gaol  every persons humanity though ever so universal still selects to itself one favorite object of compassion some the lunatic  others the beggar  some the slave and others the criminal mine is the marshalsea prisoner  the lunatic is a sad object indeed swift said that this was a sight which he could never look on without an inward shock i am myself  god preserve my senses as much affected at this appearance as he could be though i have not so much wit to lose  sed miserum est perdere naulum  but then this is considering the madman as an object merely  for as a subject he is frequently an happy creature  and fools bid fairest for that character  the mendicant enjoys freedom air and charity  turkish captives or galleyslaves have exercise and its sweet lacquey rest and even these or mine or row in hopes of redemption  for such is the mistaken charity of christians that they often pass by the moans of southwark and the fleet to set slaves free in barbary the culprit why he is not a prisoner for life  but for death only his confinement is but short  aut cita mors aut victoria laeta  the confined debtor is a wretch who vexed with all their griefs has not a single solace of their reliefs he has the bedlamites restraint without the ignorance of his misery he is a beggar without freedom air or charity a slave without the wholesome vicissitudes of labor and rest a prisoner without the permutatio foelix of death or liberty the criminal may have some hope from the favor of a jury or the mercy of a judge  but the harsh creditor is at once both judge jury and executioner too to the extremest letter of the law the jew of venice was tenderhearted  he would have a pound of flesh only and let the rest go free  the christian jailer skeletons the whole body with pining want manacles the limbs to noisome dungeons and wastes the mind in repinings and despair  i speak not here of common cases for i trust in my redeemer that there are but few like this for many debtors have substance and some creditors want not humanity  but i speak only of those wretches who cannot pay and those greater ones who cannot forgive see matthew chap xviii beginning at verse     under these mutual circumstances i know some who feel and others who fear a gaol from those who calling themselves christians know no other text in scripture but this there shall thou remain till thou have paid the uttermost farthing  the legislature would certainly interpose in such hard cases as these but upon the presumption that no human creature can be totally devoid of humanity the bankruptcy act does not reach it this respects only failures in trade acts of grace come nearest to the remedy but these are rare and partial passed only upon extraordinary occasions and extending but to prisoners and exiles under certain restrained descriptions  a standing act of this kind comprehending every person and at all times who was willing to take the relief of it would be necessary to abrogate this summum jus this tyranny within the law would be  a turn upon the word is unavoidable here  the most gracious act of power that could be well devised and most becoming of that government the principles and spirit of which are founded in liberty  chap clxiii as soon as i returned home said mr carewe i sent a note to my good old friend domino addressed for him at the comptinghouse where he had directed me to pay the interest of my bonds as it should become due begging the favor of him to let me have five hundred pounds if possible the next morning upon a very pressing occasion  he came to me the next day before ten oclock and brought the money along with him telling me while he was filling up the bond that this was the last shilling he had at present or might perhaps for ever have it in his power to lend no matter for that replied i so far as relates to myself for i have had a sufficient surfeit of extravagance already and i promise you that as soon as i shall have got rid of a certain difficult business which i am just now engaged in i will retire from the world to books and economy till love and matrimony which i am now in quest of added i with a sigh shall engross me sole little domino much commended both of these prudent and virtuous resolutions and took his leave  i flew immediately to leadenhallstreet to request the favor of mr seawell to carry this five hundred pounds to his friend the jew and tempt him to withdraw the prosecution as i thought that a collusion of this kind might be more successfully managed in privacy between themselves than by the negotiation of any third person it was with great difficulty i could prevail on him to transact this affair but by the assistance of his wifes tears and entreaties we at length got him out of the house  mrs seawell remained in the parlour with me till her husbands return expressing great apprehensions and concern for her friend one minute and begging of me the next to tell her the whole story of our amor for that she loved to hear little novels vastly i defended myself by replying that the present occasion was too serious a time to amuse with such light tales as this while the life of the unhappy subject of it remained still under suspense and that memoirs of the kind she seemed to imagine ours to have been were very improper and dangerous recitals for wives to listen to  lord bless me how you talk now replied she how differently from what you used to do but the extremity of your grief for the fair prisoner  though she is much fallen off in my opinion in that particular of late  has i believe made a swaddler of you prithee now could your telling an arch story of our friend among ourselves here have any manner of effect upon her trial and for my own part i really cannot see why any wife in the world might not read an intrigue this hour and say her prayers the next nay the warmer perhaps for that reason as it might afford her a hint to pray more earnestly against the temptation  i hope this last reflection mr methodist said she with a smile will please you  i laughed at her giddy liveliness but must confess that i was once or twice very near forgetting myself on this tete a tete party her morning deshabille had something extremely elegant and familiar in it her robe was loose and made of a french lutestring azure ground clouded with pale pink she had no stays on but a fine ticken vest which suffered all the pliancies of an easy wellturned shape to appear through it her bright glossy hair which had a natural curl in it flowed carelessly over her shoulders and was interwoven before with ribbon like a victim dressed for the sacrifice the few drops of pity she had just shed added another water to the brilliancy of her eyes her neck was uncovered excepting a slight black gauze handkerchief which was crossed before and folded in between her breasts to mark the parted snow she appeared to be finely limbed her slippers were of light blue persian with a silver fringe her stockings white silk and her petticoats so short that the tassels of her garters were to be seen as she sat leaning on the couch with one leg hanging over the cushion and the other reaching to the floor  her toute ensemble was so very alluring that a more perfect saint than i was might perhaps have fallen into the temptation but virtue had for me the countercharms of a new mistress i reflected on the late danger to which she had herself been exposed from the rivalship of the divorcee i ruminated upon the depth of vice which the other had fallen into from perfect innocence through one unguarded step  and could i think of exposing her to the same sin the place too warned my virtue  scipio a pagan forewent the rights of conquest from a principle of honor alone  and should i a christian dare profane the sacred laws of hospitality but more in aid to my exalted sense appeared the lovely academic like an angel heavenly bright she firmed my footsteps like a fixed point of view which guides the equilibrist safely over the precipice upon a single plank  i preserved the spirit of these reflections through my whole conversation with her softening however the austerity of them with a guarded mixture of gaiety and politeness and endeavored to recommend virtue as libertines do vice by setting forth the pleasures of it till mr seawell returned to us with an account of his having happily concluded a treaty with the jew who had been prevailed upon to accept the money and engaged not to appear upon the trial  chap clxiv i was transported at this event and so appeared the lovely seawell too at the first  but  female friendship her joy began to flatten which upon perceiving i took notice of to her she replied that it really did afford her great pleasure to find that the poor womans life was safe but feared at the same time for her wretched souls sake that she would never die so well prepared as she had a chance of doing upon this lucky warning to which she added that she apprehended still farther upon my account lest her beauty  what remained of it  her wickedness and arts might hereafter lead me into some more expensive or dangerous mishap than i had hitherto sustained from her  i returned her thanks for her friendly concern about me but assured her that all such fears for me were groundless for that vice or even beauty must assail my heart in vain whose affections were already fixed upon an adamantine rock of love and virtue and that besides with regard to the lady in question i was resolved as soon as the trial should be over to make use of all my influence to persuade her to quit the kingdom immediately and leave her shame behind her she seemed to rejoice both in my security and in my scheme and immediately offered to accompany me to the gaol to carry the happy news to her dear friend  i declined going myself at that time saying that i should not choose to see the unhappy woman till after her first emotions were over and that the acknowledgements her gratitude might prompt her to make would render me awkward and uneasy but said that i should be much pleased if she would carry the good news herself and prepare her to receive me agreeably to my own sentiments of this matter that if she would stay to dinner there i would remain with mr seawell till evening and by the time that i might imagine the ladys spirits to be a little composed he and i should wait upon them to supper her husband consented to this proposal and she went off directly in a chair  my purpose in thus putting myself upon mr seawell was with a design of cultivating an intimacy and friendship with him in order to strengthen my virtue by an alliance with my honor i had a farther view also of becoming a watchful guardian over his wifes behavior as the galantries i had practiced toward her having seemed to have had some little effect upon her mind rendered me answerable for her future conduct  chap clxv i spent the remainder of the day pleasantly enough with mr seawell and a very sensible good sort of elderly country gentleman who was his near relation and happened to dine with us our host was a plain rational man without either wit or learning but one who appeared to know the world sufficiently and to understand mercantile business extremely well i was with him for some time in his comptinghouse before dinner and after he had finished his letters for the post and that his friend had taken his leave we took coach and went to wait upon our ladies together  we found them both very properly employed the prisoner was reading one of the volumes of sherlock while mrs seawell was attending and sprigging a flower in the border of an handkerchief the fair confined upon seeing me enter the room fell on her knees i ran to take her up and vowed i would quit the place instantly if she should attempt to distress me after this manner any more  she rose immediately and asked my pardon for having forgot the generous injunction as she termed it which i had sent her by mrs seawell adding that it was increasing the obligation to do so as it must have been impossible for her to have found words strong enough to express the grateful sentiments she bore toward her kind deliverer  her compliment threw me into some confusion  from what principle in human nature does this coyness arise to call it modesty does not satisfy my philosophy neither mr andrews nor his brother returned him any solution to this proposition being unwilling to interrupt his story nor shall i enter into a disquisition upon the subject in this place for the same reason but shall content myself at present with quoting a very pretty sentiment from the peruvian letters which combats this delicacy strongly to be thoroughly generous one should listen to acknowledgements it certainly must be a kind relief to a grateful mind to be indulged in the fond pleasure of expressing its obligations it in some sort eases us of the debt  i replied that the amending of her life would overpay the gift and that her prayers and thanksgivings were fitter to be addressed to him who can redeem from sin than to one who has saved from death only  we all supped together and at parting promised to pass most of our time with her by turns till the day of trial should be over which was to come on in about ten days while she was returning us thanks for our humanity and compassion toward her wretched situation mrs seawell was hinting to me with a low voice and in french that this would be a favorable opportunity for proposing the scheme i had mentioned in the morning of her quitting the kingdom because said she it will be an easier matter to make terms with her while she may consider herself as still in your power than after her safety shall become past dispute i made no reply and felt myself much offended at her meanness the ladies exchanged tears embraces and adieus with each other and we retired  chap clxvi i passed great part of every day during her confinement with the fair reformed and in reality she appeared to be a truly penitent one i acted as her ordinary and was highly sensible of the transcendent joy of ministering to a mind diseased i used to carry a variety of books in my pocket and read select passages out of them to her fitted to alleviate her distress  sometimes she would throw herself on her knees and pray at others in a female expression of gratitude catch me in her arms and weep then with joined hands and uplifted eyes walk across the room crying out how happy was it for me to have felt this severe yet healing affliction had not divine providence in its great mercy thus awakened my soul to attention i might have still gone on from bad to worse to worst is there in sensuality an age of joy equal in poignancy or degree to one hour of that horror and anxiety i have endured since my committal hither and yet these terrors are what even the most fortunate sinners must soon or late sustain for though they should escape a scaffold a deathbed has no reprieve  at other moments she would start up from her seat with wildness and despair in her looks crying where is my husband where my children where is that generous hand which raised me from indigence to affluence and where those lovely babes that doubly blessed my fortunes you have  you have she would add suborned the evidence against my life  but oh who shall bribe off these bitter testimonies against my soul  such sad reflections and selfexpostulations as these used to throw her into swoonings almost to convulsions which i endeavored to relieve in vain till after a shower of contrite tears had assuaged the tempest in her breast and recovered her but rather to a torpid than a calm state of mind  i became quite charmed with my fair penitent she seemed sometimes inspired she talked above her reason and often exerted an energy beyond her native force i contributed every argument in my power to strengthen and confirm these good sentiments in her she only wrought herself into these ecstasies when we were alone together but she diffused the spirit of them through all her converse with mrs seawell who always spent every evening with her and thus helped to second the fair intentions which i had before conceived toward that very pretty but very weak young woman  on the postevenings mr seawell never paid us a visit and i used to walk home with my fair pupil to leadenhallstreet and deliver up my charge at the door she told me one night as i was conducting her with a nothanks to me that the divorcee had related her whole story to her at some interval she happened to be with her alone not by way of narrative but confession and gave me such warning and counsel upon several passages of it said she that i hope and believe i shall be the better for all my life  at another time she said that she really imagined our friend to be perfectly sincere in her reformation which had rendered her a truly edifying example  and yours also said she turning to me greatly confirms the strength of it for it proves that virtue may subsist even in the midst of passion to tell you the truth went she on what had put me almost out of conceit with goodness before  i mean said she catching herself up the appearances of it was that one seldom sees it preached or practiced but by certain old folk who seem to grow good merely when they are become good for nothing and poorly think to heal example by precept  i agreed with my fair moralist that this was too generally the case especially with women who once entered into vice rarely quit the sin till the sinner forsakes them and as their affections being naturally strong must be occupied and their fond hearts engaged they then become devotees and enter into a course of platonics with heaven the object only changed the passion still the same  upon the whole then replied she we had better remain as we are for women it seems are scandalous in sin and become ridiculous when they would put on the appearances of growing good again your scheme said i is certainly the best for it is the easiest the safest and upon experience will be found to be the pleasantest also  chap clxvii at length the irksome day of trial arrived a crisis which even to the innocent or the secure must occasion great matter of perturbation my penitent did not appear to be the least disturbed at its approach she assured me that virtue and religion had even within so short an interval so perfectly calmed every passion in her mind that she was very certain had not the prosecution been purchased off i should have seen her upon this occasion rather more composed than she confessed she was at the present for she owned that there lay one concern heavy on her mind now which she would not much have attended to then this was her being exposed a public spectacle in a court upon an indictment for so mean a crime  this thought pleased me extremely it gave me assurance of her virtue modesty is the great bulwark of that sex and the surest sign of a returning grace in them is its being accompanied with a sense of shame i was resolved therefore to extricate her from this difficulty and immediately calling in the jailer i told him how the case stood with regard to his prisoner that there was to be no manner of prosecution and therefore as there was nothing more than mere matter of form to pass through i would give him ten guineas to procure any ordinary woman to stand in the dock and hold up her hand at the bar in this ladys name  the money tempted him he stepped out of the room and returning back again in about five minutes told us he had bribed his own maidservant to put on her ridinghood and act the culprit part for the prisoner but at the same time he insisted upon locking the lady up safe lest the prosecution might unexpectedly go on and he be obliged then to plead a mistake and produce the real person whose name was upon his calendar  we submitted to this caution and i consented at her request to be confined along with her having retained some eminent lawyers to attend the trial and placed mr seawell as a guard upon the jew when we were left alone tears burst from her eyes and turning them to me you cannot bear acknowledgements said she therefore i shall only still continue to oblige by asking further favors from you will you then in this sad scene and at this dread hour join your voice with mine in fervent prayer i kneeled down by her at the word and we both continued in that posture till we heard the door unlocked when mr seawell came running into the room to wish her joy  she behaved with her new temper upon this occasion and with a composed countenance and steady voice replied i heartily thank my friends both for their kindness and generous assistance during my distress but o far above all do i acknowledge my eternal obligations to the most highest for his infinite goodness and mercy in having thus tried and proved me by this happy affliction  we immediately took coach and went off together to leadenhallstreet where we found mrs seawell in the fondest anxiety and impatience as she expressed herself to receive her dear friend safe into her arms and both she and i had already set forth the reformation of the divorcee in such a light that mr seawell was prevailed upon at my request to accept of her as a lodger in his house again  i staid to dine with them in the evening the two ladies went to prayers and at their return i read amana to them a new dramatic poem which had been just published that day they appeared to be both charmed with the spirit style and sentiments of the writing and said they were flattered by it also as it was written by a woman  we supped together and when i was taking my leave i paid the reclaimed divorcee all due compliments upon her proper sense and merit on the late occasion and concluded with this injunction to the rest that on account of this consideration no part of her past conduct or private history should ever be repeated out of our little society nor even remembered in it the seawells made a solemn vow of confidence to the purport of my proposition and i retired leaving the retrieved fair dissolved in tears of tenderest gratitude  chap clxviii i returned home with the most exulting heart imaginable i had rescued one woman and prevented another from ruin so far well  for them but for myself i had another woman more precious than the whole sex besides still to recover this acquisition was necessary to confirm my virtue and complete my happiness at the same time  but where to find her  by what clue to trace her out london was neither a probable place to expect nor a possible one to search for her in and to what part of england she might have retired with her little hermes then about three years old it must have been impossible for me even to have guessed  the next morning i sent a card to leadenhallstreet to inquire how the ladies did but did not pay them a visit for several days which i passed retired in my chambers in a very lowspirited way arising from the despondent reflection just mentioned praying and hoping that either her friendship for me or natural curiosity at least to know what scheme or course of life i was pursuing or some lucky accident or other might restore me to the happiness of seeing her once more and resolving upon a trust in this fond hope to hold both my heart and hand at liberty to dedicate to her  the last evening of my retirement mr seawell called to see me he told me that his ladies had gone to morning and evening prayers at six and six every day since we parted and that his wife had objected to the early service at first but had been persuaded to it by her friend as answering a double purpose at once both of health and devotion he added that he owed great obligations to this extraordinary woman who kept his wife almost constantly in her company read to her and endeavored all in her power to improve her mind and regulate her conduct  he concluded his visit with telling me that the ladies were much surprised at my long absence and had sent him to inquire whether any accident or disgust had happened to deprive them the pleasure of my company i returned my compliments to the fair querists and assured him that i had purposed to wait upon upon them the next morning before he had called upon me  chap clxix the day following i went to leadenhallstreet about twelve oclock and after a few minutes conversation with mr and mrs seawell below stairs i walked up to pay a visit to my now esteemed friend who received me with great cheerfulness in her manner and pleasure in her looks  she asked me in a friendly way why i had absented myself so long from friends who had so wellgrounded an esteem for me but i recollect your delicacy said she you were afraid of acknowledgements and knowing the world tolerably well might very justly have concluded that a few days interval would have supplied a bumper of lethe to obligation no mr carewe added she though my speech may be condemned to silence my actions shall ever bear an higher testimony of my gratitude toward you  i hope continued she with a smile that my behavior for some time past may not be understood as any contradiction to my present professions but the innocent yet frail mrs seawell has heartily confessed her weakness with regard to you she has translated to me all your french conversations together and has owned the dangerous preference which it was too natural for a young galant to have obtained over an old husband  but my exhortations my remonstrances said she with the prevalence of my own sad example who with  i may without presumption add  better sense and less temptation to err had merely through indiscretion been led from one step to another into the very gulf of destruction have been so strongly urged by me as a warning to her conduct that i think i may as far as female sincerity can be depended upon give assurance of her conduct for the future  to this i replied in the same style with which she had accosted me that she had infringed one article of her covenant for so far from restraining her speech she had testified her obligations to me in the highest manner in thus employing it to cooperate by her advice and counsel with my own honest intentions toward the person she mentioned and if the lady has done me justice added i you must be already convinced of this assertion from my conversation and manners with regard to her for some time past  i must confess she replied that my friend has not made me a confidant in this particular you are not to expect such ingenuousness in our sex  and to tell you the truth said she i think it would not be prudent in either of us to take any notice of it to her women are naturally weak and vain and it is the best philosophy always to oppose these foibles against each other now should her virtue appear to have arisen from any other principle but her own native force believe me it would much weaken the incitement to it  just at this instant the door opened and a lovely boy of about eight years of age walked into the room  she looked she doubted  she blushed she started  then giving a loud shriek sprang forward caught him up in her arms and would have stifled him with her embrace if a most beautiful girl about a year younger had not appeared immediately after  she let her son drop and had not power to advance toward her daughter  but when her husband entered the room she swooned away on the floor before he could run up to sustain her  the scene was beyond my powers  i ran instantly down stairs to rejoice with my friends below upon this happy event which i had already prepared them for  chap clxx you were kinder to them than you have been to us interrupted mr andrews and beville with one voice for this was indeed a crisis which no part of your recital could in any manner have warned us of i was so impatient to obtain this favorite point replied mr carewe that i neglected the usual course of narrative to arrive at it the story in short is this  when i perceived the fair penitent rising into virtue by such degrees as gave assurance of stability her repentance her resignation her grateful sentiments of her obligations to her husband her reflection about her children her sense of shame and finally the receiving and rejoicing in her affliction as a mercy and a blessing from the hands of providence i thought her now become a fit object for the most interesting connections of life either as a friend a mother or a wife  upon this not unphilosophic sentiment i wrote a letter to her husband the very night of her acquittal saying that i had something to communicate to him of consequence to his children and himself and requesting the favor of him to bring them up to london immediately for that i should not explain myself any farther by letter curiosity hurried him up express and the morning before i carried him to leadenhallstreet he came to my apartments in the temple  i then told him that the business i had summoned him about was to acquaint him with an event which must naturally afford the extremest satisfaction to an humane mind namely the most complete reformation in his wife both in mind and manners that ever grace had yet vouchsafed to a sinner  i then gave him an account of her behavior and expressions since her arrest as far as i could do so without revealing any part of her story which would have been to her disadvantage but affected to speak of her amendment as commencing immediately upon the separation  i said that her actions and conduct had now ceased to be a scandal to her husband or a reproach to her children and that her sense and virtue were sufficient to recommend her at present both as a companion to the one and a guide to the other for my part said i were she free and my own heart disingaged from the thorough conviction i have conceived of her firmness in morals and religion i should not have the least manner of scruple about accepting her myself into the nicest and most honorable connections of life regarding her former vice and errors be they what they may but as the spots of pestilence or deliriums of a fever unimputable now to her restored health and reason  then said i taking hold of him by the hand whom heaven has forgiven let not man forsake receive her dear sir again into your favor and protection at once to reward and to confirm her virtue and be assured that you will find the exercise of this kindness this charity this humanity most extremely pleasing on the experiment for perhaps there may be few things more grateful to a generous mind than to have something to forgive  i perceived the workings of his mind rising by degrees and aiding my purpose still as i went on but when i came to this last expression he burst silence with these words forgive said he and leaning his hand upon my shoulder i have alas nothing to forgive my crime has been greater than here is even supposing her to have been guilty and we have nothing now to do but to commute forgiveness and as i hope that my contrition has already earned full pardon for my sin we meet now upon equal terms of penitence  why not then of love o lead me to her thou excellent young man that i may show the strength of that passion with which i first embraced her by its subsisting still in force after a separation of three years and one so strongly marked as ours  i listened with pleasure and embraced him with transport  i then appointed the next morning for the completion of their reunion and told him that i would not suffer her to receive the least notice of her approaching happiness in order to have their meeting as strongly marked as was their parting  chap clxxi i sat below with mrs seawell who was praising and blessing me for my goodness till dinner was served when i went up stairs to summon this little happy united family i embraced them all not without tears and taking her by the hand led her down into the parlour  the remainder of that day passed off in the pleasantest manner imaginable to us all  but the exultations of my mind upon this occasion are not to be expressed your own virtue gentlemen must conceive them the behavior of the reconciled pair to each other so polite so attentive and so fond each striving to prevent the other in shows of love and mutual amity   the next morning early they left london and returned to their own seat in the country where they have lived in perfect harmony together ever since as frequent letters and pressing invitations from them both have happily informed me i have never yet paid them a visit  their desiring one pleased me because it showed the true humility of virtue but my nicety prevented me because persons be their reformation ever so sincere can never enjoy perfect ease or freedom in company with those who have once had certain knowledge of their vices  chap clxxii having now rid my mind of all difficulties with regard to others my own uneasiness pressed more heavily upon me i owed a treble obligation to honor to virtue and to love but was deprived of the charming means of acquitting myself to them all at once reflection upon this scheme the more confirmed my purpose and disappointment augmented still my ardour  i helped to relieve my spirits by reading and seeing the fair seawell often at her own house or by invitation with her husband at my chambers and our behavior toward each other was ever perfectly polite and platonic we used all the freedom of a brother and sister together preserving at the same time the purest innocence of such correlatives  in this situation had i continued for some time when one evening i received this letter by the pennypost gentlemen said mr carewe taking out his pocketbook and presenting them with a paper to read the contents of which were in the following words sir as you may be deemed in some sort accountable for my conduct in life perhaps it may pass for a kind of duty in me to acquaint you with every particular of it since we last parted a faithful relation of which shall be the subject of this letter  as soon as i had taken my degree at oxford i struck my name out of the books and returned home to my grandfathers he was rejoiced to see me said a great many fond and flattering things to me and pressed me several times in his arms i felt myself extremely unhappy on this interview as his kindnesses appeared so much unmerited on my part first from the equivocation of my sex and next from that ultimate misfortune which had rendered me so very unworthy of my real one  he told me that he hoped i had come home with a resolution of remaining with him during the short remnant of his life and i had indeed really purposed to do so but i soon found it very disagreeable and sometimes inconvenient to myself to live entirely in his house  he was too fond of my company and never afforded me the least opportunity for reading or reflection except the few hours which i used to steal to myself in the mornings by rising so much earlier than he and during the short siestos or evening naps he took every day after dinner  i loved him for his goodnature i respected him for his virtues and i honored him as a parent  but notwithstanding these regards his conversation soon became tedious to me he would tell old stories and his memory or fresh topics failing him would repeat them over again he would also tire me with asking a number of frivolous questions which one moments reflection might have either answered to himself or shown him the insignificancy of but this is after the manner of old people who find it easier to talk than think  there were some other particulars which rendered my abode with him difficult and uneasy to me he lived hospitably and saw more company than was agreeable either to my inclinations or circumstances he would be sometimes peevish if i did not drink a bottle with my friends  who cared not whether i was drunk or sick with it or no  and that i would not dishonor myself to do the honors of his house  when young ladies happened to be of the company he would distress me greatly by pressing me to exert my galantries toward them i used sometimes to attempt it in complaisance to him but my address was always too much embarrassed i could neither assume the assurance of my apparent character nor divest myself of the bashfulness of my real one and this aukwardness appeared so very ridiculous that it has frequently set the girls a laughing at me  but there was one difficulty which distressed me more than any of the rest when his house was crowded with guests at nights he would desire me to offer share of my bed to some of the jolly foxhunters of the company the first time that this happened i feigned a sudden illness as soon as the old colonel had retired and sat up taking an emetic till the early horn sounded which summoned my chum to the chase and left me the bed to myself a second time upon foreseeing the like circumstance i pretended a vast impatience of paying my duty to my aunt and accordingly ordered the postchaise and drove off to her house immediately after dinner  upon a consideration of all these circumstances i resolved to retreat somewhere or other where i might pass my life in a manner more retired and agreeable to myself and to my real character i told the good old man that i required the conversation and assistance of some eminent divines to settle my orthodoxy that i had a mind to see a little more of the world before i sequestered myself from it and that therefore i should be infinitely obliged to him if he would let me have the portion he had been so good as to allot me and suffer me to seek my fortunes in the world at large  this most excellent parent received my proposal with regret but after some pause thou have so much sense and virtue he was so kind to say that i do not think i shall fail in the duty of a guardian in trusting you with your own conduct in life and as to the portion you have chosen to stint yourself to  remember it was all your own doing  i think do you mind that you have been too fair a purchaser to have that little modicum withheld from you upon demand  so god bless you boy  you will come do you hear and see your old father often god almighty guide and protect my child  the next morning he gave me an order on his banker for four thousand pounds and opening his bureau made me a present of two hundred guineas also we both of us wept sincerely and the next day i borrowed his equipage to set me down in london i placed the four thousand pounds along with the same sum which you had been so generous as to remit to me at oxford in the funds i hired a small house there and sent for my nurse and fosterfather to come up and attend me in it  my reason for selecting these two persons was that as she was the only confidant of my metamorphose from whom i apprehended any discovery i thought it prudent to retain her both in my friendship and my service and as her husband was a very rational discreet man who had been my fathers parishclerk had kept a latin school in the village was a good christian and tolerably well read in morality and history i thought he might be useful toward assisting me in the first parts of my dear childs education whom at the proper age for beginning instruction i have since brought home to me  i shall here ask pardon of you for this theft but fearing lest you might not have had the generosity to bestow him to me had i made the request and being likewise offended at the apprehension of his ever coming to discover what kind of relationship he bears to you i ventured to steal him from you besides what is at present my sole happiness might have been perhaps rather an encumbrance to you he is lovely lively healthy and intelligent i will be responsible for his education and morals  my reason for choosing london as an asylum from the world was that i thought i might live there more disingaged and unknown than i could possibly have done in any village or countryseat in england one is best hid in a crowd another inducement to this choice was that i might sometimes enjoy the pleasure though an uneasy one of seeing you at a distance of attending to your conduct of watching over you like a guardianangel unseen and of doing you perhaps some little friendly offices which your too giddy and dissipated life might possibly sooner or later afford me an opportunity of exerting toward you  i have seen you often at church and at the play and having directed some private inquiries about your conduct character and manner of life i was informed that you had prepared a most expensive habit to appear in at the first masquerade of last season which dress i received a particular description of  i was struck with the whim of seeing you and this fantastic scene together i went there dressed in a domino the rest of that nights adventure perhaps may occur to your own recollection now i employed my fosterfather to carry on the masquerade with you the next morning and twice since by personating a merchants clerk  i had determined to have remained in london quite disingaged from any manner of connection suffering our dear son to pass for my ward till he should be fit to enter into college when i purposed to carry him to cambridge and reside with him there but some expressions which you happened to let drop the last morning my agent was with you have quite altered my scheme of life you hinted with a fond sigh that you were then in pursuit of love and matrimony may all the success and happiness that your merit shall entitle you to attend you in every engagement and connection of life to wish more were impious   but notwithstanding the sincerity of this prayer notwithstanding the religion the philosophy and the resignation with which i flattered myself that i had sufficiently armed my mind i find i cannot  i confess my weakness  think of remaining in the same city or even in the same kingdom with you after such an event some unlucky chance might possibly hereafter occasion you and i to meet  and i would spare us both the difficulty and disturbance of such an interview  i deferred sending you this letter which has been written for some time till i was on shipboard where i am at present  whither bound no matter  may prosperous gales breathe on us both amen and adieu  domino     chap clxxiii what must have been my situation when i had come to the conclusion of this letter what a fate had befallen me that those very expressions of love and honor which the overflowings of my fond heart had occasionally poured out toward herself should have been the sole cause of her being banished from my hopes for ever i began to grow superstitious and dread lest some evil contingency might possibly have been interwoven with my destiny and fell into a kind of despondency and despair which i continued under for some days  at length i was roused out of my reverie by mr seawells calling on me one morning and showing me an invitation to spend some days in the country which had been addressed to him his wife and to me from the gentleman mentioned before with whom i had dined one day in leadenhallstreet and who lived about five miles from london  it was about the middle of may and the weather fine i thought that company and country air might assist me to relieve my spirits and at least alleviate in some sort my present disappointment i accordingly accepted of the invitation and the next morning took a coach called on my two friends and drove down to the country with a design of spending a week there together  our host entertained us with great cheerfulness and hospitality but finding that wine rather depressed than raised my spirits i retired to the ladies soon after dinner  i drank a dish of coffee with them and perceiving that my melancholy damped the spirit of their conversation i stole out of the room and went to saunter in the gardens alone  i had walked there about half an hour when crossing one of the alleys i met mrs seawell who told me she had made some pretense to quit her company and had followed me into the garden out of a friendly curiosity and concern to inquire what sudden or extraordinary misfortune had affected me so very remarkably the whole day both in looks appetite and manners  when the mind is full and the heart softened solicitation and sympathy are apt to induce a confidence it is a relief besides to the oerburdened soul to find a friendly prop to rest its load upon and in love peculiarly it is some solace even to make the object of our affections a subject of our conversation i treated her then to the little novel see her own expression chap clxiii parag   of my amor but with such reserve as still preserved both the ladys character and secret  i told her that i had formerly paid my addresses to a very amiable young lady without any design but general galantry that i had happened unluckily to have won her heart before i perceived that i had lost my own that after i had parted from her and passed through some dangerous and extravagant scenes of idle and debauched life i found that my attachments had been already fixed upon this dear object without my own consciousness of the matter that upon this conviction i had gone to search for her at her former residence and upon missing and not being able to gather any account of her or her family there i had been in quest of her ever since in vain  i then concluded my story with telling her that about a week past i had received a letter from this lady dated from on shipboard and taking leave of me for life i added also the circumstance which had through mistake been the unlucky occasion of our ultimate separation i stopped i sighed and shed a tear  she took me by the hand pressed it and dropped a tear also through all her features was strongly marked the charming morbidezza or tender languish she wished herself the happy fair or that fortune might throw it in her way to discover and present her to my arms  chap clxxiv this conversation had led us a considerable distance from the house when happening to pass by an apiary just as one of the hives began to swarm she started at the hum and sprang over a border into the opposite alley but on her alighting at the other side she had missed her footing and fell quite prostrate on the grasswalk doing herself at the same time an accidental piece of justice by revealing the most beautiful limbs even above her garters that i had ever yet beheld  i walked over the border to her assistance pleased though surprised at her remaining motionless on the ground in such a posture and deshabille as if waiting till i should come to raise her up but it seemed that she had sprained her left ancle and wrenched both her wrists which had rendered her quite unable to stir without assistance  i took her in my arms and carried her out of the sun into a little green arbor that i spied at some paces off where i set her down on the grass as there was neither chair or bench in the place she moaned greatly through pain and both her hands being disabled she could not rub or foment her leg herself but perceiving the ancle beginning to swell i kneeled down before her and performed that piece of surgery for her as we were too far from the house to provide her with more decent assistance  i kept down the swelling and by degrees she found herself able to move her ancle sufficiently to limp home she then returned me thanks for my obliging care expressed great concern at the trouble she had given me and seemed extremely impatient to be gone from that suspicious place  i gave her my hand to raise her but when she attempted to stir she was obliged to scream out from an excess of sudden pain and remained still on the ground this second distress proceeded entirely from her overscrupulous modesty for that she might expose no more of her leg than was just necessary to be chafed she had contracted the sinews of it so much that it occasioned a violent cramp in the calf of that limb  i had now an higher operation to perform upon my too lovely patient i began instantly to rub the gasterocnemium a term in anatomy for the calf of the leg  till the convulsion rising by degrees into the biceps femoris a muscle of the thigh which serves to move the leg  and the gemini vide harriss lexicon technicum  i was tempted to pursue the retreating enemy too far till at length i had fallen my self into the ambush   chap clxxv poor carewe you see ladies that he cannot peep his nose abroad but temptation and opportunity stare him full in the face but in truth he had for some time most unphysically mistaken an ague for virtue and the hot fit had now very naturally succeeded the cold one consider his situation what constitution can stand unmoved point blank under the line he had presumed too much upon his newfledged pinions  pennis non homini datis and like another icarus by soaring into the region of temptation the wax was melted before the flame of desire  the unfortunate seawell too her accident seems to have been entirely owing to her total ignorance in natural philosophy familiarity with men though upon the chastest principles imaginable is always dangerous the jockeys have a phrase that a foal well handled is half broke and the spaniards have also a proverb  that is  if you ask me i will tell you  in short take my word for it ladies those few of you who have had no experience in this matter that platonics are a mere farce it is as dull and uninteresting as hunting a drag without any quarry at the end of it they are the devils features under an angels mask in general they are but pretended in order to indulge a vice under the cloak of virtue but even where they are sincere as in innocent and unexperienced minds they sometimes may be yet let such still beware that refined passions like dried gunpowder are thereby but rendered the more susceptible of a spark and whether the flame be caught from an earthly fire or a celestial ray it equally raises the combustible to an explosion  there happened to be another science too which the fair but illiterate seawell seems to have been totally ignorant of upon this crisis namely anatomy mr carewe appears to be perfectly skilled in the muscles gasterocnemium the biceps femoris and the o gemini but the poor lady had unfortunately never learned the use of the tendon styled sartorius this is called in anatomy the taylors muscle as it is that which enables us to cross our legs  though philosophers generally agree that this same sinew was originally so weakened by the fall that it has not recovered its spring ever since  there is another piece of natural knowledge also which mr carewe hints this lady to have been most shamefully unacquainted with till then but let old seawell take it for his pains  when a person happens to have been bound apprentice to an insufficient master it cannot certainly be deemed any breach of indentures to pick up the trade from a more able instructor  chap clxxvi when we had recovered from our trance said mr carewe for such it might be truly called where we were both of us rather patients than agents she wept and trembled  i blushed and started  she immediately forgot her lameness and rushed out of the arbor i remained behind calling myself villain betrayer perfidious lover treacherous friend inhospitable guest hypocrite apostate etc not one of which vile appellations had i in reality merited for an involuntary deed of phrenzy without or purpose or reflection but such was my concern such my contrition that in my extravagance i charged myself with the seemings as with realities  i pursued her into the garden and soon overtook her laboring toward the house in pain and distraction i took hold of her hand threw myself at her feet implored her forgiveness pleaded surprise passion madness nature etc she still continued to weep and remained some time silent while i was supporting her under the arm till i led her near the house when she made use of this expression i neither blame you sir nor myself said she but wish sincerely that my death this morning had been as sudden and unexpected as your crime  the accident of her fall the marks of which became now very visible in her leg and wrists accounted for her confusion and tears and my walking off abruptly as i did to london as soon as i had seated mrs seawell in the drawing room was apologized for by her telling the company the story i had made her a confidant of in the garden and which also made an excuse for my gloomy reserve and avoidance of society all the day  i did indeed fly precipitately from the house the moment i had disingaged myself being ashamed to look some of the company in the face and afraid also of embarrassing the unfortunate fair one with my presence i pitied her and condemned myself  but there are contingencies which baffle foresight and disgrace philosophy all that is left for poor virtue to do is to repair those evils which it cannot prevent and this i was resolved to do by every possible means in my power  chap clxxvii i remained at home for about a week spending my time between musings and books often kissing and reading over my dear dominos letter till i am very certain that i could repeat every syllable of it by heart i found that i owed her eight thousand pounds which though an heavy debt gave me this satisfaction that by this means i might possibly have the happiness of soon finding her out for as it was the whole of her fortune she must be obliged to draw bills upon me for the interest and i was in hopes that i should then be able to discover the place of her residence from the date of her first advice  i thought it prudent during this avocation and leisure to look a little into my own affairs and make some calculation about my other debts and expenses and upon this inquiry had the surprise to find that besides this eight thousand pounds i owed in sundry sums each of which was too small in itself to alarm me to the amount of two thousand pounds more  thus had i the shame and mortification of reflecting that almost half my fortune had been the prey of vanity and extravagance without having purchased me any one responsible pleasure even a transitory one except the five hundred pounds which i had bestowed upon the divorcee and which will ever remain a solid and permanent one to me for all the joys i had ever yet experienced had been contingencies merely without having been either my purchase or pursuit  the cheapest thing a man can possibly do is to pay his debts and it is cheaper still to sell than borrow i applied immediately to a landjobber for this purpose and marked out a distinct portion of my estate to him which i was resolved to dispose of we soon agreed upon the terms but when he came to look into the title i was discovered to have been made but bare tenant for life with remainder over to some distant relation of the testator  this was the first knowledge i ever had received of the restriction which my fortune was tied down to my honor was extremely shocked upon this information on account of the danger to which my unfortunate creditors but principally my dear wife and child were exposed upon the precariousness of my life  i held a frequent correspondence with my dear mother during her life and had several interviews with her by her appointments at a relations house of here is about a days journey from my fathers  from her i learned that he was at this time but just entering into his fiftieth year and was of a robust hale foxhunters constitution  in these circumstances i thought it would be extremely idle in me to live on upon contingency and very dishonest too to refer my creditors to so insufficient a security i therefore for the safety of all parties immediately resolved upon a scheme of economy which i accordingly put in practice the very next day  i found that though i had been made tenant for life by the will yet i was left dispunishable for waste so i disposed of my woods to a person who had been in treaty with me for them upon my advertisement for the sum of five thousand pounds i might perhaps have raised more money upon this sale had i given notice of it in the public papers but i transacted the matter clandestinely as it were lest it might possibly have come to the knowledge of my dear wife and have given her an alarm with regard to her own fortune or rendered her generous mind uneasy about mine  i laid out this money in the funds with a resolution to confine my expenses to the income of it i also vested the rents of my estate in the hands of a trustee a bencher of the inner temple and a friend of mine giving him a schedule of my debts directing principally that the interest of the eight thousand pounds should be kept sacred against all halfyearly demands and three thousand pounds of the principal provided for likewise out of the first receipts the woodmoney being deposited as a security for the remainder and that the rest of my creditors should be paid off in course with a preference still in favor of the most needy  chap clxxviii one morning about a fortnight after my adventure in the arbor as i was reading in my chambers mr seawell came into the room after a very abrupt manner shut the door hastily and turning the bolt of the lock you will excuse my manners sir said he but my business with you at present requires privacy  he appeared to be much disturbed and you must imagine gentlemen said mr carewe that i could not have been perfectly at ease myself upon this extraordinary interview o what a powerful thing is guilt that spirit of youth and nature which but a minute before dared have braved a lion now trembled at a man  this affair my dear andrews said he had like to have ended very fatally both to you and me for it was that very five hundred pounds which the unfortunate mans difficulties then called upon me to join him in a bond for that some time after involved your generosity in so much distress and danger but this relief happened not to be at all effectual to the poor man for his disappointments and losses in trade fell so quick upon him that he was obliged to quit the kingdom soon after and absconded with his wife into holland  when the honest man found that he could not stand his ground he sent me private notice to lay on an execution in order to secure myself in a debt which he had contracted solely with a view of preserving his credit on the change i did as he directed and received the five hundred pounds upon the sale of his effects  the next day i paid a visit to the jew merchant already spoken of and deposited this sum in his hands with directions to remit it over to his friend in holland as a support to these poor unhappy fugitives he executed this commission with punctuality and i had the satisfaction some time after to hear that by this help joined to the assistance of some dutch merchants who had been his correspondents at london he had been enabled to establish himself very comfortably in trade again at amsterdam  this debt now becoming my own i immediately added to the schedule which i had already given in to my trustee  chap clxxix having now prudently contracted my expenses to the bare interest of five thousand pounds i thought it proper to quit the temple and retire from among a set of cotemporaries with whom i had been used to spend a much larger income  i took lodgings at a milliners a widow in london and kept myself pretty much retired there seldom stirring abroad except to sup now and then with my friend and trustee or sometimes spending a night or two with him at a little villa he had near town  some evenings when i happened to be tired of reading or not in a fit disposition of mind to sit down to it i would invite my landlady and her daughter up stairs to drink tea or sup with me the mother used to entertain me with mistaking one word for another that had a similar sound and would really have been a treasure to fielding when he was drawing the character of his slipslop  her daughter was young handsome and forward the mother would frequently leave us together when she was called down stairs about the business of her shop these are hazardous experiments i had before experienced male chastity to be a jest and am apt to believe too that opportunity is generally an overmatch for female virtue also the parthian exercise is their best discipline an happy expression made use of by the lady who translated the memoirs and writings of ninon de lenclos  this adventure soon added another five hundred pounds to my schedule  a batchelors life who has any principles of honor is a very awkward and distressing one i have often wished that philosophy could point out some way or other to reconcile morals with nature and strike every thing out of the catalogue of vices which is not entered in the list of reason i would marry but could not the person upon whom my virtue and affections had been fixed was snatched from my arms and while even the most distant hope of recovering her remained it would have been dishonorable in me to have entered into engagements with any other woman quoi fair donc  it was here i lodged my dear andrews said mr carewe when your bravery and generosity rescued me on ludgate hill and from the day of our parting at islington i retired into the country of england without remaining long in any one place in order to avoid fixing my affections on any woman who might during the uncertain and fluctuating state of my mind have possibly attached them too much either for my honor or repose  the interval of my life between that day and this continued mr carewe has been chiefly employed in reading or amused with a very few desultory adventures without connection or consequence and therefore not worth relating excepting one which being equally whimsical and ridiculous i shall entertain you with at present  chap clxxx hold mr carewe  you see reader that he is at one of his short catches here again see chap cxlvi parag    just touch and go  give you hints and then leave you to guess perhaps he scorned to descend into a detail of mrs bensons bons mots before the refined messieurs andrews and beville and to say the truth i should be as nice myself were i to perform before such audiences only but pit box and gallery must be regarded nowadays by every writer who honestly means to pay his bookseller see preface parag     besides you may see by the list of my subscribers what a farrago of readers i am bound down to and i am now going to fulfill my engagements to the last class of them  i knew this mrs benson extremely well and have spent many an hour with the mother below stairs for the mere pleasure of hearing her knock words out of joint while charles carewe perhaps was spelling and putting together with the daughter above stairs i did not know mr carewe at that time and only visited mrs benson in order to complete a slipslop dictionary i was then framing which i have since completed and shall be soon published for the benefit of the many persons who are apt to catch words by ear and repeat them by rote without knowing either the meaning or derivation of them  in this very useful dictionary it may be necessary in order to prevent mistakes to acquaint the belles and beaus that the wrong word is placed first and the right word opposite to it as for example digest  digest ingenious for sincere ingenuous male joined with ocean main twilight for a dressingtable toilet concubine for a quilt counterpane metrolopus  metropolis separation for the ripening of a wound suppuration regiment for health regimen crazy for lunatic crazed cruds  curds cleopatra for the doxology gloria patri harpsicol  harpsichord dissolute for lonely desolate contagious for proximity contiguous immediantly  immediately sermont  sermon laudable for loud audible cockgetting  coquetting and so forth but to return to mother benson  she complained to me one day that a woman in the neighborhood upon some quarrel that happened between them had given her very unproarious language  another time she expressed great pity for a poor gentleman who lived over the way because his fortune she said was much produced of late  i was going to norwich once and she advised me to set up at a particular inn which she had been well entertained at because she said i might depend on good commendation there  she asked my advice one day about a lawsuit she was going to commence on her brothers dying attested  she missed some tea and sugar one morning and calling her maid to account for it said she would forgive her if she would own the truth for that open confusion was good for the soul  speaking once of two young women of her acquaintance who were sisters pray observe said she the difference of natures in the same family and under the very same education too there is sally now imports herself with perfect modesty and that vile nancy has turned out an arrant proselyte  but to return again to my dictionary  i dare say that this work cannot fail of encouragement in such a dictionary age as the present to what sublimated pitch of learning have some of our great chemists in literature arrived in the current century who deal out science in essence without the difficulty of study as empirics do health in phials without the restraint of regimen both of which quintessences of refinement may be well compared to our late invented spring postchaises which so expeditiously convey the modern youth of britain from stage to stage without the fatigue of exercise but the dictionary library must still remain imperfect till the publication of my slipslop expositor for the rest only teach you what you are to say but this will inform you also what you are not to say which is absolutely necessary to render the circle of arts and sciences full and complete  chap clxxxi in one of the villages where i lodged said mr carewe i happened to become acquainted with a gentleman in the neighborhood by his dining sometimes with my landlord with whom i boarded he had great fund of entertainment in him not indeed derived from any extraordinary sense wit or learning but he was an humourist had a peculiar cast of character and was what the french style un diseur des bons mots but seasoned high with sarcasm which rendered him at once the delight and terror of all his acquaintance for he was very free of speech and his descriptions of the principal personages male and female of that country which he usually made the topics of his conversation were doubly pointed both critical and severe  one evening he invited me along with a good deal of company to supper at his house his wife was a pretty kind of woman handsome lively goodhumoured and about thirty years of age he was himself an hale man somewhat above forty they had been just seven years married that day without ever having had a child or the least alarm about one  we spent the night very cheerfully and agreeably together some in dancing and others in playing cards till supper was served which was a very elegant one in honor as he told us of his wedding day about twelve oclock the company divided the ladies retired upstairs with his wife and the men staid below with our landlord to finish what wine was upon the table and to escort the ladies home  in about a quarter of an hour a bell was rung and our host immediately rising up from his chair gentlemen said he ye were most of you present this very night seven years at the ceremony of throwing the stocking and i have invited you all this evening in order to be spectators of a rite which i design to introduce of casting the nightcap we smiled at the expression though without thoroughly comprehending the meaning of it and followed him up stairs into his wifes apartment  we found her in bed with the rest of the ladies standing round it as soon as her husband entered the room he took up his nightcap which had been placed upon his own pillow and with an audible voice repeated the following lines vainly i have in the vineyard plied seven years of fruitless love have tried an hard apprenticeship alack when ever it is served the trade grows slack with equal wish though toiled my dame loves labor lost was all our game what folly twere then to repeat it so thus i cast my nightcap at it   when he had finished his rhimes he raised up the clothes with one hand and with the other slung his brown beaver into the middle of the bed the whole company laughed heartily and seemed highly pleased with the humor for my part i confess that i could not much relish the indecency of the action in itself though his being a sort of privileged person and this frolic a stroke in character did in some measure take off a good deal from the impropriety of it  when i was taking my leave i stooped down and saluted the fair prostrate then turning about to the husband issue sir said i is more the gift of providence than of nature and those from whom this blessing is withheld would do well to think that in the dispensations of heaven some parents may be left without children because some children are left destitute of parents  he seemed to be struck with my expression your hint shall not be thrown away upon me replied he we shook hands and parted in a few days after i had the pleasure to hear that he had adopted two orphans in the parish a boy and a girl whom he clothed and put to school with a declared and provided purpose of apprenticing and portioning them hereafter  chap clxxxii this mr carewe seems really to be a most excellent young man you will pardon him ladies the few snacks of wenching he takes now and then as you see that this is not his purpose and that he would do better if he could his sentiment in this place is extremely beautiful the reflection is fine and the thought entirely new but in truth it were a shame if a christian had not been able to have expressed himself in such a manner when a pagan epictetus was capable of saying that there were no orphans for jupiter the parent of mankind lives for ever  i wish i could persuade your old maids to pick up a little moral out of this sentiment of mr carewe it would be much better for their poor souls than peevishness envy and scandal it might possibly also recommend them sometimes to widowers and after they were past the hopes of being ever made mothers themselves give them a chance of becoming stepmothers to others at least  where women of this class in life happen to be well disposed they may frequently be very useful members of society for having no connections or vocations of their own they might be ready upon occasion to supply the places of those who had insomuch that i really think no large family in the country can well be without one or two familiars or ledcousins of this sort who should be maintained at the subscriptional expense of all their married male relations to the third degree inclusive  and in towns i would have one two or or three women past their teemings established in every parish according to the size of it who should be ready to be summoned in aid to prevent husbands from gandering away their health and squandering their substance when wives lie in and when they die to take upon them the government of the house and family in order to keep widowers from injuring their children by second marriages  these succedaneums to matrimony should be always lodged at the apothecarys ready to be administered as occasion may require and ought to be supported by a parish cess to be levied along with the poorhouse rates and watchmoney and with regard to the moral of the matter in polity as well as war may it not be sometimes necessary to appoint des enfans perdues or a forlornhope to be sacrificed for the good of the community  i think proper in this place to explain and vindicate myself upon a passage in my subscriptionlist where i make a distinction between old maids and old virgins which it seems has given great offense to a very respectable society as i have been informed by a letter i received lately from a lady who styles herself president to an academy of old maidens in the city and who concludes her epistle in these words it is very hard truly sir that you will not allow us even the virtue of necessity nor leave us the merit of chastity to make us some small amends for the mortification of it  but these ladies have misapprehended me greatly if they imagine that i meant to cast any manner of reflection upon their purity by this distinction  far from it but my philosophy about the matter is really this let maidens guard their virginity ever so vigilantly from man that sly slow ravisher which besieges them both night and day time will at length steal it imperceptibly away in despite of chastity even while they are at their last prayers or wrangling at quadrille  for virginity like other flowers though you should not pluck it falls off itself when ripe leaving a dry and sterile stalk behind it milton says it withers on the stalk with languishd head and shakespeare but earthlier happier is the rose distilled than that which withering on the virgin thorn grows lives and dies in single blessedness so that old maids be they never so chaste cannot with any manner of propriety be styled virgins  but the haums of virginity only  old maids and batchelors may be compared to rampikes which remain solitary in the woodland after their fellows have been made into utensils for the use and services of society  chap clxxxiii i passed the tedious interval since our parting in this sort of vagrant life in the country of england except several halfyearly excursions which i took to france italy germany and holland in pursuit of my dear domino upon receiving her bills from any of those places but all my search was vain for it seems she had provided herself with a letter of credit upon going abroad by depositing my bonds in the hands of her banker which enabled her to receive value for her bill at the time of signing it however she never did this till she was just setting out upon her purposed tour and i found it impossible to trace her course by any inquiries i could make at her bankers or even at her lodgings which i had sometimes hit upon  about a month ago i was summoned up to london upon the death of my worthy friend and trustee in order to settle accounts with his executor and to transfer the trust just as i had finished this business i received a foreign letter directed to my former apartments at the temple  i knew the hand kissed it and trembled but when i turned it about to tear open the seal finding the wax black and the edges of the paper mourning my heart gave one loud throb and ceased all motion my stomach grew instantly sick and my voice was just able to falter out my hermes is no more  in this opinion i was but too much confirmed after i had had resolution enough to open the letter by seeing at the top of it an order to her banker to cancel my first bond of four thousand pounds which was the very provision i had allotted as a portion for my dear child  the letter dropped from my hands and i walked about the room for some time before i had power to take it up again for to the loss of my son upon whose honors was built my whole ambition was added the despair of ever recovering his dear mother again all tender all natural all virtuous connection thus at once cut off  mr carewe then presented the letter to mr andrews who read as follows  sir i take the liberty of returning you the portion you had conferred upon our dear hermes as he has now no longer any occasion for your maintenance and that perhaps it may at present be necessary to your own  my life has been pursued by losses and misfortunes since i left england last year my dear grandfather died of the gout in his stomach and about a month ago my gallant cousin who had by his bravery raised himself to the rank of major was killed in the late action in germany i have most sincerely lamented their deaths though an estate of two thousand pounds a year has by these losses devolved to me  i shall continue the same course of life i have hitherto pursued abroad by spending my time in reading prayer and travel i shall never love again for your sake nor marry for my own i have however at length brought my mind to be able to think of you without perturbation though not without regret and thanks to religion have now the power of subscribing myself my still too dear abelard yours eloisa  but without her conflicts  our charming hermes continues to improve in every amiable quality of face person sense and disposition his fondness and attention toward me surpass those of a child for ignorant as he is of my being his parent even his young mind seems already to impute an higher merit than duty to my love and attachment toward him  adieu  the last part of this letter said mr carewe revived my spirits it cancelled my fears indeed but the former part of it had before bereft me of my hopes i lamented my forlorn condition i considered myself as her husband or rather her mournful widower and put on black for her relations as if they had been my own at the same time i directed one thousand pounds out of my adventitious fortune to be given to the trustees for the magdalenhouse in aid of that great and twofold charity toward both soul and body  the very day i got to london i had inquired for you my dear friend at your house said he to mr andrews and being there referred to your attorney had the satisfaction of hearing that you were settled in this country and the moment i had finished my business in town i flew down hither to throw myself into the arms of friendship and philosophy with a determined purpose of taking some lodge near you and spending the remainder of my days in study contemplation resignation and retirement  chap clxxxiv mr andrews and mr beville were extremely charmed and entertained with mr carewes account of himself the adventures he had related both of his own and those of others were uncommon interesting and extraordinary and the generous and virtuous tenor of conduct he had preserved throughout though interrupted now and then by the natural lapses of human frailty had stamped a character for him as perfect i am afraid as flesh male flesh at least is capable of  they highly approved and commended the honor and virtue of his design in marrying the most amiable and excellent eloisa and joined cordially in condoling with him on account of the unlucky disappointments he had met with in so honest and proper a pursuit they rejoiced extremely at his purpose of taking a house in their neighborhood and that declaration had now rendered this friendly triumvirate as happy as it was possible for them to be in their present respective circumstances  they lived together in perfect harmony at the farm during the remainder of the summer but there was one particular with regard to mr carewe that puzzled and surprised his two friends extremely he had related his memoirs to them with all the appearance of frankness and confidence imaginable so as that no person who had heard him could possibly have suspected that any one secret or anecdote even of the most trifling consequence had still remained behind and yet they had seen him frequently receive letters the superscription a sair and female hand which he never communicated the least of to either of them and whatever answers he wrote he always used the reserve of carrying to the post office himself  there was another circumstance with regard to this correspondence that joined to raise their surprise still higher which was that these letters were written on mourning paper and sealed with black wax this particular inclined them to suspect that they had come from the fair fugitive or mistaken exile and what further article relative to her need now remain a mystery between them was both their curiosity and wonder however it was too delicate a point to touch upon  we have no right over other peoples secrets so let this continue one till he may himself think proper to reveal it  the three friends remained together on these terms till about the middle of september when mr carewe on the receipt of one of these uncommunicated epistles told mr andrews that he should be obliged to take leave of him for a short time upon business of some consequence which was not then ripe enough to communicate with his good friends at the farm  mr beville who was present joined with mr andrews in wishing him a good journey a successful event to his new adventure and a quick return into his present society mr carewe thanked them and appeared for the rest of that day more cheerful and disengaged in his conversation and manners than he had been at any time during his residence among them the next morning he rose before day and rode off from the farm without disturbing his friends  chap clxxxv about a fortnight after their separation mr andrews received the following most extraordinary letter from mr carewe dated from condisciplehall  my dear friend after so unreserved and voluntary a relation of the various incidents of my life it must certainly appear a great instance of disingenuousness in me to have secreted any one particular of my private history from you but your having mentioned the name of ethelinda with mr bevills unfortunate passion for her was the reason of my not informing you sooner that my connections with that lady were of a much ealier date than his acquaintance with her  i happened to be out of the kingdom when she was married she too easily submitted to the arbitrary commands of a father and yielded to duty without approbation or choice i became acquainted with this misfortune time enough only to lament but not prevent the too discordant union  she was however soon released from her heavy bondage for your friend died in a few days after your departure from hence of the disorder you had left him laboring under last christmas and leaving her a childless widow has in consideration of her merit and behavior toward him endowed her with his whole fortune amounting to fifteen hundred pounds a year  i shall not detain you longer on a subject which must be extremely uneasy to mr beville consequently to you and am in haste to inform you that in a sort of clandestine correspondence which i held with this lady while i was at your house i have had the fortune to prevail on her to adventure upon the state of matrimony again and i must now beg leave to entreat the pleasure of yours and mr bevilles company to spend the honeymoon with us at this place from the beginning of next month i should not have had the presumption to make this request if the fair ethelinda did not join me in it ye were both present at her first marriage at anothers fuit and ye are now invited to her second at her own  let not my sincerity be at all impeached upon this occasion i do still love the dear eloisa with all that warmth of passion i have so lately expressed before you and declare that were she within my grasp i would this instant kneel down with her before the altar but even hope is fled this lady then holds only the second rank in my affections  but i sincerely wish her happy and may perhaps without vanity pronounce that i have it in my power to render her so the fond lover wishes his own happiness the generous one that of his mistress this for mr beville adieu  charles carewe   chap clxxxvi mr andrews was both astonished and perplexed upon reading this letter he did not know how to reconcile the purport of it to honor nor yet could he say upon what punctilio of moral to reprehend it mr carewes having entered into an engagement with one woman while he was riding post after another his supplanting a man with whom he had appeared voluntarily to have linked himself in a league of friendship and his rivalling a real lover without even pleading passion for an excuse seemed all perfectly inconsistent with the ingenuousness and generosity of his character  and yet on the other hand might he not have engaged himself in this amor at some interval before his honor and virtue had been awakened toward the amiable eloisa might not the interposition of parents have snatched this fair one from his arms when he had just won her affections might not the despair of ever being able to recover his first object have suffered the second to take place like mercantile bills pay this my second of exchange the first not paid whenever a question can admit of a favorable construction charity should ever adopt it as in the english laws every person is supposed to be innocent till the contrary is proved  after these reflections mr andrews ventured to communicate the letter to his friend he received it like a man  with resentment and resolution he lamented his having never heard of the condisciples death till it was too late to profit of it and yet what a mortification and disappointment had he escaped by his ignorance of it he regretted his death which had afforded him at least the hope of possibility merely to shut it out for ever  he then seemed generously to rejoice in an event which had yielded his adored ethelinda so fair a prospect of happiness for life he had himself sustained no wrong had suffered no injustice the injury he had received was from fate alone and he was resolved to disappoint its malice by showing himself through resignation unworthy of the infliction  mr andrews seconded his philosophy by adding the latter part of his own reflections mentioned above in order to reconcile him to mr carewe and prevail on him to accept of his invitation to the wedding this however he obstinately refused for some time but mr andrews urging ethelindas request whose knowledge of his passion he had never been informed of and which entirely screened the impropriety of her invitation at length prevailed upon him to exert a bravery which mr andrews was charmed with for after that effort should be over he was in hopes of retrieving his dear friend back again into the world once more  these two philosophic friends then immediately began to prepare themselves for the ungrateful journey but were prevented by mr bevilles falling ill of a slow fever which had been creeping on him for several days and at last confined him to his room the very day that had been fixed on for their departure his feelings were too strong for his philosophy and though the mind had triumphed its victory was over the body  mr andrews sent directly for a physician and wrote an apology to mr carewe wishing him and the fair ethelinda complete happiness both in his own name and mr bevilles also who had generously desired his compliments to be added upon this occasion mr andrews was extremely alarmed at his friends danger and a good deal puzzled also with regard to the widows character from mr carewes letter did it not appear that there had been an engagement between them before her marriage and yet at the time she was made acquainted with mr bevilles unfortunate passion did she not speak though with a becoming prudence and modesty yet in such a manner as might have inspired the fondest hopes should her hand have ever been again at her own disposal and yet  but woman is woman  varium et mutabile and love has its own laws arbitrary and capricious  chap clxxxvii mr beville declined every day notwithstanding all the aid of physic and his life was almost despaired of when to poor mr andrewss great satisfaction he saw his worthy friend the clergyman alight at the door this visit had an happy effect upon our patient his conversation soothed his spirits the society of a friend ranks high among the materiae medicae and his prescription soon restored his health he administered jamess powders to him and his fever quitted him the next day  the reunion of these three friends was such a pleasure as the reader who has either virtue or sentiment must suppose to himself better than i can express it and if he wants sense or feeling no words can convey an idea of it to him mr beville continued for some days confined to his bed which left mr andrews an opportunity of communicating to his friend the clergyman when they were alone mr carewes letter with just so much of his story and of bevilles as was necessary to explain and render it unaccountable at the same time  the morning that mr beville found himself able to quit his chamber and while they were walking about the parlour and conversing together in a more free and disingaged manner than usual they perceived a coach and six with a large retinue driving toward the house they all looked out at the window without being able to guess what new adventure was going to occur when the equipage stopped at the door and they saw mr carewe alight leading forth the fair mourning bride by the hand  mr andrews and the clergyman were much embarrassed upon this occasion on account of poor mr beville who changed color at the sight and walked instantly away from the window but quickly recollecting himself he turned about briskly again saying my friends fear me not  i have already paid the fine of disappointment and am henceforth free of misfortune for life  chap clxxxviii mr andrews was in such confusion that he suffered his new guests to come into the room before he could step forward to meet them welcomes embracings and wishing of joy were given and received with equal stiffness and venus to the loves around remarked how ill they all dissembled it must have been a greater painter of the passions than le brun who could have drawn this groupe of persons up to the life for though our new guests might have been ever so capable of justifying their own conduct upon logical principles yet beyond the fixed and settled rules there is an undefinable moral and in the slightest appearance of disingenuousness something highly offensive to liberal minds  the beauty of the lovely widow transcended her wedding charms which had then wanted a year of their perfection her person was now completely formed her carriage easier and more free her air a lively spirit had informed her eyes  not by supplanting modesty but correcting bashfulness the roses in her cheeks were fuller blown the cherries became more ripened in her lips and the pearly whiteness of her skin shone with superior luster set in weeds  this garb declared her still to be a widow which added to the distress of the three friends who were in hopes the marriageceremony had been over without their being obliged to be the mournful witnesses of it after about two hours constrained conversation among four of the company mr beville doing nothing all the while but gaze and sigh dinner was served which did not hold them long at table for mr andrews had not been sufficiently prepared for a wedding feast  after tea and coffee was over and that ethelinda had retired to the library mr carewe turning to the clergyman said that he looked upon it as a fortunate circumstance to meet him at the farm upon this occasion as the character he had been taught to conceive of him from mr andrewss representation might promise an happy event to any business he should become a party in he therefore requested the favor of him to tie the indissoluble or deathresolving knot the next morning for which said he taking a license out of his pocket and presenting it to him this shall be your sufficient warrant  it is now full time for me continued mr carewe to reveal to you the only memoir of my life that has hitherto been kept a secret from you and which i shall do in as few words as possible by informing you that my acquaintance with your fair guest within here commenced even so early as her birth for about three years before i had been exiled from my fathers house my dear mother groaned her into the world  the surprise and astonishment of the rest of the company is not to be described they stood mute near a minute staring at each other before they could recollect themselves or be able to form any manner of conclusion from such unexpected premises till the clergyman upon looking into the license pronounced aloud the name of william beville who at the sound cried out too much too much too  and sunk back again into his chair after he had raised himself out of it to fly into carewes arms  mr carewe ran up to embrace and wish him joy and the mutual happiness of these four friends was inexpressible but by tears mr carewe then took his brother under the arm and led him alone into the library where the fair widow sat reading reclined upon a sopha she blushed at seeing them come together into the room and rose to receive them carewe joined their hands and retired  beville still holding his grasp threw himself instantly at her feet unable to speak to her but with his eyes she cast a regard toward him of tenderness and modesty and raising him up the contract was sealed by a mutual and fond embrace  chap clxxxix the next day the lovely ethelindas nuptials were celebrated with all the decency and decorum imaginable no commonplace jests no arch innuendos no privileged manners one might have imagined themselves present at the initiating of a vestal rather than a modern marriage the morning after mr beville taking mr andrews aside addressed him thus  my dear brother and benefactor my unhappy sister brought you no fortune and her worth needed no addition but as her loss wants much repair you will give me leave to present you with this bill which providence seems to have kept detached from the rest of its unmerited bounties to me in order to enable me to pay my debts both of obligation and of honor  so saying he laid a paper on the table and quitted the room it was a bill of exchange on a banker in london for five thousand pounds which his friend the condisciple had received as a marriageportion with ethelinda and which happened to have remained unexchanged at the time of his death  this amiable society enjoyed the seraphic harmony of love friendship and halcyon skies together for about a fortnight till mr and mrs beville took their leave and were just setting out one morning for condisciplehall when their journey was interrupted by the threatening of a storm which rising by degrees to the extremest height seemed as if tempest was collecting its forces together from all the elements to shake the earths foundation to the center  the air grew sudden dark the clouds quick blend their floating waters in one troubled mass oershadowing the gloomy face of nature the rumorous winds moand through the trembling woods and the earths caverns echoed back the groan the multitudinous sea soon grew convulsed the waves came riding over each others heads like roaring lions hungerdriven abroad or foaming boars slipped by unbridled hell against its victim weak defenseless man while he upon the beach stands unappalld in wonder only and religion lost still resting sure on that coercive word which taught the insensate surge to know its bound the lurid flashes of the lightnings glare added new horror to factitious night the rolling thunders seemed in adverse war from east to west in clamorous opposition the rains descend in torrents through the plain and swelling rivers rushing to the sea repelled run back affrighted to their source the tempest raged and over the boisterous deep gigantic terror scowld and mute despair while the elements at civil strife proclaimed creations wreck this globe to atoms hurled and restoration of old chaos reign chap cxc the storm commenced at ten oclock in the morning was at the height at five in the evening and continued without abatement till twelve at night it then began to subside and about four the next morning the wind seemed to cease as being out of breath when mr andrews was awakened by his servants coming into his chamber to tell him that one of the neighboring villagers had just then run up to the house to acquaint him that a ship had been stranded and beat to pieces near the farm that the few passengers who had escaped the waves were in the highest distress and that the country was hastening down upon the shore to make a wreck of the vessel  mr andrews whose whole soul had received the inspiration of public virtue had taken out a commission of the peace for the shire of york as soon as his house was built which with the character he had established even in the short time of his residence in that country entitled and encouraged the inhabitants within his district to call upon him preferably on any occasion where an extraordinary exertion of spirit humanity or justice was deemed necessary  he arose instantly and sent to mr carewe and the clergyman to do the same they all dressed with the utmost dispatch armed themselves their servants and the laborers without disturbing mr beville for fear of alarming the bride mounted their horses and galloped down to the shore at about a miles distance they saw the ship in a shattered condition lying on its side in shallow water on the tides ebb  they perceived many bodies floating several persons wading through the sea some standing still with imploring arms extended toward the strand others fainting through weakness and thrown often on their faces by the slightest wind or wave the populace that had lined the shore awed by authority and arms dispersed immediately upon the appearance of mr andrews who with mr carewe rode through the tide attended by their party to the succor of this poor shipwrecked crew and soon brought them all the dead the dying and the surviving to a little village near the shore  here they were distributed among the several cabbins where every manner of hospitable assistance was administered to recover the seeming dead revive the drooping and refresh the strong the three friends divided the charge equally and separating themselves took different portions of the village under their respective care  mr andrews dispatched horsemen up to his house for garments of all kinds both male and female for there were some women among the distressed who by their appearances and apparel even under the strong disguise of their misfortune seemed to be persons of some distinction the messengers soon returned and in a short time after followed mr and mrs beville who having been awakened by the hurry in the house and informed of this distressful adventure arose and ran down to the village in order to join their ready assistance in so humane an office  chap cxci mr carewe in visiting one of the hospitals in his department was told by the woman of the house that a beautiful young lady had been given into her charge who appeared to be dead but that on holding her up by the heels for some time till a great quantity of water had run off from her stomach then putting on a warm shift and placing her in an aired bed she had seemed to afford some tokens of returning life and might probably be saved if any one could be got to bleed her instantly  mr carewe quick ran through the streets crying out for a surgeon a barber or even a lance when the clergyman hearing him came out of a cottage with a bloody lancet in his hand and offered his assistance saying that he had just then performed an operation with success on a young gentleman who was mourned as dead by his weeping servants mr carewe ran back with him to his fair patient the clergyman pierced her arm and some blood flowed slowly for about half a minute toward the end of which she seemed to breathe and at length her eyes opened  during this interval mr carewe leaned over the bed examining the features of the patient with a look of earnestness of doubt and inquiry but on her opening her eyes he threw himself on his knees and catching her in his arms cried out my lost my recovered love my constancys reward my virtues praemium o turn and behold your friend your lover your husband a penitent at your feet o let  he was going on when at the sound of these last expressions she interrupted him with a sudden start and turning her languid eyes upon him endeavored to utter something when her arm stopped bleeding and she without a figh or struggle instantly expired in his arms  the wretched carewe stared wildly on the corpse for a time without drawing his breath or speaking a word then clasped its cold bosom close to his breast endeavoring but in vain to weep when after holding it there for a minute with his eyes fixed as in death he cast it suddenly from him and springing upon his feet cried out i am damned  she is gone heavens messenger to send the furies for me infinite justice must have atonement for innocence defiled no salvos here i have but one life to pay but give it freely  o may it be accepted like the widows mite and wipe from out my score the multitude of my offenses  at these words he snatched up the lance which the clergyman through his astonishment and terror at this extraordinary and affecting scene had left neglected on the table and would have destroyed himself with it if he had not on the instant recovered presence of mind enough to spring forward with a brisk action and catch hold of his arm the poor distracted carewe struggled for a while till wasting his strength in exclamation and dropping the lance on the floor he sunk into a chair  just at this moment the door opened and the young man who had been recovered by bleeding walked slowly into the room leaning on mr beville with his arm tied up his air languid and his face sicklied over with weakness fatigue and grief but under all these disadvantages it was easy to perceive a most beautiful composition of features a fine proportioned shape with a most graceful figure he was led toward the bed but upon viewing the corpse expressed an heavy moan and fainted on the body  chap cxcii mr carewe whose chair had been turned from this scene being roused by the noise started hastily up and beholding the dying embrace cried out what a rival in death also o hapless youth  o happy rather  no more the object of my jealousy but envy  whose grief equalling thy love has forbid thy life one moment to survive thy loss  in the mean time mr beville and the clergyman did every thing in their power to recover the young man from his swoon and after they had raised him up sprinkled water in his face and applied salts to his nose they had the pleasure to find him coming a little to his senses upon which they placed him in a chair and spread a covering over the corpse to hide it from the view of the distracted corrivals  mr carewe stood all this while in the middle of the room with his arms folded across his eyes fixed on the ground and his soul laboring with the most dismal reflections when upon hearing the young mans voice who had now begun to make acknowledgments to his kind assistants he stared he listened he started and extending wide his arms gracious heaven cried he out what will the fates do with me what dead and alive at once does providence then make sport of torments it is impossible  and yet it is certain  it is she my harriot lives o let me catch her in these arms once more though the extreme of bliss should prove too strong for life itself to bear  he sprung forward at these words fell kneeling at her feet grasped her hand with rapture and gazed upon her face with fondness surprise and joy her astonishment was likewise great and her difficulties no less though mr beville upon the first alarm of this discovery was so polite as to remove some of them by quitting the room and taking the clergyman along with him  eloisa trembled all over and could not resist the first transports her own passion sympathising with his but recollecting herself soon and forcing herself from his hold mr carewe said she with a blush the surprise of this adventure has thrown us both too much off our guard  there is one i presume to whom these professions these regards more properly belong and i entreat that you may no longer injure your own honor nor attempt to disturb my peace again  oh my lamented farsought love my everesteemed and longpurposed wife cried he out with impatience your mistake in this particular has been the fatal cause of our tedious and unhappy separation the expression i made use of to your steward was fondly meant toward you and i had before then been for some time in quest of you and have ever since with constant ardour pursued your flight in vain through most of the countries in europe  i do confess my truant youth had been too insensible of the love i bore you at our parting but upon comparing my sentiments of you with the transient and unsatisfactory passions with which all other objects had been capable of inspiring me since i soon perceived my happiness wound up in yours your love alone the means and your alliance the sole end of all my future bliss  as he pronounced these last words a sudden burst of triumphant tears flowed down her lovely cheeks and she sunk into his arms supporting herself from falling by a close embrace while the oerpowered carewe could answer only with his arms his looks and sighs shakespeare is dead nor is there now alive one capable of language or feelings able to describe a scene of such contrasted passions of love of gratitude of honor of contrition of surprise of joy of silence and expression  chap cxciii mr carewe as soon as he could recollect any thing which did not immediately relate to his passion led his eloisa out of the room where the corpse lay into one adjoining it on pretense that she might remain more private here to change her dress and commence a woman now for life in order to which transformation he sent into the next cottage where the farmwardrobe had been deposited and obtained for her a complete suit of female clothes and linen  he was extremely unhappy about his son whom he apprehended to have been swallowed up in the waves but was too tender to make any inquiry concerning him which might awaken his eloisa to distraction however upon finding her without either lamentation or inquiry after him returning again to tears and exclamations on the death of the lady in the next room he stopped her short by crying out but first my hermes o what of him thanks to allprotecting heaven replied she in a transport i left him behind at thoulouse when my dear sister who has just expired called on me there with her husband in their route from montpelier to portugal  i loved her said she renewing her tears with the fondness of a sister enlivened by the warmth of a friend it was some years since we had parted last i found myself unhappy at the thought of her quitting me so soon and resolved to accompany her on her tour so leaving our dear child in the care of my faithful steward i proceeded on the journey along with my sister and brother and arrived safe at lisbon  this most amiable pair continued she about a year before had lost two lovely children their whole stock in the smallpox the grief of the parents was immoderate and in a short time affected both their healths my poor sister had got the addition of a severe cold by sitting up day and night with her children her disorder fell upon her lungs and soon showed certain symptoms of a decay  my dear brother who loved her passionately had a consultation of physicians upon her case who after having practiced on her without effect advised her going to spa from thence she was sent to aix thence to montpelier and then to lisbon this course which we may better style a tour had it been capable of answering any other end than mere amusement was as necessary to her husband as to herself  mens minds they say are stronger than ours and i believe it but then i am of opinion also that their strength serves them better to resist than to endure misfortune throw them but a moment off their guard till calamity shall have slipped into their breasts their resentments and struggles being greater the sooner weaken their force the convulsions of a giant are an earthquake to those of a dwarf  whether such was the case or no with regard to this worthy man or whether his unhappiness infinitely exceeded here is by foreseeing her early death i cannot determine but about a month ago after we had been at lisbon near a quarter of a year he was attacked by a fever on his spirits which put an end to his life in ten days  what a wretch did he leave behind him she was deprived of reason for three days and the moment she recovered it she resolved upon quitting the kingdom instantly she was reduced now to a weaker state than ever and i would have deferred her voyage till the spring but she was inflexible  i asked the physicians there what climate they would now recommend to my dear sister to breathe in but they replied that lisbon was the ne plus ultra of health and that since it had not done her any service they feared no other region on the globe would avail except the returning again to her native air might produce some salutary effect and which was a thing frequently recommended by the college  we then began to prepare for our voyage for i was resolved to accompany her into england and retire with her to some private country scene where she had never seen either her children or her husband or any thing which might remind her particularly of either  there would i have remained with her till she should be either released from a sickly and unhappy life or so far restored to health as to be able to accompany me in my scheme of traveling and purpose of living abroad we waited some time for a ship at last we embarked the wind changed and shifted us out of our course and after some days sailing to and fro drove us at length amidst this perilous storm the rest you know  mr carewe embraced her at this period wiping away her tender tears with kisses then leaving her to change her dress went out to inquire after some of the passengers whom she said were persons she had lately become acquainted with and conceived a friendship for and whose safety therefore she was sincerely interested in  when he got into the street he met mr beville coming from visiting one of the cottages and taking him by the arm you see my dear brother said he that providence has at length thought fit to bless my wishes with the possession of the amiable eloisa again but i must insist upon it that you never reveal the secret history of our love to any person whatsoever not excepting my sister  had i retained the least glimpse of hope of ever recovering her again i should not have been so unguarded even to my dearest friends but though there is nothing in her most private memoirs so circumstanced and so uninformed as she really was at a certain era which ought to affect her character in the opinion of philosophy or candor yet women or the world are apt to censure failings which their own feelings should incline them to excuse  enough replied mr beville and more than was necessary to me my most excellent friend  may she make you as happy as you have rendered me and if confirmed virtue on one side and approved honor on the other can render you so your union must be blessed they then walked down together to mr andrewss quarters and met mrs beville at one of the doors having just stepped out to refresh herself after the fatigue of administering cordials to two ladies who had been among the wretched passengers and helping them to put on dry clothes which she had provided for them  chap cxciv during all these transactions mr andrews was extremely active in his department supplying wine which he had ordered down from his own house and raiment which he purchased from the inhabitants to the sailors and poor passengers who had escaped the wreck and came half naked to the shore  the captain of the vessel too was one of the objects which fell under his attention but he refused any kind of help except brandy nor did he afford the least manner of assistance to any one of the crew though well enough able to have done it as he had escaped free from all damage but wetting he sat by a cabin fire drying the clothes on his back smoking a pipe quaffing off half pints of brandy at a draught and swearing at the storm so loud and impiously as were enough to have provoked a second tempest  mr andrews having now finished his circuit and provided for every thing in his rounds came at length to the house where we are at present to rest himself and pay his particular compliments to the ladies whom he had before left under the care of mrs beville he arrived just at the time that beville and carewe came to the door and they all walked into the parlour together where they were hardly seated when the clergyman who had been active in his office of visiting praying by and exhorting of the sick came in and took his seat among them  mr carewe impatient to communicate his joy taking mr andrews by the hand cried out in a transport o my dear friend my eloisa is found among the wreck is recovered to life and has this moment accepted my hand mr andrews overcome both with pleasure and surprise had power to express himself no other way than by catching him in his arms and shedding silent speaking tears  as soon as mr carewe could disengage himself he turned toward mrs beville and the clergyman who though one of them knowing nothing at all and the other nothing material of his story were both most heartily wishing him joy and immediately related to them a short extempore novel of his love which satisfied their curiosity as well as the real adventure would have done  the greatest difficulty his invention had to struggle with here was how to account for his harriots appearance in mens clothes but the turn he gave to it at last was that being resolved to inform herself of every thing worth seeing or knowing while she was in portugal she had disguised her sex under a male habit that attended by her brotherinlaw she might enjoy a freedom which by the manners of that country women are restrained from  mr andrews quick perceived the delicacy of mr carewes intention and was highly pleased with his address and readiness of invention  splendide mendax  he then sent up his compliments to the two ladies above stairs to inquire how they were and being answered that they were not yet prepared to admit a visit he with the rest of his company went out together to pay their compliments to their new and fair ally  they found her completely dressed in ethelindas first wedding suit and rivalling the beauties of her bridal day  a roral blush which had diffused itself over all her features on seeing this unexpected company come into the room enriched her charms and banished from her face all traces of fatigue or grief they became enamoured of her at first sight and mr carewe also confessed improved beauties and acquired graces both in her ripened features and now finished form  he performed the office of gentleman usher and introduced the company to the bride mentioning the relation connection or character of each person respectively she received them all with the polite address of new acquaintances joined to the generous warmth of old friendships and after the usual congratulations and occasional civilities had been passed and repassed among them mr andrews took eloisa by the hand and led the way back to the house he had just come from as it was the largest in the village and that he had some further hospitalities to offer to the two distressed ladies who were lodged there  chap cxcv soon after they had come into the house a message was delivered to mr andrews from the ladies above stairs that they would be glad of his company along with his friends to return them all thanks for the humane and charitable assistance afforded them in this great article of distress and danger they obeyed the summons and went up together they found a lady alone in the room of a genteel person and about fifty years of age sitting on the side of a bed who upon their entrance rose up to receive them and addressed them thus  my generous friends i have the extremest gratitude to acknowledge to you all for your timely and necessary aid in this our great calamity but my thanks are more particularly due to you sir said she turning herself toward mr andrews who i have the pleasure to learn has been the first mover and chief instrument under providence upon this occasion as soon as i was capable continued she of inquiring upon what coast of england i had been thrown and had heard your name sounded from below it afforded me a singular joy to find that we had owed our lives to a person for whom though but little known i had been taught by others to conceive so true a friendship and esteem  mr andrews was equally surprised and confounded at so partial a compliment but moving up slowly toward her and beginning by degrees to recollect her person cried out at length thou generous parent of my lost fanny welcome from death and to these arms again o since thy kindness could not save her precious life yet let it be some alleviation of my grief that i have had the fortune to rescue yours  after they had tenderly embraced each other the lady begging leave to sit down and entreating all the company to do the same applied herself again to mr andrews saying with great emotion o my dear nephew urge not a subject over again which is now past lamenting for you and but revives a fruitless grief in me who if i feel it less at present am weaker still to bear it speak to me rather of yourself your children and your fortunes these be our only cares now say what of these  mr andrews then gave her as short an account of himself and his family as possible by saying that he was rich and they were well being impatient to inquire about her daughters health which he pleaded his emotion and surprise for not having done sooner she answered with the fondness of a mother my dear and only child thank heaven and you is in the room within there and out of danger but both her mind and body being more easily affected than mine have prevented her from being able yet to appear and join in my acknowledgments  chap cxcvi just then mr andrewss steward who had been appointed to land the passengers effects from the ship came into the room to inform him that he had brought all the luggage safe ashore and lodged them in the parlour below the aunt upon hearing this immediately ordered a large deal box to be brought up stairs  she then told mr andrews that she had two presents to make him on condition that he would summon his philosophy in aid and arm the whole man within him to abide the test o madam exclaimed he and clasping his hands together losses which can be ever forgot may have their sense renewed but in me what monument can awaken griefs which never yet have slept  when the box was opened she took out a picture and placed it on a chair before him it was the horrid spectacle of his wife ghostlike and slow expiring on a deathbed he started at first though prepared then standing mute and motionless before it with uplifted hands and head reclined gazed at the portrait till it almost became his own fond beville wept the rest joined too in silent grief and even the aunt to whom notwithstanding this object had now grown familiar here dropped her sympathetic tear  after she had suffered them for a while to indulge in this sad luxury to vulgar minds unknown she took out another picture and placed it on the same chair before the first this object surprised the whole company more than the last because it puzzled them with regard to the order of its succession  it was the portrait of mrs andrews drawn in perfect health and beautys bloom the astonished husband viewed it over with rapture crying aloud just such she was just such she is again an angel heavenly bright but where the crown of glory where the seraphs plumes which should have marked her spirit for the skies he was continuing thus to rave when his ecstasy was suddenly interrupted by the original rushing into the room and flying into his arms  chap cxcvii in imitation of the great timanthes in his famous picture upon the sacrifice of iphigenia i must here let fall the curtain to hide those features which no painting can express o reader there is no describing of this scene the wonder the joy the emotion  i was present at this interview and so i happened to be on the late execution at lisbon but this affected me much more in the criminal case one goes prepared with resolution a reflection on the crime abates compassion and justice acquiesces in the rack philosophy besides informs us that pain is tolerable only to a certain degree beyond which it ceases with life together but here the spectator is first taken by surprise and then a willing captive surrenders himself up bound hand and foot to a transport of pleasure exceeding into pain  after the first effects of amazement and joy had a little subsided the clergyman stepping forward begged that before any one should call for an explanation of this miracle the whole company should join him in worship to that almighty being who is the worker of all miracles who stilleth the raging of the sea and the noise of his waves and the madness of the people psalm lxv ver     the proposal was readily embraced and the rest of the house being called together they all kneeled down to prayer in the midst of it he introduced part of the  0 th psalm from the   th to the   d verses both inclusive which was so extremely applicable to the present occasion that the whole congregation repeated it after him with as much fervency of devotion as if it had been an extempore hymn  when this pious duty to providence was ended and that proper instructions had been given about the unfortunate widows funeral they all prepared to set out for the farm the gentlemen subscribed a purse among them for the relief of the crew and to reward the villagers eloisa mrs andrews and her aunt having suspended their votive garments were taken by mrs beville into her equipage and the gentlemen attended them on horseback  as soon as the coach arrived at the farm little harry and fanny ran out to the door to meet their father  mrs andrews and her children here let me draw the veil again  chap cxcviii after dinner tea and the happy eloisas wedding were over and that all interruption of servants was removed mrs beville seemed very impatient to have the mystery explained of mrs andrewss recovery her long absence from her husband and children with her total silence toward them during that so interesting an interval  she looked first at mr andrews then at mr beville thinking it most natural for one or other of them to begin the inquiry  but their whole souls were so much wrapped up in the reality of her existence that the least thought about reconciling of appearances never once entered into their heads  she then turned herself toward the clergyman wtth an eye of curiosity hinting the question she would have proposed but he happened to be so entirely occupied in contemplations of an higher nature that he did not remark the expressions of her countenance any more than beville or andrews had done  after these disappointments applying herself to her brother she begged of him in a low voice to make the proposition but neither he nor eloisa to whom she also addressed herself gave the least attention to her request for their hearts and minds were so happily engaged in their own mutual discoveries he of her person and she of his love that they seemed to have no manner of curiosity at that time about any matter foreign to their own concerns  the impatience of the fair ethelinda increased at every difficulty  women love little novels extremely as mrs seawell says chap clxiii parag    and finding that the opening of the scene rested solely upon herself she at length addressed herself directly to the old lady in these words madam said she i have borne my share with great sincerity in the general joy which this happy and unexpected event in your family has diffused among us all but as i happen to be one of those persons who are not sufficiently satisfied with merely being happy wihout knowing how they have become so i must entreat the favor of you to afford us a detail of all the extraordinary incidents which must have happened to this lady and to you since your leaving this kingdom together  this proposition immediately engaged the attention of the rest of the company and they all joined their voices in the same request the good old lady bowed and prepared herself to satisfy their curiosity  but upon opening her mouth she was suddenly seized with such a fit of yawning that she was not able to utter one syllable for a considerable time and when she had composed her muscles sufficiently to speak it was only to desire a respite till the next morning saying that the fatigue she had undergone both of body and mind the foregoing day and night was then calling upon her so pressingly for rest that she must beg leave for the present to retire to bed the whole company bowed and some of them nodded too upon which hint the aunts motion soon became general and each party following her example took up a candle and walked away supperless to their chambers  chap cxcix perhaps reader if you are a female you may feel yourself as much disappointed here madam as the inquisitive ethelinda appears to have been last night  but if you are a man you have reason i assure you sir to be greatly rejoiced at this interruption for it is much better that she should yawn herself to sleep before she began the story than that you should be obliged to stretch your jaws at her narration  women have such a tedious manner of telling a story with a said he and said she then again he said and she said then she came into the room and coming into the room  with other needless repetitions conversations without subjects characters without manners language without style families without likeness passion expiring in declamation and action standing stock still staring at narrative running by itself till it is out of breath  but prithee are we to receive no manner of satisfaction upon this point at all and because an old woman is apt to talk too much must every one else be dumb no sir by no means i shall do you reason myself but will give you a story in a few pages which would have taken her up a volume for she commenced it the next morning immediately after breakfast and kept the company up to yawningtime after supper before she had got herself on shipboard  chap cc after mrs andrews had been given over by the physicians at spa the aunt was writing a letter one night to mr andrews when her daughter came crying into the room saying that her dear cousin had just then expired in her arms the aunt ran immediately to her bedside and judging from all appearances that she was really dead after some effusions of grief returned to her letter and added these words alas our fanny is no more then sealing it with black wax sent it off to the post  our fanny it seems had only fainted through weakness at this time and the nursetender perceiving still some signs of life in her patient called for assistance and by the application of proper remedies she was recovered to sense again before the next morning  the aunt would then have recalled the last paragraph of her letter but it was too late for that and yet too soon to venture to contradict it her death seemed only delayed and she thought it would have been cruel after he had received the shock to have amused mr andrews with a fruitless hope which none of her physicians had in the least encouraged  her fair cousin who was herself in a deep decay and loved her with a double sympathy of affection and disorder prevailed upon her a day or two after her swoon to suffer her picture to be drawn in the very situation she then lay for which she gave this virtuous and philosophic reason that the looking on it sometimes might serve to mortify every vain proud or presumptuous thought which should ever hereafter happen to arise in her own breast by showing to what a condition even health youth and beauty might be so suddenly reduced  mrs andrews continued in this languishing way all the winter one week giving hopes and another despair of her recovery till at length toward spring the physicians upon finding her still holding out in a fluctuating state pronounced that possibly the warm air of lisbon might establish her health which hint was readily taken hold of by the aunt both out of affection to her niece and that she imagined her own daughter might also receive some benefit from the same climate  as soon as it was possible for them to begin their journey this female triumvirate set out from spa traveling to breast by slow marches to prevent fatigue to the two invalids the daughter happened to catch cold on the road her seasickness was extreme and two days after she had landed at lisbon she was seized with a diarrhoea which carried her off in about a week  chap cci here reader have i saved you a world of embarrassment in this part of the story by snatching it out of the mothers mouth why should you be reduced to grieve for a person whom you knew not sufficiently to be concerned about and why should you be delayed the pleasure of hearing that upon this loss the aunt to whom by her husbands will the daughters estate of twelve hundred pounds a year had devolved immediately adopted her niece our old acquaintance and favorite for her heir it was this circumstance which afforded the good old lady the equivocation of saying at the village that her dear and only child was in the room within  whether the motion of the sea like stirring up of land might have given some latent seeds of health a power to germinate  whether the spring of the air in this dry climate might have caused a brisker circulation in her blood  or finally which is by no means the least physical hypothesis of the three whether the satisfaction created in her mind by finding herself her husband and her children thus redeemed from difficulty and want to affluence and ease might have given a salutary elasticity to her nerves i am not philosopher enough to pronounce nor indeed is it worth our inquiry here while this truth is certain that mrs andrews began visibly to recover at lisbon in a short time after her landing  as soon as she was restored to health and features again her aunt got her portrait taken chap cxcvi last parag  for a reason of pretty much the same religious cast with her daughters to show by placing it near the former that the hand which to prove the vanity of mortal boasts can reduce health and beauty to deformity and distemper can in manifestation of its goodness and mercy restore them both again to their former vigor and luster  chap ccii while mrs andrews continued in a desperate state of health and even after her recovery appeared to be possible the physicians at spa had laid all persons about her under an injunction to keep her mind as much or even more than her body free from all manner of emotion either of joy or grief suffering every passion and affection of the soul to subside to wholesome apathy  our aunt took advantage of this restriction she had never ventured to tell her niece of the mistaken paragraph in her letter to mr andrews and yet without doing so how could she be able to account for so fond an husbands never writing a line to his wife or troubling himself even with inquiring about her health from the aunt  this precept of the physician then most luckily removed that difficulty and having been delivered before the patient herself the aunt immediately declared that she would acquaint mr andrews of this restriction by the next post forbidding him to write any letter to his wife thenceforward till he should receive a license from her to renew his correspondence  at the same time she assured her that she would direct her steward to send her constant accounts of her husband father and children which she would communicate freely to her while they all continued in an uniform and uninteresting tenor of health but that she must not expect to hear even of a toothache or a kibed heel till her mind should be able to stand upon its own legs again  the expiring mrs andrews acquiesced in this disposition of things not so much for the expediency of the advice as because her mind had for some time begun to wean itself from all human connections not in the least by weakening their force in her breast but by infinitely outweighing them with the regards of another life  the good old woman did accordingly direct her steward in the manner she had promised and received continued advice from him of every change in mr andrewss situation and circumstances his debrise in hertfordshire his fathers death and will with his present residence near scarborough it was by knowing of this last particular that she had discovered him so quickly at the village upon just hearing the name of andrews pronounced  chap cciii however all these articles of his fortunes both good and bad with old bevilles death also she kept still a secret from her niece till after her being pronounced out of danger at lisbon and then upon her beginning to recommence a correspondence with her husband she was made acquainted with the truth of the story this information rendered her extremely unhappy she reflected with vast uneasiness upon her dear husbands still continuing in the same error and was for immediately letting fly an express to england with a letter from her own hand to acquaint him of her recovery  but her aunt restrained all this ecstasy by saying that the too sudden surprise and joy of such an unlocked and unhopedfor discovery might possibly produce some dangerous effect upon his health or mind that she might have the happiness of seeing him and her children together much sooner by setting out immediately for england herself than by waiting for his coming to lisbon that she would hire a ship and sail directly to harwich which was near her own seat and that an express from thence would reach him sooner than the packet from lisbon going round by london  the design of this very good old gentlewoman was to have wrote to mr andrews as soon as she should arrive at her own house to come to her and bring his children along with him without undeceiving him about his wife this miracle she meant to have opened to him by degrees and one of the methods which she had purposed to have employed toward that end was to show him the two portraits in the same order that she did at the village  she imagined that upon his seeing the living picture so reversely succeed the dying one it might naturally raise some hope some suspicion some inquiry in him at least how it was possible to have obtained the second portrait after death but we have already seen how little success she had upon that experiment for the hurry of mr andrewss passions when his dear fanny was the object left him no leisure for the exercise of his reason or reflection which joined to the impatience of the fond mrs andrews precipitated the denouement before the plot had ripened to maturity  mrs andrews approved extremely of this whole plan of operation and they began to prepare themselves for the voyage with the utmost expedition and hired a ship to set sail the next morning for england when an extraordinary accident happened which detained them at lisbon for above four months after their preparations for setting out  chap cciv there was a priest who lodged in the same house with them and with whom they had become very intimate by their frequent intercourse with the people of the family he was a lively agreeable person with an elegant taste in polite literature and having been born and bred a frenchman had something extremely easy and polite in his address and manners  the only point of good breeding in which he seemed to be deficient was his too frequently urging the argument of religion in conversation but all his scholastic divinity and jesuitical sophistry were with ease exposed by mrs andrews from the extreme perspicuity of her own natural sense assisted by the instructions she had so frequently received from her learned and ingenious friend the clergyman  mrs andrewss understanding with her returning beauty began soon to attract the regards of the abbe and his particular address toward her became at length so remarkable as to give her offense when she perceived it she commenced a reserve by degrees till she had withdrawn herself entirely from any manner of society with the family where she lodged and afterward refused the visits of the abbe on pretense of indisposition  affairs were in this situation when a ship was hired and the ladies were to have set sail the next morning at ten oclock but at the hour of twelve the night before after they had both been in bed for some time they were awakened by a loud knocking at the portal of the house the door was opened and the noise ceased there for a few minutes but was again repeated at the bedchamber door where mrs andrews and her aunt lay  they immediately called out to inquire the cause of this disturbance and were answered by their landlady who in a most doleful tone of voice informed them that the most high and holy court of inquisition had sent their secretary with a guard to take mrs andrews into safe custody till a trial should be appointed her for certain blasphemies and profane expressions uttered by her against holy mother the church in derogation of ancient relics modern miracles and divine saintworship  the unhappy mrs andrews quick perceived the priests hand and the clovenfoot together in this most horrid prosecution which appeared still plainer after she and her aunt had dressed themselves and opened the door when she saw the abbe enter the room alone with his arms folded and his countenance masked under an assumed vizard of sorrow and compassion but soon shifting his saints look to a satyrs leer he whispered to her in french that it was in her power to dismiss the suit on the instant and that upon such very easy terms as these  merely to prefer love liberty and life to prison death and torture  i hope that none of my readers will harbor the least manner of doubt with regard to mrs andrewss option upon this occasion my female readers i dare swear have already determined the choice for her between these alternatives as the story of the nuns of collingham who cut off their noses to preserve their chastity  is one of their strongest articles of faith  i doubtless do prefer said she speaking aloud love liberty and life to prison death and torture  but then by infinitely greater odds do i prefer prison death and torture before prostitution infamy and wrath i therefore submit myself not to the jurisdiction of this court but to the dispensations of providence which has already rescued me from a more imminent danger even than the present but if a second miracle in my favor may be too much for me to expect i shall still hope that implored heaven will proportion my strength to the struggle and raise my virtue above my torments  chap ccv the condition of the unhappy aunt who remained in uncertainty about her dear nieces life or death during several months may well be imagined without the aid of description for the walls of the inquisition cut off from the wretched prisoner all manner of communication with the world during her dismal confinement in that purgatory  she frequently applied to the judges of that most iniquitous court for leave only to see her niece even in the presence of any of their own officers but was inhumanly denied that satisfaction she then drew up a petition and watched an opportunity of presenting it in person to his portuguese majesty which happened to have this good effect that though it did not obtain her release it preserved her by the kings intercession from sustaining any manner of violence or undergoing a trial during her confinement there for the minister upon hearing that a british subject of some note was in question thought it politic to temporise with so potent an ally as england while a spanish war was depending  the aunt at one time drew up a memorial setting forth the real state of the case with the iniquity and malice of the abbes prosecution which she had designed to have delivered into the court of inquisition but upon communicating it to her landlord he advised her most strenuously against it saying that instead of redeeming her niece by this method she would infallibly involve herself in the same misfortune even without the least hope of redemption for that the defamation of a priest or the least censure against the church was held among them to be an infinitely more deadly sin than the highest profanation of god or religion itself  in this dreadful situation had both these unhappy women remained for about four months without any manner of consolation except this only which they each separately enjoyed that poor mr andrews had not been yet undeceived with regard to his dear fannys supposed death at the end of this period eloisa with her brother and sister arrived at lisbon and happening to take lodgings in the same hotel with our aunt became soon acquainted with this unhappy story  they all most cordially commiserated her misfortune and the brotherinlaw happening fortunately to be nephew to the new ambassador who had lately arrived from england to renew a treaty of alliance between the two crowns went instantly to wait upon him and obtained his promise that he would solicit the minister of portugal for mrs andrewss release and if refused would even proceed so far as to interest his own court on her behalf  he kept his word punctually with his nephew and succeeded in his suit but not time enough to afford him the satisfaction of knowing it for that good and unhappy man died before mrs andrews had been set at liberty which she obtained but just time enough to acknowledge her obligations to the ladies and to accompany them along with her aunt in their voyage to england  chap ccvi but to return to the farm these eight persons formed one of the most extraordinary and most amiable societies that can well be imagined the sense virtue fondness friendship and cheerfulness of the whole company rendered them not only agreeable to each other but the objects of envy or admiration to all the world besides  the only interruption to their enjoyments was what mrs carewes grief for her brother and sister used often to occasion at first till it had subsided by degrees to a tender but composed concern for their loss which was confined to her own breast and rarely broke out any more to the disturbance of the company  this charming groupe of friends continued together at the farm till the middle of december when mr beville invited them all to spend the christmas with him at condisciplehall  from thence they proceeded to the deceased colonels seat to pass their easter with mr carewe and then returned to the farm on the whitsuntide following  in this stated rotation of friendly visits the triumvirate engaged to each other to enjoy the three great festivals of religion together during their lives appointing the worthy clergyman to be chaplain and almoner to this society which subscribed among them a purse of three hundred pounds a year to be distributed in charity at his sole discretion  the union and harmony of this happy family of friends subsist unbroken still and ever must subsist for their connections are founded on virtue and reciprocal obligation nothing worth relating has since occurred among them except the birth of children and the death of mr carewes father by which his fortune has received an addition of three thousand pounds a year
