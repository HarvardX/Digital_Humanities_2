the liverpool prize a farce in two acts as it performed at the theater royal in covent garden with universal applause written by f pilon  london printed for t evans near yorkbuildings strand mdcclxxix  price one shilling  preface it having been insinuated that the liverpool prize was written in the spirit of party the author takes this opportunity of publicly declaring that nothing could be further from his intention than such an idea if the maritime phrases so often repeated on a late public occasion be deemed satire in disguise he confesses himself too dull to find it out it was impossible to avoid using them in painting a sailor like teneriffe but admitting they were selected in consequence of their being temporary the writer of the liverpool prize has done no more in using them than the best dramatic writers have done before him and indeed ought to continue to do if the stage be the mirror of the times distinguished as shakespeare was and above the necessity of stooping to temporary allusions yet would he sometimes sacrifice to them in order to gratify the public a circumstance which has contributed not a little to that obscurity in his writings which has so long amused and perplexed the critics as to the liberty the author took in mentioning admiral keppels name he hopes no man is so great an enemy to his country as to ascribe it to party it was the tribute of his heart an echo to the voice of a whole nation loud in praise of a man who had so often fought the battles of old england with success and in whose hands the honor of the british flag can never tarnish  prologue written by the author spoken by mr lee jews in the character of a lotteryofficekeeper enters reading a playbill the liverpool prize what are these folks still on the twenty thousand paid

playrs did shakespeares genius light the present day all the worlds a lottry i am sure he would say what is the law but a deep scheme which tries to pick your pocket of a swinging prize physics

insure at doctors commons by divorce the state by all is a lottry allowed the wheels of state you know  sdeath i am too loud the lottry wheels good folks i mean to say the wheels of state go always
