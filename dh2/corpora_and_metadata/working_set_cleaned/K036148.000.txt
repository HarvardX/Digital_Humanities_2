an essay upon public spirit being a satyr in prose upon the manners and luxury of the times the chief sources of our present parties and divisions  by mr dennis  london printed for bernard lintott between the two temple gates in fleetstreet       the preface the following essay contains a bold but a general and therefore i hope an inoffensive satyr especially since it is writ with an intention to hurt none and to do good to all it neither reflects upon persons nor parties but is levelled at vices and not men the design of it is to show what public spirit is and in what condition it has been for several years amongst us and that it is only to be retrieved by that reformation of manners which the late king and her present majesty have often with so much wisdom as well as with so much religion recommended from the throne  the restoration of public spirit is certainly of the utmost importance to the duration of public liberty of which it is the only solid and lasting basis and though liberty is at present perfectly secure under the reign of the best of queens though it is threatened with no danger from the immediate protestant successors it is yet the duty of so great so wise and so brave a people to transmit to their latest posterity the rights and privileges which they have received from their remotest ancestors and they ought to take the more care of this at a season when such contagious distempers rage throughout europe as may make a great alteration in the line of succession in a little time  the modern statesmen and legislators of free nations seem to me to have been for the most part employed rather in remedying than in preventing great disorders and to have been more taken up in providing against the immediate political occasions of them than in removing the moral and the natural causes of them especially those two important ones the education of youth and the restraining of luxury in the elder sort of which the wise ancients took such peculiar care  it is morally impossible that liberty and luxury should live any where so long in so strict a consederacy as they have done at venice which is secure from faction by the harmony of its orders and from invasion by its scitution but in a mixed monarchy like curs where we are neither secure from division by our constitution though that constitution may for ought i know be the best that we are capable of nor from invasion by our situation both which are too evident from history and experience luxury that nourishes our passions and augments our wants must of necessity inflame our factions and augment our divisions and cannot be with too much care repressed  if what is here published is favorably received i shall endeavor to show in a second part the mighty mischiefs that the introduction of foreign manners and foreign luxury has done to this island and to the rest of europe and the proper methods that are to be used to restrain luxury and to retrieve public spirit  i must confess the reformation of manners ought to be one of the peculiar provinces of the clergy but at a time when they too often stoop from their seraphick contemplations and the high dignity of their function to intermeddle in human affairs they give us strong temptations to make reprisals upon them and to entrench upon an office which is properly theirs i believe it will appear by the following draught of the public manners that it is not for want of business proper to their function that they pollute the church with matters peculiar to the state which proceeding is the more difficult to be accounted for because by doing their own business that is by converting the souls and reforming the manners of men they would make an admirable provision for the safety and quiet of the government whereas by their meddling in civil matters they never fail to inflame mens passions to corrupt their manners to heighten their animosities to augment their divisions and to raise convulsions in the state  however neither the clergy nor the laysocieties for the reformation of manners can employ the most effectual method i mean according to human appearance for the immediate suppression of barefaced luxury the spreading contagion of which is the greatest corrupter of the public manners and the greatest extinguisher of public spirit that method can be only practiced by the joint authority of the queen and her great council that is by the wholesome severity of sumptuary laws or public taxes upon luxury and it was partly in order to show the reason if not the necessity of such taxes that the following essay was begun for whereas most of the taxes which have been hitherto laid have been laid upon our necessaries or our conveniences and the money that is gathered from both these substracts so much from the general stock of trade and consequently weakens and discourages industry a tax upon our superfluities and our luxuries will by rendering us frugal and consequently industrious have a tendency to the augmenting the national stock of trade besides it is plain that a tax upon our superfltities and our luxuries will do good to the whole community without being burdensome to any part of it for few will pay their money upon such a tax but they who are able to pay it or who will be animated and supported by their pride at least to pay it cheerfully and so luxury that is naturally an enemy to government will be made subservient to it and they who do not pay their money upon such a tax will be the more enabled to pay all the other taxes which will reconcile such a tax or such taxes to all the sober frugal and industrious part of the nation especially since we have shown above that nothing will more contribute to the uniting our minds than the restraining our luxuries upon which account no tax can be more effectual for the finishing this important war which our divisions prolong and as there will be more occasion for such a tax upon a general peace than there is now because luxury unrestrained by law will in all likelihood then increase and the increase of luxury will endanger this island more than the most dangerous foreign war upon this account it will be hard to invent a tax more proper to be continued for the paying the debts of the nation than a tax upon our vanities our superfluities and our luxuries for which reason the act for prohibiting immoderate gaming and that for preventing of duelling which are two of the fatal effects of luxury the latter of luxury and pride and the former of avarice and luxury complicated will be glorious to this parliament among all to whom the prosperity of their country is dear among all to whom law and public liberty are dear how inglorious has it been hitherto to this island which is and has always been governed by law that we have so long connived at a cruel custom a custom so gothic that there is no instance of it either in grecian or roman history and so destructive so arbitrary and so barbarous that tyranny it self in a neighboring kingdom has not been able to endure it as if the tyrant had looked upon it as an usurpation of his own tyrannical power that his slaves should have the lives of their fellowslaves at their mercy if any of our princes should have taken the life of a free born subject even upon the greatest provocation without process of law what a terrible outcry would that arbitrary proceeding have caused and yet a subject not only dares but thinks himself obliged to attempt the life of a fellowsubject on a foolish punctilio and on a senseless whimsey to what purpose is it to make wholesome laws for the security of property when life the very source and fountain of property is every moment in danger this parliament therefore has laid the greatest and highest obligation upon all their fellow subjects that man can lay upon man by rescuing them from the tyranny of a barbarous custom and making it scandalous to do that for the future which before twas infamous to refuse so that all their fellow subjects owe the security of their very being under god to them by how precarious and how fantastic a tenure has life been held till now when we were obliged to hazard it against all reason against all justice at the will of every contemptible wretch in order to preserve honor as if honor could be different from reason and justice and from the laws of our country with how much satisfaction do all who love that country see that though public spirit in other parts is sunk and fallen so low yet we may hope once more to see it rise since it still flourishes in the illustrious representative of the british nation whose members are so remarkable and several of them so renowned for their undaunted courage that malice it self must be obliged to own that there could be nothing private and nothing selfish in the inducement to this bill which could be introduced by nothing but that godlike motive of an universal good  an essay on public spirit etc chap i what the spirit of a man is to the body natural that public spirit is to the body politic when the spirit is vigorous for the most part the body is strong and healthful but the body decays when the spirit languishes and after it totally departs dissolves and returns into the elements from which it first was taken as a nation when that mighty spirit that animates it wholly fails returns into the mass of nations  since public spirit then is that by whose vigor states are strong and healthful and by whose languishment they decay nothing seems to me to be of more importance to the good of my country than a free and a bold enquiry what this public spirit is and in what condition it is at present among us  public spirit may be defined to be the ardent love of ones country affecting us with a zealous concern for its honor and interest and inspiring us with resolution and courage to promote its service and glory  since public spirit then is inseparable from the love of ones country we come now to enquire what it is to love ones country a bold and a dangerous inquisition which as it will distinguish public spirit from private interest or from vainglory will be to many a provoking satyr but those people who are engaged by their pride or their private interest to support the public liberty would do well to consider that they are obliged by the same interest to second and encourage any endeavor that is made toward the keeping up or restoring of public spirit it being certain that a general public spirit is the only solid basis of a national liberty and that wherever that spirit is not liberty is but by accident for interest may vary and pride may change its object but the love of our country become habituate and grown up with us from our infancy is always sure to remain  to love ones country then is not so much to be fond of ones soil or climate since whole nations have consented to leave those with the greatest alacrity the switzers in the time of julius caesar were resolved to leave their barren rocks for the fertile vales of the franche comte and the goths and vandals some ages after them forsook the horrid climate of the north for the lovely fields of italy both the one and the other rightly judging that where ever their fellowcitizens were there was likewise their country  to love ones country then is to love ones countrymen but he who loves his countrymen must love them for something that distinguishes them from other people for as he who loves his friend loves him for something which makes him that individual person so he who loves his countrymen loves them for something which makes them that peculiar nation  but that which makes a people that peculiar nation and distinguishes them from all other nations is their customs and manners he then who loves his countrymen loves their customs and manners thus the macedonians who with the most ardent alacrity left the sun and the soil of greece to follow their young hero rather chose to part with their lives than to forsake the manners of their country but as the more men are distinguished from other men by their manners the greater and the more extraordinary is the friendship that is professed between them the more a nation is distinguished by its manners from other nations the greater is the love of its children to it  and therefore the wisest of ancient lawgivers took care that the people of the commonwealths which they founded should be most illustriously distinguished from other nations by their customs and manners thus did moses thus did lycurgus distinguish the manners of the jews and spartans the customs and manners of the jews make a considerable part of the pentateuch and whole treatises have been writ of the manners of the lacedaemonians what they did for their real commonwealths plato did for his imaginary one plato in his laws says montaigne is of opinion that nothing could be more dangerous to the state which he founded than the granting license to the youth to alter their habits and change their gestures their dances their exercises and their music from one to another manner altering their judgments and their opinions sometimes one way and sometimes another running mad after novelties and doing honor and giving rewards to those who invent and who introduce them by which proceeding their manners are corrupted and their most ancient and sacred laws come to be disdained and contemned  it was the opinion of those ancient sages that the duration of that public spirit which they knew to be the soul of their various politic bodies depended upon the perpetuity of their customs and manners and indeed we find that the ruder nations have always conquered the more refined as the persians the assyrians the grecians the persians the romans the grecians and the goths and vandals the romans now the nations which we call rude are they which retain their old customs  since it appears from what has been said that public spirit flows from the love of ones country and that to love ones country is to love ones countrymen and that the greater affection any one has for his countrymen the fonder he must be of their peculiar customs and manners in order to show in what condition public spirit is at present among us we shall proceed to enquire into the difference between the manners of our ancestors and our own  but before we proceed to the foresaid enquiry it concerns us to answer an objection which is drawn from the very nature of public spirit and from the definition which has been given of it public spirit is the ardent love of ones country affecting us with a zealous concern for its honor and interest and inspiring us with resolution and courage to promote its service and glory now the nations retaining their primitive customs are rude and barbarous and by consequence weak obscure and miserable the grecians took their laws their learning and their philosophy in a great measure from the egyptians and the romans theirs from the grecians and we have taken our learning and philosophy from the romans and grecians now who can doubt but that that learning is at once our defense and ornament how could our navigation have risen to such a height our navigation upon which the honor and interest of this island depends but by the means of our mathematics which we have taken from the grecians and without which we could neither take our enemies towns nor fortify and defend our own  to which we answer  that it is impossible any reasonable doubt can be made but that a nation may take any thing from another that may improve their reason their virtue their interest and their power nay every nation is obliged by duty and by the dictates of public spirit to do this but the manners and customs of which we speak are such as distinguish one nation from another now as it is not reason that distinguishes one man from another for that is the same in all it cannot by consequence be reason that distinguishes one nation from another  that which most influences the generality of people and makes the greatest impression upon them is something which is the object of sense and the manners and customs of nations which we speak of are the objects of sense such as those which plato mentions viz their habits their motions their exercises and their dances  it is indeed our duty to emulate the virtue and knowledge of other nations but by imitating their manners which are the objects of sense we come to affect their vices and as every thing which is sensual takes off from that which is rational the aping their manners which are the objects of sense diverts us from imitating those good and those great qualities which may augment our reason and interest and reputation and power  but here another objection may be easily started for as to those manners and customs which are the objects of sense some may ask are we obliged to resume those of our ancestors and as to habits particularly would you advise us to follow the same form that was used in the beginning of henry the sevenths reign which time was before the great alteration of manners why no to advise that would be perhaps ridiculous but though i am not for resuming those of our ancestors why may we not as well now fix upon such as are proper and peculiar to us as we did in the time of king charles the second when in a general opposition to france we threw off their fashions and put on vests that we might look the more says the late lord hallifax like a distinct people and be no longer under the servility of imitation the whole passage is so very remarkable that the transcribing it cannot fail to inform and entertain the reader it is in the character of a trimmer written i suppose in the time of king charles the second  among the other means used for the attaining that end that is for the getting all flanders for the french the sending over the duchess of orleans was not the least powerful she was a very welcome guest here and her own charms and dexterity joined with other advantages that might help her pretensions gave her such an ascendant that she could hardly fail of success one of the preliminaries of her treaty though a trivial thing in it self yet was considerable in the consequence about this time a general humor in opposition to france had made us throw off their fashions and put on vests that we might look more like a distinct people and not be under the servility of imitation which ever pays a greater deference to the original than is consistent with the equality all independent nations should pretend to france did not like this beginning of ill humors at least of emulation as wisely considering that it is a natural introduction first to make the world their apes that they may afterward make them their slaves it was thought that one of the instructions that madam brought along with her was to laugh us out of these vests which she performed so effectually that in a moment like so many footmen who had quitted their masters livery we took it again and returned to our old service so that the very time of doing this gave a very critical advantage to france since it looked like an evidence of returning to their interests as well as to their fashions and would give such a distaste of us to our new allies that it might facilitate the dissolution of the knot which tied them so within their bounds that they were very impatient till they were freed from the restraint  thus far the late marquis of hallifax but now if the aping them in one of their habits was instrumental in producing so considerable an event as the breaking the triple league for that was the knot which his lordship speaks of an event which proved so detrimental to the peace and liberties of europe what must we not think of that load of foreign and particularly of french manners which have been introduced among us to the oppression of our own and the extinction of public spirit as we shall find in the following chapter  the end of the first chapter chap ii we come now to enquire into the difference that there is between the manners of our ancestors and our own as for example between the manners that were in the beginning of henry the sevenths reign and those of our own time we shall find that the difference is almost infinite for religion which never fails to influence all the manners though that of our forefathers was a great deal mistaken yet was it very sincere and consequently a great deal better than none and it was better for government of which religion is the first great hinge that they were very much mistaken in superstructures than if they had boldly and impiously struck at fundamentals as they were sincere in their religion they were sound in their morals the men were at once both just and generous sincere faithful laborious the women modest obedient chaste and diligent both men and women frugal liberal temperate hospitable their conversation and their diet were like their manners simple their conversation without fraud and their diet without artifice both their meat and their drink for the most part were of the native growth of their country and the costly juice of the grape was used oftener for physic than it was for pleasure they spent a great deal of their time in the country among their tenants to whom their hospitable houses were always open their tenants lived under them at easy rates they were the tutelary gods of the poor who in sickness had physic from them and in health their food and in both their habitations their way of living in the country their diet their air their economy and their rural diversions and exercises confirmed their healths and improved their estates and supplied them both with strength of body and with vigor of mind so that their minds were serene or their passions moderate their distempers neither frequent nor violent and their children healthful lively robust and nervous and whenever they unwillingly went to town the occasion was important and the stay was short and during their short continuance there they spent not their time in ignoble luxury or in mad profusion nor made themselves vile in the eyes of the world by frequenting houses of promiscuous assemblies their conversation lay for the most part with their equals both in birth and rank or with such as supplied the defect of those by true nobility of mind or if at any time upon the account of business or humor or variety they were familiar with their inferiors at the same time they took care to show that they knew how to descend with dignity their conversation was sincere and safe they were true to their friends and just to their enemies nor did they then as it were by consent by the means of false dice sophisticated wine and more impure adulterate friendship make war at one and the same time upon one anothers persons estates and reputations nor did they squander away their lives in thoughtless inglorious indolence they were always active for the good of others yes nobly active for the good of their country for which they were with so much zeal concerned that every person or thing was dear to them that could promote its honor or its real interest and every person or thing detestable that threatened danger or dishonor to it for this reason they were encouragers of learning and arts of the usefullest learning and the noblest arts for the promoting and spreading of which they founded colleges and erected schools but they had at the same time an extreme contempt for soft luxurious effeminate arts they had an utter abhorrence for foreign customs and foreign fashions and for those who introduced them and their habits and the rest of their customs and manners were such as very fairly distinguished their birth their age their sex and their country the generous youths were many of them in those days what the duke of argyle and sir richard temple are now they esteemed it infamous to lie idle at home while their country was in danger abroad and as soon as ever they became patient of arms they made their own laborious experience their chief instructor in war and placed their love and their chief delight rather in warlike steeds and in beautiful armor than in wanton strumpets and luxurious feasts therefore to men like these no labor was strange or hard no preparations of the enemy dreadful and no fortress impregnable their virtue was sufficient to conquer all the great contention among those britons was for glory and not for power who first should march to the assault who first should mount the breach who should have the most numerous spectators of their gallant actions here lay their strife these they accounted their most valued riches this their fame and this their high nobility liberal of wealth but usurers and extortioners of fame they were contented with honest fortunes but aspired to boundless glory who knows not what numerous armies of the french have formerly been overthrown by small handfuls of ancient britons our forefathers glory had transcended that of the ancient grecians had they like them found but historians equal to their actions but they who had the most capacity among them always were the most employed all exercised their bodies and their minds together and all the bravest and the best among them were less willing to relate the deeds of others than to have others immortalize their own and therefore both at home and abroad good manners were cultivated and as they had nothing of fordid interest there could be no faction among them but equity and virtue prevailed more among them by the force of nature than by the authority of law their quarrels and disputes were with the enemies of their country the sole contention that they had with their countrymen was who should be most virtuous and so by these two noble arts by intrepidity in war and by exact justice in peace they made themselves and the state illustrious  to paint the manners of our own times graphically in so little compass as that to which i have consigned my self would require a much greater master than ever i can pretend to be to say that the counterpart of what i have said of our ancestors is true of the manners of our own times is to say something but not the hundredth part of what the subject will bear these manners are so various so complicated so prodigious that one might compile volumes of them there is not a greater difference between what london was in harry the eighths time and what it is at present than there is between the manners of our ancestors and our own this overgrown town may be said to be a visible palpable proof of the growth of the british luxury  for religion never was there so much of it in talk never so little of it in fact ten thousand people make it their pretext who are the most extraordinary hypocrites that ever were in the world for while they make it their pretext they neither care for it nor would be thought to care for it at the same time that they pretend to contend for the purity of it they openly maintain and avow principles that are destructive of the fundamentals of it and are so far from concealing the lewdness of their practice that they make their daily boast of it this was not all for the christian religion the very spirit and being of which lies in charity and the effects of it humility meekness selfdenial concord unity was made the pretext for the utter subversion of all these and setting up in their stead hatred malice rage violence tumult riot rebellion confusion anarchy which are contrary to the very soul and being of all christianity and what appears more incredible than all the rest it has been reported that a great many persons of condition have made it their business to ridicule and baffle the christian religion and to introduce deism though nothing is more plain than that to extinguish revealed religion is to introduce anarchy for there never was from the beginning of the world to this day any manner of government without revelation pretended or true and never can be as long as the world endures the established religion which is the first great mover of the public manners being in this condition the latter must needs be in a deplorable state  ex divitiis  says sallust juventutem luxuria atque avaritia cum superbia invasere rapere consumere sua parvi pendere aliena cupere where by the way we may see that st evremont was mistaken when he speaks of the alieni appetens sui profusus as an extraordinary singular turn and double in catilines nature for sallust affirms the very same thing of all the roman youth that he does of catiline rapere consumere sua parvi pendere aliena cupere riches made them proud and luxurious luxury made them necessitous and necessity base and venal  pride luxury and avarice the legitimate offspring of selflove which is private spirit and which are the first causes of all mutation of manners have made such a dismal havoc in ours that we have hardly any remains of those of our forefathers pride makes our gentry hate and detest solitude as where they have no opportunity to set themselves to show and drives them from the country to crowds and numerous assemblies where instead of courting true glory by heroic actions abroad or by wholesome british councils at home many of them endeavor to distinguish themselves by parties and study faction and division in order to arrive at power for to speak freely and impartially the persons who during these late years have made most tumult and most stir in the state some to assert the prerogative of the crown and the authority of the church others to secure equal impartial liberty to the people have all to the reserve of a very few under the shelter of these specious pretexts contended for their own power  others of our gentry who have left their hereditary seats in the country to establish themselves in town have endeavored to distinguish themselves and to outvie one another by their foppish profusion in eating drinking dress and equipage as if honor were to be acquired by shaking hands with reason and with common sense and the more extravagant the vanity of our modern fops has been the more they have thought to grow remarkable by extraordinary trifles and the more fond have they been of introducing novelties and because they themselves have been something dull of invention they have most humbly condescended to borrow from their mortal enemies and have valued themselves upon french habits french dishes and french dances as sir martin does upon his mans voice and music  since then public spirit flows from the love of ones country and to love ones country is to love the manners of it it is manifest that we can have very little public spirit among us for we have no manners of our own to love our manners are those of all the neighboring nations and whereas it was formerly a part of the roman wisdom whenever they gave to other people the right of roman citizens to oblige them to throw off their old customs and become conformable to theirs we at a time of general naturalization are throwing off the very remains of our old customs and embracing those of all the nations whom we design to receive  methinks it should mortify all those who pretend to distinguish themselves by introducing such empty trifles among us to consider what is become of those who were at the head of the fashions and customs thirty years ago are they not as much forgot nay are they not more than jowler and rockwood and ringwood that lead the duke of yorks foxhounds then  but luxury which began by pride grew habitual by length of time and was then improved by sensual pleasures to an amazing height  there would be no end of enumerating the several wines which we use to debauch us or the various dishes or their unnatural mixtures or their high aromatic sauces those fierce incendiaries of the blood and spirits the romans in the times of their corrupted manners equaled us perhaps in these but we are not contented as they were of old to rifle the earth the air and the sea to advance our sensual pleasures we have raised recruits from the very fire and made even that devouring element that in the time of our forefathers consumed all but produced nothing fertile of a thousand luxuries witness our brandy our usquebaughs our rosa solis our ratifias and all the family of destructive spirits these multitudes of people constantly use to invigorate themselves not considering that nature vigorous and undebauchd draws the best and the noblest spirits from the simplest liquors and the best and the most congenial of all from water for she like some other mechanics operates best with her own instruments and uses but aukwardly those of art  but these spirits are grown as habitual to the women as they are to the men in whose tender constitutions they raise fierce ebullitions and violent emotions too rude for the delicate texture of their fibers and for half the year together they neither take any air nor use any exercise to remove them from hence distempers of body and mind from hence an infinity of irregular desires unlawful amors intrigues and vapors and whimsies and all the numerous melancholy crowd of deep hysterical symptoms from hence it comes to pass that the fruit of their bodies lies in them like plants in hot beds from hence it proceeds that our british maids who in the times of our henrys were not held marriageable till turned of twenty are now become falling ripe at twelve forced to prematureness by the heat of adventitious fire  thus has our luxury changed our natures in despite of our climate and our girls are ripe as soon as those of the indies nor has it only changed our natures but transformed our sexes we have men that are more soft more languid and more passive than women men who like women are come to use red and white and part of the nation are turning picts again on the other side we have women who as it were in revenge are masculine in their desires and masculine in their practices yes we have vices which we dare not name though after the great apostle of the gentiles and to mention which with an open frankness would require the boldness of a perfect saint or an accomplished libertine  few constitutions and fewer estates are sufficient to such luxury yet happy were men if the want of money could mortify or subdue their boundless desires such a victory were cheaply purchased at the expense of ruin but the mischief is that when the habit of luxury is grown inveterate indigence does but exasperate desire and desire makes indigence insupportable and therefore a person who has a thousand a year and who yet cannot live under two or three thousand is ten times more unhappy and has ten times more want than an honest beggar who could live contentedly on twenty and therefore this latter does only beg while the other too frequently robs and steals not indeed from particular persons because that cannot be done without danger of infamy or of corporal punishment but from the public without any reluctance where though perhaps the danger to himself may be a thousand times less the guilt and the mischief are a thousand times greater thus private lusts are too often supported by public frauds and rapines and the supporting of these makes him who before he consumed his estate retained his honor and his integrity fraudulent venal rapacious cruel oppressive this makes him rack and grind his tenants and dispossess his insolvent debtors seizing at once upon body and goods to the irrecoverable ruin of themselves and their families without compassion or consideration of their deplorable and inevitable misfortunes and this inhumanity perhaps is shown not to get money to discharge his lawful debts but to satisfy forsooth his debts of honor which by being preferably paid to the other are changed to debts of infamy this sets him upon enclosing commons where buying out the rights of the rich and powerful he tramples upon the necks of the poor and impotent and throws them out of their ancient dwellings by violence while the wretched inhabitant grows abandoned helpless and spiritless and only fit for servitude it is this that obliges him to let out his estate to monopolizers who are capable of advancing large sums to supply his profusions one of which monopolizers perhaps shall rent two thousand pounds per annum all which land perhaps being grazed is managed by a few servants that formerly maintained no less than forty families and this one tenant has been known to be a notorious papist who has sold his hereditary estate and entered upon this new commerce to avoid the paying of double taxes and to elude the power of the laws  it is nothing but want occasioned by luxury that has raised gaming to such a height that it has done more mischief than a plague for the latter only consumes the present people whose kind is immortal and therefore must spring up again but the universal extravagance of gaming disorders the very form and being of government especially when it is carried on with such a rage that neither sex sets any bounds to it but men and women in the fury of their passion loose all government and all decorum the men forget their birth their rank their dignity their understanding their virtue and herd and converse with mean wretches who are often both fools and knaves men of the first quality keep worse company than prince harry does in shakespeares play as a pickpocket is more scandalous than a highwayman it is wonderful to see people live so much above themselves and keep company so much below themselves to see so much pride with so little subordination  the women lock themselves up at cards whole days and nights successively and forget their natural pleasure of being seen and of being admired and avarice gets the better of their pride as luxury in some of them had done before and gets the better of their pleasure likewise gets the better of that pleasure which is so natural to them and makes them show a stronger passion than that which they have for men yet avarice that drew them from their natural desires sometimes brings them back again and some of them like the ancient germans play for their persons after they have lost their pelf  while both sexes are thus transported by so fatal a frenzy where can be any economy and without economy how few can be good subjects great estates are often consumed in a little time while avarice and profusion pride and baseness walk hand in hand together and want springs up from the desire of getting but by the same degrees that a man grows indigent at home he often grows clamorous and turbulent in the state for none are more clamorous than they who under a pretense of public good are striving for power and place and none more eagerly contend for power than they who are urged by their pressing necessities to make their markets of the state  but of all the fashions that have been introduced among us from abroad none shows so deplorable a want of public spirit as the italian opera and the extravagant encouragement that upon the account of that is at the expense of all that is good and great among us given to worthless fools who can pretend to no merit but sound i had once an intention of inserting a long discourse of it here but i have omitted the greater part of it out of fear of offending some persons for whom i have conceived a more than ordinary esteem and who are truly estimable they have indeed such good and such great qualities and which shine so truly bright that they want not the foil of this senseless encouragement to set them off to the world how much it is to be lamented that the pressure of their affairs their itch of novelty and their pride of showing their power at too precious an expense diverts them from considering the harm which they do both to themselves and the public and from reflecting on that specious pretense which they give to their enemies to call in question their very wisdom that wisdom which even their enemies allow to be so conspicuous in the rest of their actions the prosperity of the bad say they and the sufferings of the good have made millions doubt of providence when they who by their quality their rank or their fortunes influence and support the pleasures of the town when these discourage merit and encourage fools may we not believe say they that they are rather governed by fancy and by humor than by reason must we not admire say they the profoundness of these gentlemens politics when we see them forsaking their most serious affairs for a wanton and a sensual trifle so unworthy of their gravity their rank and their dignity that it is not worthy of men manly pleasures are rational pleasures mere sensual pleasures are common to beasts with men the pleasure that effeminate music gives is a mere sensual pleasure which he who gives or he who receives in a supreme degree must be alike unmannd a musical voice is natural only to some species of birds but always accidental to men for which reason a cock nightinghale sings better than nicolini nay or than syphace himself could without being taught or without being gelt for the matter and there is a better opera in a kentish grove in the month of april than ever there was at rome at naples or at venice do not the politics of these gentlemen say they turn mr bayss politics out of ridicule for is not the conduct of the two kings of brentford become as it were a precedent to some of our modern politicians with what countenance can they hereafter laugh when they hear the brother monarchs say as they descend from the cloud    k come now to serious counsel well advance   k i do agree but first let us have a dance for can any one say they give a tolerable reason why a dance is not as proper a preparation for council as a song but mr bayss politicians only proceeded from dance to council and there was an end of the matter our modern politicians advance from song to serious council and from serious council before it is half ended to song again and so have made it their business of late years to refine upon mr bayss politics  where say their enemies is the love which these gentlemen bear to their country that love which has been so much boasted of and when here we urge in their behalf the important services which they have done for it to this their enemies reply that they own indeed that they have done their country important services but that therefore they truly love their country is not a good conclusion a man say they may do another very signal service and may do it heartily not because he loves that other man but because it is his interest to serve him heartily for say they there are these following remarkable differences between true friendship and a commerce of interest    a true friend loves the manners of his friend   he loves those who are friends to his friend   he hates his friends enemies   he appears zealous on all occasions for his friends reputation and interest to which he never fails to sacrifice both his interest and his pleasure   he delights to hear of the good qualities of his friend and hates to hear of his defects on the contrary it is a sure sign say they of a commerce of interest    when a man appears to be so far from loving the manners of his friend that he plainly shows a disgust to them and affects those of his friends enemy   when he neglects those who are dear to his friend and does good to his friends enemies   when in some things he discovers a great indifference as to what concerns the interest or the reputation of his friend   when he delights to hear of his friends defects and appears to be not at all affected with his good and his great qualities   when he appears to be more touched with the most trifling advantages of his friends enemies than with the most glorious accomplishments of his friend   when he never fails to sacrifice his friend to his humor or his pleasure but now say they let us consider the management of these gntlemen who have introduced the opera among us and who have encouraged it at this extravagant rate the introducing of other foreign customs among us proceeded as it were from a combination of all sorts of people but a few have introduced the opera in despite and contempt of the rest if these gentlemen love their country why do they sacrifice its interest and reputation for a song why do they sacrifice these noble arts which may bring profit and renown to it to inglorious ones which threaten it with danger and infamy what article has music in the grecian and roman greatness what has it in our own when they have answered themselves let them give themselves so much trouble as to look into bayles historical dictionary which is now spread throughout europe let them see there how much of the british greatness is owing to these noble arts which they have banished for so wanton a trifle that it is hardly fit for a womans toy  since the opera in so short a time has made the old british wit a jest what security have we that in twenty years more it will not make the old british courage a jest likewise it has already had that effect in italy and perhaps in france too in some degree and nothing is more plain than that effeminacy is much more compatible with wit than it is with courage now is not the opera say they an effeminate trifle has it not wherever it comes emasculated the minds of men and corrupted their manners has it not made good the accusations of plato and cicero why then if these gentlemen love their country do they encourage that which corrupts their countrymen and makes them degenerate from themselves so much if they are so fond of the italian music why do they not take it from the haymarket to their houses and hug it like their secret sins there why do they abuse the queens authority to enervate and debanch her people and to discourage her subjects so contrary to her majestys royal intention and the express words of her license where say they is the gratitude and justice of preferring foreigners to britons and in a time of a deplorable war their enemies to their countrymen is there not an implicit contract between all the people of every nation to espouse one anothers interest against all foreigners whatsoever but would not any one swear to observe the conduct of these persons that they were protected by italians in their liberty their property and their religion against britons for why else should they prefer italian sound to british sense italian nonsense to british reason the blockheads of italy to their own countrymen who have wit and the luxury and effeminacy of the most profligate portion of the globe to the british virtue why do those exotic worthless wretches fare deliciously every day and sleep in purple at night while our own proficients in more generous arts of arts which alone can worthily celebrate the glories of our country and the triumphs of the queens victorious reign are suffered to be reduced to the basest want a play say they is the imitation of human life in order to its improvement and yet that is an art which is about to be lost among us but what is an opera it is so foolish a thing that it is impossible to give a serious description of it it is the imitation or rather the burlesque of catterwawling where love and battle are waged together with a perpetual squawling and yet this is the thing that is so much encouraged o noble encouragement what say they can they answer to this but that they are pleased with the opera and that they are resolved to sacrifice all things to their own pleasure even the honor and interest of their country now can any thing in the world show a more deplorable want of public spirit than this though there was little of it in the nation before yet many people showed so much esteem for it at least to pretend to it but these persons by such a declaration manifestly boast of the want of it they boldly confess that they are not concerned for the interest and honor of their country and so prevail upon all those who can be influenced by their example to throw off any concern for it  i am sorry that these gentlemen should have given their enemies the specious pretexts to make objections like these i can only say in defense of some of them what is known to all europe that not only the services which they have done the common cause have been most conspicuous and most illustrious but that they appeared so early in the defense of their country and at a time when they had nothing but ruin to expect from their zeal that it was undeniably their love to their country and not their interest which engaged them in the defense of it this i can say in the behalf of three or four espousers of the opera and i could wish the few deserving rest would apologize for themselves  but for the numerous herd of its encouragers who have not the least pretense to merit i would not have them think that any part of the preceding discourse is addressed to them they are persons whom it is very easy to contemn but very hard to satisfy and least of all with reason it is their interest that the reigning diversion of the town should be that of which they are often better qualified to judge than they are who have understanding they are not only pleased with the opera forsooth they value themselves upon it as their brother sir martin did upon his mans voice and music if they were the only persons concerned i believe no one would give himself a moments trouble to put them out of conceit with themselves and with their darling bawble a rattle of one sort or other is as necessary to keep fools in order as it is children and therefore let them even go on to be used as they have been that is like so many bartlemew cockess to have the eunuchs tickle their ears with a straw while they pick their pockets  the ladies with humblest submission seem to mistake their interest a little in encouraging operas for the more the men are enervated and emasculated by the softness of the italian music the less will they care for them and the more for one another there are some certain pleasures which are mortal enemies to their pleasures that past the alps about the same time with the opera and if our subscriptions go on at the frantic rate that they have done i make no doubt but we shall come to see one beau take another for better for worse as once an imperial harmonious blockhead did sporus  if any one thinks i have been too severe let him only consider what shakespeare would have said if he had been now alive he had not the thousandth part of the provocation that we have and yet he could not forbear crying out as it were with a prophetic spirit   then there are found lascivious metres to whose venom sound the open ears of youth do always listen report of fashions in proud italy whose manners still our tardy apish nation limps after in base imitation and thus we have gone through this draught of the public manners which is very far from being writ with malice or being designed a libel upon the british nation he who wrote it loves his country too well for that and if he believes the manners of our britons corrupt he believes those of some southern nations to be still more degenerate but they have already lost their liberty by their corruption ours is yet entire and in no danger at present and it is possible for us if we will mend our manners to transmit it to our latest posterity  however if i have either exaggerated any thing or in some particulars have been my self mistaken or have been wrongly informed by others i hope the reader will pardon my errors for the sake of my good intention for this being a general satyr he who wrote it cannot be supposed to act by malice or passion those satyrs indeed which descend to mention particular persons under pretense of reforming the public often attack those particular persons and sometimes the very ministers out of malice or passion or interest but no man can bear malice against a nation or be angry with a world he who wrote this is a hearty lover of his country but we have shown above that he who loves his country loves his countrymen all his countrymen for he who pretends to affect a part only loves only himself  as he who wrote this loves his country he will be pleased with any administration under which it flourishes he is very far from having any reason to be angry with the ministers nor if he had would he suffer his passion to get the better of his reason but would let his private resentment be lost in the public tranquillity and his private sufferings in the happiness of his country  nor are here any bitter envenomed reflections upon private particular persons to ruin their reputations and undermine their interests he who writes this looks upon himself as one who has neither mission nor authority to expose any one to public censure nor can any thing excuse the doing it but a certainty that the public will suffer if it is not done  as this is a general satyr and cannot be the effect either of passion or malice a general benefit must be the chief design of it the good which it carries with it is equally intended to all even those who happen to be hit by it are designed to be obliged among the rest and suffer only by accident  and it is for this very reason that a general satyr is preferable to what is particular not only because the design is more generous of obliging all and offending none but because there is a greater probability of its attaining the end to which it directs its aim which is the reformation of the reader for the pleasure which we find that the generality of mankind takes in particular satyr is a certain sign that the public reaps little benefit from it for few are willing to apply those faults to themselves for which they see any particular person exposed to contempt and infamy men will more willingly acknowledge faults in the committing which they are joined with company sufficient to keep them in countenance  yet are particular satyrs if they are just satyrs preferable by much to lampoons or libels that only can be called a just satyr whose censures are always true but that which endeavors to decry true merit out of malice or passion or interest is in spite of popular applause a lampoon and an infamous libel  yet several lampoons both in verse and in prose are writ with wit and art and these are much better than those thousand extempore ones which are hourly uttered by club and coffeehouse gentlemen petty merchants of small conceits as my late lord hallifax calls them who says he are always aiming at wit and generally make false fire  though perhaps no one is more truly pleased by the charms of a beautiful imagination than my self yet i have always been of opinion that there is no one quality of a human mind that makes a man a more impertinent extravagant blockhead than that which they call wit when it is not corrected by good sense and restrained by judgment as a dose of mercury uncorrected and unfixd naturally causes driveling and that which they call wit in conversation without good sense and without judgment is generally without good nature likewise and vents it self in slander  slander is a vice which is mightily in vogue at present a spurious brat begot by pride upon malice so lusty and vigorous a bastard that it often thrives by the same means which are used to destroy it  as it is begot clandestinely it is nursed for a time as secretly till it comes at last to be openly maintained by the parish it is a creature of which they who begot it are afraid or ashamed while they who maintain it are both proud and fond of it till like the young cuckoo brought up by the hedgesparrow it comes to prey on its fosterfather  it is the universal corruption of manners that makes this vice so current it is that which recommends pitiful vile mechanics to persons of rank and quality recommends even wretches who have no accomplishment either of art or nature and who are distinguished by nothing but their being universal talebearers and public scavengers of scandal  si nous n avions pas des defauts nous ne trouverions pas tant de pain a en trouver dans les autres if we were without faults our selves we should not take so much pains as we do to find others out in them for as stocks are jobbd by people in the city who have no real stock but their impudence so slander is chiefly carried on in the suburbs by people who have no reputation themselves and never can have any by wretches who are not only below fame but infamy by those who will no more be remembered three days after they are dead than flies of the last season and as if a design were set on foot for levelling estates all the beggars in the nation would come the soonest into it and be the deepest concerned in it so in this project for levelling reputations the scum and offscouring of things is most deeply engaged  to degrade merit is their principal aim for we have a kind of ostracism for reputations established by implicit consent among us and nothing is more dangerous than to be too deserving and no desert is become more unpardonable than that of the man who does great services to the public so that a briton who does great and public actions must have a more than roman spirit for romans who acted for the good of their country recommended themselves to romans but britons who have done most for the good of their country have made thousands of their countrymen their irreconcilable enemies  this vice is chiefly carried on by wretches who are so worthless and so thoughtless that they have neither sense nor thought to consider that to bark at objects sublime and illustrious is the quality of a dog and a slanderer that to call a man knave or fool makes him neither but if he is neither it makes him who calls him so most emphatically one or the other that slander is grown so fashionable and so frequent that it does not always hurt the slandered but that in the opinion of a man of common sense it always hurts the slanderer that it can only be the interest of men who want common honesty and of such who seem to be sent into the world on purpose to be the tools of these but that it is the undoubted interest of all men of honor and of merit to defend the slandered  that he who slanders any one wants not only common honesty but even common courage the first because he condemns a man whom he does not know to be guilty the second because he basely murders a mans reputation behind his back when it is not in his power to defend himself if a judge should condemn any one to die without positive proof or most convincing presumption and especially without hearing him what a dreadful outcry would that formal murder occasion how detestable then are they who upon the most frivolous appearances condemn and execute as far as in them lies the reputations of their dearest friends and acquaintance those reputations which are dearer to every good man even than life it self  thus much to the men whose business it is to carry on so odious a vice i am sorry that it is requisite to say a word to the women who by being instrumental in carrying on this vice against the men have often given too provoking occasions for terrible retalations now slander bears infinitely more hard upon a woman than it can do upon a man for a man may retrieve the reputation of his courage his justice his honor or his estate but a woman may as soon recover her lost maidenhead as her lost reputation  in fine as the foundation both of inventing and of spreading slander is in the corrupted manners of him who invents or propagates it it follows that slander being now almost universal and raging in all its height the corruption of manners must be likewise almost universal and at its greatest height  thus have we endeavored to lay before the reader a draught of the manners of these times and to place it in as true a light as we could that the reader being convinced that public spirit depends upon the public manners and that we have lost the manners of our ancestors without making choice of any others peculiar to us and that we have introduced into this island all manner of foreign customs and foreign luxury may likewise be satisfied that there is very little public spirit among us  finis books lately printed for bernard lintott a
