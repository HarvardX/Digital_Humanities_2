the ghost by c churchill book iii  london printed for the author and sold by william flexney near graysinn gate holborn mdcclxii  the ghost book iii it was the hour when huswife morn with pearl and linen hangs each thorn when happy bards who can regale their muse with country air and ale ramble afield to brooks and bowers to pick up sentiments and flowers when dogs and squires from kennel fly and hogs and farmers quit their stye when my lord rises to the chase and brawny chaplain takes his place these images or bad or good if they are rightly understood sagacious readers must allow proclaim us in the country now for observations mostly rise from objects just before our eyes and every lord in critic wit can tell you where the piece was writ can point out as he goes along and who shall dare to say he is wrong whether the warmth for bards we know at present never more than glow was in the town or country caught by the peculiar turn of thought it was the hour  though critics frown we now declare ourselves in town nor will a moments pause allow for finding when he came or how the man who deals in humble prose tied down by rule and method goes but they who court the vigorous muse their carriage have a right to choose free as the air and unconfined swift as the motions of the mind the poet darts from place to place and instant bounds over time and space nature whilst blended fire and skill inflame our passions to his will smiles at her violated laws and crowns his daring with applause should there be still some rigid few who keep propriety in view whose heads turn round and cannot bear this whirling passage through the air free leave have such at home to sit and write a regimen for wit to clip our pinions let them try not having heart themselves to fly it was the hour when devotees breathe pious curses on their knees when they with prayers the day begin to sanctify a night of sin when rogues of modesty who roam under the veil of night sneak home that free from all restraint and awe just to the windward of the law less modest rogues their tricks may play and plunder in the face of day but hold  whilst thus we play the fool in bold contempt of every rule things of no consequence expressing describing now and now digressing to the discredit of our skill the main concern is standing still in plays indeed when storms of rage tempestuous in the soul engage or when the spirits weak and low are sunk in deep distress and woe with strict propriety we hear description stealing on the ear and put off feeling half an hour to thatch a cot or paint a flower but in these serious works designed to mend the morals of mankind we must for ever be disgraced with every nicer son of taste if once the shadow to pursue we let the substance out of view our means must uniformly tend in due proportion to their end and every passage aptly join to bring about the one design our friends themselves cannot admit this rambling wild digressive wit no  not those very friends who found their credit on the selfsame ground peace my good grumbling sir  for once sunk in the solemn formal dunce this coxcomb shall your fears beguile  we will be dull  that you may smile come method come in all thy pride dullness and whitehead by thy side dullness and method still are one and whitehead is their darling son not he whose pen above control struck terror to the guilty soul made folly tremble through her state and villains blush at being great but he who in the laureat chair by grace not merit planted there in awkward pomp is seen to sit and by his patent proves his wit for favors of the great we know can wit as well as rank bestow and they who without one pretension can get for fools a place or pension must able be supposed of course if reason is allowed due force to give such qualities and grace as may equip them for the place but he  who measures as he goes a mongril kind of tinkling prose and is too frugal to dispense at once both poetry and sense who from amidst his slumbering guards deals out a charge to subject bards where couplets after couplets creep propitious to the reign of sleep yet every word imprints an awe and all his dictates pass for law with beaux who simper all around and belles who die in every sound for in all things of this relation men mostly judge from situation nor in a thousand find we one who really weighs what is said or done they deal out censure or give credit merely from him who did or said it but he  who happily serene means nothing yet would seem to mean who rules and cautions can dispense with all that humble insolence which impudence in vain would teach and none but modest men can reach who adds to sentiments the grace of always being out of place and drawls out morals with an air a gentleman would blush to wear who on the chastest simplest plan as chaste as simple as the man without or character or plot nature unknown and art forgot can with much racking of the brains and years consumed in lettered pains an heap of words together lay and smirking call the thing a play who champion sworn in virtues cause against vice his tiny bodkin draws but to no part of prudence stranger first blunts the point for fear of danger so nurses sage as caution works when children first use knives and forks for fear of mischief it is known to others fingers or their own to take the edge off wisely choose though the same stroke takes off the use thee whitehead thee i now invoke sworn foe to satyrs generous stroke which makes unwilling conscience feel and wounds but only wounds to heal goodnatured easy creature mild and gentle as a newborn child thy heart would never once admit even wholesome rigor to thy wit thy head if conscience should comply its kind assistance would deny and lend thee neither force nor art to drive it onward to the heart o may thy sacred power control each fiercer working of my soul damp every spark of genuine fire and languors like thine own inspire trite be each thought and every line as moral and as dull as thine poised in midair  it matters not to ascertain the very spot nor yet to give you a relation how it eluded gravitation  hung a watchtowr  by vulcan pland with such rare skill by joves command that every word which whispered here scarce vibrates to the neighbor ear on the still bosom of the air is borne and heard distinctly there the palace of an ancient dame whom men as well as gods call fame a prattling gossip on whose tongue proof of perpetual motions hung whose lungs in strength all lungs surpass like her own trumpet made of brass who with an hundred pair of eyes the vain attacks of sleep defies who with an hundred pair of wings news from the farthest quarters brings sees hears and tells untold before all that she knows and ten times more not all the virtues which we find concentered in a hunters mind can make her spare the rancrous tale if in one point she chance to fail or if once in a thousand years a perfect character appears such as of late with joy and pride my soul possessed ere a  died or such as envy must allow the world enjoys in h  now this hag who aims at all alike at virtues even like theirs will strike and make faults in the way of trade when she cannot find them ready made all things she takes in small and great talks of a toyshop and a state of wits and fools of saints and kings of garters stars and leadingstrings of old lords fumbling for a clap and young ones full of prayer and pap of courts of morals and tyewigs of bears and sergeants dancing jigs of grave professors at the bar learning to thrum on the guittar whilst laws are slubberd over in haste and judgment sacrificed to taste of whited sepulchers lawn sleeves and gods house made a den of thieves of funeral pomps where clamours hung and fixed disgrace on every tongue whilst sense and order blushed to see nobles without humanity of coronations where each heart with honest raptures bore a part of city feasts where elegance was proud her colors to advance and gluttony uncommon case could only get the second place of newraised pillars in the state who must be good as being great of shoulders on which honors sit almost as clumsily as wit of doughty knights whom titles please but not the payment of the fees of lectures whither every fool in second childhood goes to school of gray beards deaf to reasons call from inn of court or city hall whom youthful appetites enslave with one foot fairly in the grave by help of crutch a needful brother learning of heart to dance with the other of doctors regularly bred to fill the mansions of the dead of quacks for quacks they must be still who save when forms require to kill who life and health and vigor give to him not one would wish to live of artists who

fitter time the muse shall consecrate in rhyme who humble artists to out do a far more liberal plan pursue and let their welljudgd premiums fall on those who have no worth at all of signpost exhibitions raised for laughter more than to be praised though by the way we cannot see why praise and laughter may not agree where genuine humor runs to waste and justly chides our want of taste censured like other things though good because they are not understood to higher subjects now she soars and talks of politics and whores if to your nice and chaster ears that term indelicate appears scripture politely shall refine and melt it into concubine in the same breath spreads bourbons league and publishes the grand intrigue in brussels or our own gazette makes armies fight which never met and circulates the pox or plague to london by the way of hague for all the lies which there appear stamped with authority come here borrows as freely from the gabble of some rude leader of a rabble or from the quaint harangues of those who lead a nation by the nose as from those storms which void of art burst from our honest patriots heart when eloquence and virtue late remarked to live in mutual hate fond of each others friendship grown claim every sentence for their own and with an equal joy recites parade amors and halfpay fights performed by heroes of fair weather merely by dint of lace and feather as those rare acts which honor taught our daring sons where granby fought or those which with superior skill   achieved by standing still this hag the curious if they please may search from earliest times to these and poets they will always see with gods and goddesses make free treating them all except the muse as scarcely fit to wipe their shoes who had beheld from first to last how our triumvirate had passed nights dreadful interval and heard with strict attention every word soon as she saw return of light on sounding pinions took her flight swift through the regions of the sky above the reach of human eye onward she drove the furious blast and rapid as a whirlwind past over countries once the seats of taste by time and ignorance laid waste over lands where former ages saw reason and truth the only law where arts and arms and public love in generous emulation strove where kings were proud of legal sway and subjects happy to obey though now in slavery sunk and broke to superstitions galling yoke of arts of arms no more they tell or freedom which with science fell by tyrants awed who never find the passage to their peoples mind to whom the joy was never known of planting in the heart their throne far from all prospect of relief their hours in fruitless prayers and grief for loss of blessings they employ which we unthankfully enjoy now is the time had we the will tamaze the readers with our skill to pour out such a flood of knowledge as might suffice for a whole college whilst with a true poetic force we traced the goddess in her course sweetly describing in our flight each common and uncommon sight making our journal gay and pleasant with things long past and things now present rivers  once nymphs  a transformation is mighty pretty in relation from great authorities we know will matter for a tale bestow to make the observation clear we give our friends an instance here the day that never is forgot was very fine but very hot the nymph another general rule enflamed with heat laid down to cool her hair we no exceptions find waved careless floating in the wind her heaving breasts like summer seas seemed amorous of the playful breeze should fond description tune our lays in choicest accents to her praise description we at last should find baffled and weak would halt behind nature had formed her to inspire in every bosom soft desire passions to raise she could not feel wounds to inflict she would not heal a god his name is no great matter perhaps a jove perhaps a satyr raging with lust a godlike flame by chance as usual thither came with gloting eyes the fair one viewed desired her first and then pursued she for what other can she do must fly  or how can he pursue the muse so custom has decreed now proves her spirit by her speed nor must one limping line disgrace the life and vigor of the race she runs and he runs till at length quite destitute of breath and strength to heaven for there we all apply for help when there is no other nigh she offers up her virgin prayer can virgins pray unpitied there and when the god thinks he has caught her slips through his hands and runs to water becomes a stream in which the poet if he has any wit may show it a city once for power renowned now levelled even to the ground beyond all doubt is a direction to introduce some fine reflection ah woeful me ah woeful man ah woeful all do all we can who can on earthly things depend from one to the other moments end honor wit genius wealth and glory good lack good lack are transitory nothing is sure and stable found the very earth itself turns round monarchs nay ministers must die must rot must stink  ah me ah why cities themselves in time decay if cities thus  ah welladay if brick and mortar have an end on what can flesh and blood depend ah woeful me ah woeful man ah woeful all do all we can england for that is at last the scene though worlds on worlds should rise between whither we must our course pursue england should call into review times long since past indeed but not by englishmen to be forgot though england once so dear to fame sinks in great britains dearer name here could we mention chiefs of old in plain and rugged honor bold to virtue kind to vice severe strangers to bribery and fear who kept no wretched clans in awe who never broke or warped the law patriots whom in her better days old rome might have been proud to raise who steady to their countrys claim boldly stood up in freedoms name even to the teeth of tyrant pride and when they could no more they died there striking contrast might we place a servile mean degenerate race hirelings who valued naught but gold by the best bidder bought and sold truants from honors sacred laws betrayers of their countrys cause the dupes of party tools of power slaves to the minion of an hour lacquies who watched a favorites nod and took a puppet for their god sincere and honest in our rimes how might we praise these happier times how might the muse exalt her lays and wanton in a monarchs praise tell of a prince in england born whose virtues englands crown adorn in youth a pattern unto age so chaste so pious and so sage who true to all those sacred bands which private happiness demands yet never let us them rise above the stronger ties of public love with conscious pride see england stand our holy charter in her hand she waves it round and over the isle see liberty and courage smile no more she mourns her treasures hurled in subsidies to all the world no more by foreign threats dismayed no more deceived with foreign aid she deals out sums to petty states whom honor scorns and reason hates but wiser by experience grown finds safety in herself alone whilst thus she cries my children stand an honest valiant native band a trained militia brave and free true to their king and true to me no foreign hirelings shall be known nor need we hirelings of our own under a just and pious reign the statesmans sophistry is vain vain is each vile corrupt pretense these are my natural defense their faith i know and they shall prove the bulwark of the king they love these and a thousand things beside did we consult a poets pride some gay some serious might be said but ten to one they would not be read or were they by some curious few not even those would think them true for from the time that jubal first sweet ditties to the harp rehearsed poets have always been suspected of having truth in rhyme neglected that bard except who from his youth equally famed for faith and truth by prudence taught in courtly chime to courtly ears brought truth in rhyme but though to poets we allow no matter when acquired or how from truth unbounded deviation which custom calls imagination yet cannot they be supposed to lie one half so fast as fame can fly therefore to solve this gordian knot a point we almost had forgot to courteous readers be it known that fond of verse and falsehood grown whilst we in sweet digression sung fame checked her flight and held her tongue and now pursues with double force and double speed her destined course nor stops till she the place arrives where genius starves and dullness thrives where riches virtue are esteemed and craft is truest wisdom deemed where commerce proudly rears her throne in state to other lands unknown where to be cheated and to cheat strangers from every quarter meet where christians jews and turks shake hands united in commercial bands all of one faith and that to own no god but interest alone when gods and goddesses come down to look about them here in town for change of air is understood by sons of physic to be good in due proportions now and then for these same gods as well as men by custom ruled and not a poet so very dull but he must know it in order to remain incog they always travel in a fog for if we majesty expose to vulgar eyes too cheap it grows the force is lost and free from awe we spy and censure every flaw but well preserved from public view it

lazy lounging pampered priest well known at every city feast for he was seen much oftner there than in the house of god at prayer who always ready in his place never let gods creatures wait for grace

treason in man to exercise his reason which might ingeniously devise one punishment for truth and lies and fairly prove when they had done that truth and falsehood were but one which juries must indeed retain but their effect should render vain making all real power to rest in one corrupted rotten breast by whose false gloss the very bible might be interpreted a libel m    who his reverence

our friends no man alive who would not swear all is safe and therefore honest there for spite of all the learned say if we to truth attention pay the word dishonesty is meant for nothing else but

subtle human wit find out a monster which might be the shadow of a simile these three these great these mighty three nor can the poets truth agree however report has done him wrong and warped the purpose of his song amongst the refuse of their race the sons of infamy to place that open generous manly mind which we with joy in aldrich find these three who now are faintly shown just sketchd and scarcely to be known if dullman their request had heard in stronger colors had appeared and friends though partial at first view shuddring had owned the picture true but had their journal been displayed and the whole process open laid what a vast unexhausted field for mirth must such a journal yield in her own anger strongly charmed against hope against fear by conscience armed then had bold satire made her way knights lords and dukes her destined prey but prudence ever sacred name to those who feel not virtues flame or only feel it at the best as the dull dupe of interest whispered aloud for this we find a custom current with mankind so loud to whisper that each word may all around be plainly heard and prudence sure would never miss a custom so contrived as this her candor to secure yet aim sure death against anothers fame knights lords and dukes  mad wretch forbear dangers unthought of ambush there confine thy rage to weaker slaves laugh at small fools and lash small knaves but never helpless mean and poor rush on where laws cannot secure nor think thyself mistaken youth secure in principles of truth truth why shall every wretch of letters dare to speak truth against his betters let ragged virtue stand aloof nor mutter accents of reproof let ragged wit a mute become when wealth and power would have her dumb for who the devil does not know that titles and estates bestow an ample stock wherere they fall of graces which we mental call beggars in every age and nation are rogues and fools by situation the rich and great are understood to be of course both wise and good consult then interest more than pride discreetly take the stronger side desert in time the simple few who virtues barren path pursue adopt my maxims  follow me  to baal bow the prudent knee deny thy god betray thy friend at baals altars hourly bend so shall thou rich and great be seen to be great now you must be mean hence tempter to some weaker soul which fear and interest control vainly thy precepts are addressed where virtue steels the steady breast through meanness wade to boasted power through guilt repeated every hour what is thy gain when all is done what mighty laurels have thou won dull crowds to whom the hearts unknown praise thee for virtues not thine own but will at once mans scourge and friend impartial conscience too commend from her reproaches can thou fly can thou with worlds her silence buy believe it not  her stings shall find a passage to thy coward mind there shall she fix her sharpest dart there show thee truly as thou art unknown to those by whom you are prized known to thyself to be despised the man who weds the sacred muse disdains all mercenary views and he who virtues throne would rear laughs at the phantoms raised by fear though folly robbed in purple shines though vice exhausts peruvian mines yet shall they tremble and turn pale when satire wields her mighty flail or should they of rebuke afraid with m     seek hells deepest shade satire still mindful of her aim shall bring the cowards back to shame hated by many loved by few above each little private view honest though poor and who shall dare to disappoint my boasting there hardy and resolute though weak the dictates of my heart to speak willing i bend at satires throne what power i have be all her own nor shall yon lawyers specious art conscious of a corrupted heart create imaginary fear to damp us in our bold career why should we fear and what the laws they all are armed in virtues cause and aiming at the selfsame end satire is always virtues friend nor shall that muse whose honest rage in a corrupt degenerate age when dead to every nicer sense deep sunk in vice and indolence the spirit of old rome was broke beneath the tyrant fidlers yoke banished the rose from neros cheek under a brunswick fear to speak drawn by conceit from reasons plan how vain is that poor creature man how pleased is every paultry elf to prate about that thing himself after my promise made in rhyme and meant in earnest at that time to jog according to the mode in one dull pace in one dull road what but that curse of heart and head to this digression could have led where plunged in vain i look about and cannot stay in nor well get out could i whilst humor held the quill could i digress with half that skill could i with half that skill return which we so much admire in stern where each digression seeming vain and only fit to entertain is found on better recollection to have a just and nice connection to help the whole with wondrous art whence it seems idly to depart then should our readers never accuse these wild excursions of the muse never backward turn dull pages over to recollect what went before deeply impressed and ever new each image past should start to view and we to dullman now come in as if we never had absent been have you not seen when dangers near the coward cheek turn white with fear have you not seen when dangers fled the selfsame cheek with joy turn red these are low symptoms which we find fit only for a vulgar mind where honest features void of art betray the feelings of the heart our dullman with a face was blessed where no one passion was expressed his eye in a fine stupor caught implied a plenteous lack of thought nor was one line that whole face seen in which could be justly charged with meaning to avarice by birth allied debauched by marriage into pride in age grown fond of youthful sports of pomps of vanities and courts and by success too mighty made to love his country or his trade stiff in opinion no rare case with blockheads in or out of place too weak and insolent of soul to suffer reasons just control but bending of his own accord to that trim transient toy my lord the dupe of scots a fatal race whom god in wrath contrived to place to scourge our crimes and gall our pride a constant thorn in englands side whom first our greatness to oppose he in his vengeance marked for foes then more to serve his wrathful ends and more to curse us marked for friends deep in the state if we give credit to him for no one else ere said it sworn friend of great ones not a few though he their titles only knew and those which envious of his breeding bookworms have charged to want of reading merely to show himself polite he never would pronounce aright an orator with whom a host of those which rome and athens boast in all their pride might not contend who with no powers to recommend whilst jacky hume and billy whitehead and dicky glover sat delighted could speak whole days in natures spite just as those
