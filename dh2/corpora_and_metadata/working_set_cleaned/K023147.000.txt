memoirs of the extraordinary life works and discoveries of martinus scriblerus  by mr pope  dublin printed by and for george faulkner mdccxli  introduction to the reader in the reign of queen anne which notwithstanding those happy times which succeeded every englishman may remember thou may possibly gentle reader have seen a certain venerable person who frequented the outside of the palace of st jamess and who by the gravity of his deportment and habit was generally taken for a decayed gentleman of spain his stature was tall his visage long his complexion olive his brows were black and even his eyes hollow yet piercing his nose inclined to aquiline his beard neglected and mixed with gray all this contributed to spread a solemn melancholy over his countenance pythagoras was not more silent pyrrho more motionless nor zeno more austere his wig was as black and smooth as the plumes of a raven and hung as strait as the hair of a rivergod rising from the water his cloak so completely covered his whole person that whether or no he had any other clothes much less any linen under it i shall not say but his sword appeared a full yard behind him and his manner of wearing it was so stiff that it seemed grown to his thigh his whole figure was so utterly unlike any thing of this world that it was not natural for any man to ask him a question without blessing himself first those who never saw a jesuit took him for one and others believed him some high priest of the jews  but under this macerated form was concealed a mind replete with science burning with a zeal of benefiting his fellowcreatures and filled with an honest conscious pride mixed with a scorn of doing or suffering the least thing beneath the dignity of a philosopher accordingly he had a soul that would not let him accept of any offers of charity at the same time that his body seemed but too much to require it his lodging was in a small chamber up four pair of stairs where he regularly paid for what he had when he eat or drank and he was often observed wholly to abstain from both he declined speaking to any one except the queen or her first minister to whom he attempted to make some applications but his real business or intentions were utterly unknown to all men thus much is certain that he was obnoxious to the queens ministry who either out of jealousy or envy had him spirited away and carried abroad as a dangerous person without any regard to the known laws of the kingdom  one day as this gentleman was walking about dinnertime alone in the mall it happened that a manuscript dropped from under his cloak which my servant picked up and brought to me it was written in the latin tongue and contained many most profound secrets in an unusual turn of reasoning and style the first leaf was inscribed with these words codicillus seu liber memorialis martini scribleri the book was of so wonderful a nature that it is incredible what a desire i conceived that moment to be acquainted with the author who i clearly perceived was some great philosopher in disguise i several times endeavored to speak to him which he as often industriously avoided at length i found an opportunity as he stood under the piazza by the dancingroom in st jamess to acquaint him in the latin tongue that his manuscript was fallen into my hands and saying this i presented it to him with great encomiums on the learned author hereupon he took me aside surveyed me over with a fixed attention and opening the clasps of the parchment cover spoke to my great surprise in english as follows   courteous stranger whoever thou art i embrace thee as my best friend for either the stars and my art are deceitful or the destined time is come which is to manifest martinus scriblerus to the world and thou the person chosen by fate for this task what thou see in me is a body exhausted by the labors of the mind i have found in dame nature not indeed an unkind but a very coy mistress watchful nights anxious days slender meals and endless labors must be the lot of all who pursue her through her labyrinths and meanders my first vital air i drew in this island a soil fruitful of philosophers but my complexion is become adust and my body arid by visiting lands as the poet has it alio sub sole calentes i have through my whole life passed under several disguises and unknown names to skreen my self from the envy and malice which mankind express against those who are possessed of the arcanum magnum but at present i am forced to take sanctuary in the british court to avoid the revenge of a cruel spaniard who has pursued me almost through the whole terraqueous globe being about four years ago in the city of madrid in quest of natural knowledge i was informed of a lady who was marked with a pomegranate upon the inside of her right thigh which blossomed and as it were seemed to ripen in the due season forthwith was i possessed with an insatiable curiosity to view this wonderful phenomenon i felt the ardour of my passion increase as the season advanced till in the month of july i could no longer contain i bribed her duenna was admitted to the bath saw her undressed and the wonder displayed this was soon after discovered by the husband who finding some letters i had writ to the duenna containing expressions of a doubtful meaning suspected me of a crime most alien from the purity of my thoughts incontinently i left madrid by the advice of friends have been pursued dogged and waylaid through several nations and even now scarce think my self secure within the sacred walls of this palace it has been my good fortune to have seen all the grand phenomenon of nature excepting an earthquake which i waited for in naples three years in vain and now by means of some british ship whose colors no spaniard dares approach i impatiently expect a safe passage to jamaica for that benefit to thee my friend whom fate has marked for my historiographer i leave these my commentaries and others of my works no more  be faithful and impartial  he soon after performed his promise and left me the commentaries giving me also further lights by many conferences when he was unfortunately snatched away as i before related by the jealousy of the queens ministry  though i was thus to my eternal grief deprived of his conversation he for some years continued his correspondence and communicated to me many of his projects for the benefit of mankind he sent me some of his writings and recommended to my care the recovery of others straggling about the world and assumed by other men the last time i heard from him was on occasion of his strictures on the dunciad since when several years being elapsed i have reason to believe this excellent person is either dead or carried by his vehement thirst of knowledge into some remote or perhaps undiscovered region of the world in either case i think it a debt no longer to be delayed to reveal what i know of this prodigy of science and to give the history of his life and of his extensive merits to mankind in which i dare promise the reader that whenever he begins to think any one chapter dull the style will be immediately changed in the next  memoirs of martinus scriblerus book i chap i of the parentage and family of scriblerus how he was begot what care was taken of him before he was born and what prodigies attended his birth in the city of munster in germany lived a grave and learned gentleman by profession an antiquary who among all his invaluable curiosities esteemed none more highly than a skin of the true pergamenian parchment which hung at the upperend of his hall on this was curiously traced the ancient pedigree of the scribleri with all their alliances and collateral relations among which were reckoned albertus magnus paracelsus bombastus and the famous scaligers in old time princes of verona and deduced even from the times of the elder pliny to cornelius scriblerus for such was the name of this venerable personage whose glory it was that by the singular virtue of the women not one had a head of a different cast from his family  his wife was a lady of singular beauty whom not for that reason only he espoused but because she was undoubted daughter either of the great scriverius or of gaspar barthius it happened on a time the said gaspar made a visit to scriverius at harlem taking with him a comely lady of his acquaintance who was skilful in the greek tongue of whom the learned scriverius became so enamored as to inebriate his friend and be familiar with his mistress i am not ignorant of what columesius relates this from isaac vossius in his opuscul p  0  columesius affirms that the learned barthius was not so overtaken but he perceived it and in revenge suffered this unfortunate gentlewoman to be drowned in the rhine at her return but mrs scriblerus the issue of that amor was a living proof of the falsehood of this report dr cornelius was further induced to his marriage from the certain information that the aforesaid lady the mother of his wife was related to cardan on the fathers side and to aldrovandus on the mothers besides which her ancestors had been professors of physic astrology or chemistry in german universities from generation to generation  with this fair gentlewoman had our doctor lived in a comfortable union for about ten years but this our sober and orderly pair without any natural infirmity and with a constant and frequent compliance to the chief duty of conjugal life were yet unhappy in that heaven had not blessed them with any issue this was the utmost grief to the good man especially considering what exact precautions and methods he had used to procure that blessing for he never had cohabitation with his spouse but he pondered on the rules of the ancients for the generation of children of wit he ordered his diet according to the prescription of galen confining himself and his wife for almost the whole first year to galen lib de cibis boni and mali succi cap   goats milk and honey it unfortunately befell her when she was about four months gone with child to long for somewhat which that author inveighs against as prejudicial to the understanding of the infant this her husband thought fit to deny her affirming it was better to be childless than to become the parent of a fool his wife miscarried but as the abortion proved only a female faetus he comforted himself that had it arrived to perfection it would not have answered his account his heart being wholly fixed upon the learned sex however he disdained not to treasure up the embryo in a vial among the curiosities of his family  having discovered that galens prescription could not determine the sex he forthwith betook himself to aristotle accordingly he withheld the nuptial embrace when the wind was in any point of the south this arist    sect prob   author asserting that the grossness and moisture of the southerly winds occasion the procreation of females and not of males but he redoubled his diligence when the wind was at west a wind on which that great philosopher bestowed the encomiums of fatner of the earth breath of the elysian fields and other glorious elogies for our learned man was clearly of opinion that the semina out of which animals are produced are animalcula ready formed and received in with the air religion of nature sect   parag      under these regulations his wife to his unexpressible joy grew pregnant a second time and what was no small addition to his happiness he just then came to the possession of a considerable estate by the death of her uncle a wealthy jew who resided at london this made it necessary for him to take a journey to england nor would the care of his posterity let him suffer his wife to remain behind him during the voyage he was perpetually taken up on the one hand how to employ his great riches and on the other how to educate his child he had already determined to set apart several annual sums for the recovery of manuscripts the effosson of coins the procuring of mummies and for all those curious discoveries by which he hoped to become as himself was wont to say a second peireskius he had already chalked out all possible schemes for the improvement of a male child yet was so far prepared for the worst that could happen that before the nine months were expired he had composed two treatises of education the one he called a daughters mirror and the other a sons monitor  this is all we can find relating to martinus while he was in his mothers womb excepting that he was entertained there with a consort of music once in twenty four hours according to the custom of the magi and that on a ramseys cyrus particular day he was observed to leap and kick exceedingly which was on the first of april the birthday of the great basilius valentinus  the truth of this and every preceding fact may be depended upon being taken literally from the memoirs but i must be so ingenuous as to own that the accounts are not so certain of the exact time and place of his birth as to the first he had the common frailty of old men to conceal his age as to the second i only remember to have heard him say that he first saw the light in st giless parish but in the investigation of this point fortune has favored our diligence for one day as i was passing by the seven dials i overheard a dispute concerning the place of nativity of a great astrologer which each man alleged to have been in his own street the circumstances of the time and the description of the person made me imagine it might be that universal genius whose life i am writing i returned home and having maturely considered their several arguments which i found to be of equal weight i quieted my curiosity with this natural conclusion that he was born in some point common to all the seven streets which must be that on which the column is now erected and it is with infinite pleasure that i since find my conjecture confirmed by the following passage in the codicil to mr neales will  i appoint my executors to engrave the following inscription on the column in the center of the seven streets which i erected loc not inclut philos mar scr but mr neales order was never performed because the executors durst not administer  nor was the birth of this great man unattended with prodigies he himself has often told me that on the night before he was born mrs scriblerus dreamed she was brought to bed of a huge inkhorn out of which issued several large streams of ink as it had been a fountain this dream was by her husband thought to signify that the child should prove a very voluminous writer likewise a virgils laurel donat crabtree that had been hitherto barren appeared on a sudden laden with a vast quantity of crabs this sign also the old gentleman imagined to be a prognostic of the acuteness of his wit a great swarm of plato lucan etc wasps played round his cradle without hurting him but were very troublesome to all in the room besides this seemed a certain presage of the effects of his satire a dunghill was seen within the space of one night to be covered all over with mushroom this some interpreted to promise the infant great fertility of fancy but no long duration to his works but the father was of another opinion  but what was of all most wonderful was a thing that seemed a monstrous fowl which just then dropped through the skylight near his wifes apartment it had a large body two little disproportioned wings a prodigious tail but no head as its color was white he took it at first sight for a swan and was concluding his son would be a poet but on a nearer view he preceived it to be speckled with black in the form of letters and that it was indeed a paper kite which had broke its leash by the impetuosity of the wind his back was armed with the art military his belly was filled with physic his wings were the wings of quarles and withers the several nodes of his voluminous tail were diversified with several branches of science where the doctor beheld with great joy a knot of logic a knot of metaphysick a knot of casuistry a knot of polemical divinity and a knot of common law with a lanthorn of jacob behmen  there went a report in the family that as soon as he was born he uttered the voice of nine several animals he cried like a calf bleated like a sheep chattered like a magpye grunted like a hog neighed like a foal croaked like a raven mewed like a cat gabbled like a goose and brayed like an ass and the next morning he was found playing in his bed with two owls which came down the chimney his father greatly rejoiced at all these signs which betokened the variety of his eloquence and the extent of his learning but he was more particularly pleased with the last as it nearly resembled what happened at the birth of vid eustat in odyss l    ex alex paphio and leo allat de patr hom page    homer  chap ii the speech of cornelius over his son at the hour of his birth no sooner was the cry of the infant heard but the old gentleman rushed into the room and snatching it in his arms examined every limb with attention he was infinitely pleased to find that the child had the wart of cicero the wry neck of alexander knots upon his legs like marius and one of them shorter than the other like agesilaus the good cornelius also hoped he would come to stammer like demosthenes in order to be as eloquent and in time arrive at many other defects of famous men he held the child so long that the midwife grown out of all patience snatched it from his arms in order to swaddle it  swaddle him quoth he far be it from me to submit to such a pernicious custom is not my son a man and is not man the lord of the universe is it thus you use this monarch at his first arrival in his dominions to manacle and shackle him hand and foot is this what you call to be freeborn if you have no regard to his natural liberty at least have some to his natural faculties behold with what agility he spreads his toes and moves them with as great variety as his fingers a power which in the small circle of a year may be totally abolished by the enormous confinement of shoes and stockings his ears which other animals turn with great advantage toward the sonorous object may by the ministry of some accursed nurse for ever lie flat and immovable not so the ancients they could move them at pleasure and accordingly are often described arrectis auribus  what a devil quoth the midwife would you have your son move his ears like a drill  yes fool said he why should he not have the perfection of a drill or of any other animal mrs scriblerus who lay all this while fretting at her husbands discourse at last broke out to this purpose  my dear i have had many disputes with you upon this subject before i was a month gone we have but one child and can not afford to throw him away upon experiments i will have my boy bred up like other gentlemen at home and always under my own eye all the gossips with one voice cried ay ay but cornelius broke out in this manner  what bred at home have i taken all this pains for a creature that is to lead the inglorious life of a cabbage to suck the nutritious juices from the spot where he was first planted no to perambulate this terraqueous globe is too small a range were it permitted he should at least make the tour of the whole system of the sun let other mortals pore upon maps and swallow the legends of lying travelers the son of cornelius shall make his own legs his compasses with those he shall measure continents islands capes bays streights and isthmuss he shall himself take the altitude of the highest mountains from the piek of derby to the piek of tenariff when he has visited the top of taurus imaus caucasus and the famous ararat where noahs ark first moored he may take a flight view of the snowy riphaeans nor would i have him neglect athos and olympus renowned for poetical fictions those that vomit fire will deserve a more particular attention i will therefore have him observe with great care vesuvius aetna the burning mountain of java but chiefly hecla the greatest rarity in the northern regions then he may likewise contemplate the wonders of the mephitick cave when he has dived into the bowels of the earth and surveyed the works of nature under ground and instructed himself fully in the nature of vulcanos earthquakes thunders tempests and hurricanes i hope he will bless the world with a more exact survey of the deserts of arabia and tartary than as yet we are able to obtain then will i have him cross the seven gulphs measure the currents in the fifteen famous streights and search for those fountains of fresh water that are at the bottom of the ocean  at these last words mrs scriblerus fell into a trembling the description of this terrible scene made too violent an impression upon a woman in her condition and threw her into a strong hysteric fit which might have proved dangerous if cornelius had not been pushed out of the room by the united force of the women  chap iii showing what befell the doctors son and his shield on the day of the christning the day of the christning being come and the house filled with gossips the levity of whose conversation suited but ill with the gravity of dr cornelius he cast about how to pass this day more agreeably to his character that is to say not without some profitable conference nor wholly without observance of some ancient custom  he remembered to have read in theocritus that the cradle of hercules was a shield and being possessed of an antique buckler which he held as a most inestimable relick he determined to have the infant laid therein and in that manner brought into the study to be shown to certain learned men of his acquaintance  the regard he had for this shield had caused him formerly to compile a dissertation concerning it proving from the several properties and particularly the color of the rust the exact chronology thereof  with this treatise and a moderate supper he proposed to entertain his guests though he had also another design to have their assistance in the calculation of his sons nativity  he therefore took the buckler out of a case in which he always kept it least it might contract any modern rust and entrusted it to his housemaid with orders that when the company was come she should lay the child carefully in it covered with a mantle of blue satin  the guests were no sooner seated but they entered into a warm debate about the triclinium and the manner of decubitus of the ancients which cornelius broke off in this manner  this day my friends i purpose to exhibit my son before you a child not wholly unworthy of inspection as he is descended from a race of virtuosi let the phisiognomists examine his features let the chirographists behold his palm but above all let us consult for the calculation of his nativity to this end as the child is not vulgar i will not present him unto you in a vulgar manner he shall be cradled in my ancient shield so famous through the universities of europe you all know how i purchased that invaluable piece of antiquity at the great though indeed inadequate expense of all the plate of our family how happily i carried it off and how triumphantly i transported it hither to the inexpressible grief of all germany happy in every circumstance but that it broke the heart of the great melchior insipidus  here he stopped his speech upon sight of the maid who entered the room with the child he took it in his arms and proceeded  behold then my child but first behold the shield behold this rust  or rather let me call it this precious aerugo  behold this beautiful varnish of time  this venerable verdure of so many ages   in speaking these words he slowly lifted up the mantle which covered it inch by inch but at every inch he uncovered his cheeks grew paler his hand trembled his nerves failed till on sight of the whole the tremor became universal the shield and the infant both dropped to the ground and he had only strength enough to cry out o god my shield my shield  the truth was the maid extremely concerned for the reputation of her own cleanliness and her young masters honor had scoured it as clean as her andirons  cornelius sunk back on a chair the guests stood astonished the infant squawld the maid ran in snatched it up again in her arms flew into her mistresses room and told what had happened down stairs in an instant hurried all the gossips where they found the doctor in a trance hungary water hartshorn and the confused noise of shrill voices at length awakened him when opening his eyes he saw the shield in the hands of the housemaid o woman woman he cried and snatched it violently from her was it to thy ignorance that this relick owes its ruin where where is the beautiful crust that covered thee so long where those traces of time and fingers as it were of antiquity where all those beautiful obscurities the cause of much delightful disputation where doubt and curiosity went hand in hand and eternally exercised the speculations of the learned all this the rude touch of an ignorant woman has done away the curious prominence at the belly of that figure which some taking for the cuspis of a sword denominated a roman soldier others accounting the insignia virilia pronounced to be one of the dii termini behold she has cleaned it in like shameful sort and shown to be the head of a nail o my shield my shield well may i say with horace non been relicta parmula  the gossips not at all inquiring into the cause of his sorrow only asked if the child had no hurt and cried come come all is well what has the woman done but her duty a tight cleanly wench i warrant her what a stir a man makes about a basin that an hour ago before this labor was bestowed upon it a country barber would not have hung at his shop door a basin cried another no such matter it is nothing but a paultry old sconce with the nozzle broke off the learned gentlemen who till now had stood speechless hereupon looking narrowly on the shield declared their assent to this latter opinion and desired cornelius to be comforted assuring him it was a sconce and no other but this instead of comforting threw the doctor into such a violent fit of passion that he was carried off groaning and speechless to bed where being quite spent he fell into a kind of slumber  chap iv of the suction and nutrition of the great scriblerus in his infancy and of the first rudiments of his learning as soon as cornelius awaked he raised himself on his elbow and casting his eye on mrs scriblerus spoke as follows wisely was it said by homer that in the cellar of jupiter are two barrels the one of good the other of evil which he never bestows on mortals separately but constantly mingles them together thus at the same time has heaven blessed me with the birth of a son and afflicted me with the scouring of my shield yet let us not repine at his dispensations who gives and who takes away but rather join in prayer that the rust of antiquity which he has been pleased to take from my shield may be added to my son and that so much of it as it is my purpose he shall contract in his education may never be destroyed by any modern polishing  he could no longer bear the sight of the shield but ordered it should be removed for ever from his eyes it was not long after purchased by dr woodward who by the assistance of mr kemp incrusted it with a new rust and is the same whereof a cut has been engraved and exhibited to the great contentation of the learned  cornelius now began to regulate the suction of his child seldom did there pass a day without disputes between him and the mother or the nurse concerning the nature of aliment the poor woman never dined but he denied her some dish or other which he judged prejudicial to her milk one day she had a longing desire to a piece of beef and as she stretched her hand toward it the old gentleman drew it away and spoke to this effect had thou read the ancients o nurse thou would prefer the welfare of the infant which thou nourishest to the indulging of an irregular and voracious appetite beef it is true may confer a robustness on the limbs of my son but will hebetate and clogg his intellectuals while he spoke this the nurse looked upon him with much anger and now and then cast a wishful eye upon the beef  passion continued the doctor still holding the dish throws the mind into too violent a fermentation it is a kind of fever of the soul or as horace expresses it a short madness consider woman that this days suction of my son may cause him to imbibe many ungovernable passions and in a manner spoil him for the temper of a philosopher romulus by sucking a wolf became of a fierce and savage disposition and were i to breed some ottoman emperor or founder of a military commonwealth perhaps i might indulge thee in this carnivorous appetite  what interrupted the nurse beef spoil the understanding that is fine indeed  how then could our parson preach as he does upon beef and pudding too if you go to that dont tell me of your ancients had not you almost killed the poor babe with a dish of daemonial black broth  lacedemonian black broth thou would say replied cornelius but i cannot allow the surfeit to have been occasioned by that diet since it was recommended by the divine lycurgus no nurse thou must certainly have eaten some meats of ill digestion the day before and that was the real cause of his disorder consider woman the different temperaments of different nations what makes the english phlegmatic and melancholy but beef what renders the welsh so hot and choleric but cheese and leeks the french derive their levity from their soups frogs and mushrooms i would not let my son dine like an italian lest like an italian he should be jealous and revengeful the warm and solid diet of spain may be more beneficial as it might indue him with a profound gravity but at the same time he might suck in with their food their intolerable vice of pride therefore nurse in short i hold it requisite to deny you at present not only beef but likewise whatsoever any of those nations eat during this speech the nurse remained pouting and marking her plate with the knife nor would she touch a bit during the whole dinner this the old gentleman observing ordered that the child to avoid the risque of imbibing ill humors should be kept from her breast all that day and be fed with butter mixed with honey according to a prescription he had met with somewhere in eustathius upon homer this indeed gave the child a great looseness but he was not concerned at it in the opinion that whatever harm it might do his body would be amply recompensed by the improvements of his understanding but from thenceforth he insisted every day upon a particular diet to be observed by the nurse under which having been long uneasy she at last parted from the family on his ordering her for dinner the paps of a sow with pig taking it as the highest indignity and a direct insult upon her sex and calling  four years of young martins life passed away in squabbles of this nature mrs scriblerus considered it was now time to instruct him in the fundamentals of religion and to that end took no small pains in teaching him his catechism but cornelius looked upon this as a tedious way of instruction and therefore employed his head to find out more pleasing methods the better to induce him to be fond of learning he would frequently carry him to the puppetshow of the creation of the world where the child with exceeding delight gained a notion of the history of the bible his first rudiments in profane history were acquired by seeing of rareeshows where he was brought acquainted with all the princes of europe in short the old gentleman so contrived it to make every thing contribute to the improvement of his knowledge even to his very dress he invented for him a geographical suit of clothes which might give him some hints of that science and likewise some knowledge of the commerce of different nations he had a french hat with an african feather holland shirts and flanders lace english cloth lined with indian silk his gloves were italian and his shoes were spanish he was made to observe this and daily catechisd thereupon which his father was wont to call traveling at home he never gave him a fig or an orange but he obliged him to give an account from what country it came in natural history he was much assisted by his curiosity in signposts insomuch that he has often confessed he owed to them the knowledge of many creatures which he never found since in any author such as white lions golden dragons etc he once thought the same of green men but had since found them mentioned by kercherus and verified in the history of william of newbury gul neubrig book i chapter      his disposition to the mathematics was discovered very early by his drawing pascals life lock of educ etc parallel lines on his bread and butter and intersecting them at equal angles so as to form the whole superficies into squares but in the midst of all these improvements a stop was put to his learning the alphabet nor would he let him proceed to letter d till he could truly and distinctly pronounce c in the ancient manner at which the child unhappily boggled for near three months he was also obliged to delay his learning to write having turned away the writing master because he knew nothing of fabiuss waxen tables  cornelius having read and seriously weighed the methods by which the famous montaigne was educated and resolving in some degree to exceed them resolved he should speak and learn nothing but the learned languages and especially the greek in which he constantly eat and drank according to homer but what most conduced to his easy attainment of this language was his love of gingerbread which his father observing caused it to be stamped with the letters of the greek alphabet and the child the very first day eat as far as iota by this particular application to this language above the rest he attained so great a proficience therein that gronovius ingenuously confesses he durst not confer with this child in greek at eight years old and at fourteen he composed a tragedy in the same language as the younger plin epist lib   pliny had done before him  he learned the oriental languages of erpenius who resided some time with his father for that purpose he had so early a relish for the eastern way of writing that even at this time he composed in imitation of it the thousand and one arabian tales and also the persian tales which have been since translated into several languages and lately into our own with particular elegance by mr ambrose philips in this work of his childhood he was not a little assisted by the historical traditions of his nurse  chap v a dissertation upon playthings here follow the instructions of cornelius scriblerus concerning the plays and playthings to be used by his son martin   play was invented by the lydians as a remedy against hunger sophocles says of palamedes that he invented dice to serve sometimes instead of a dinner it is therefore wisely contrived by nature that children as they have the keenest appetites are most addicted to plays from the same cause and from the unprejudiced and incorrupt simplicity of their minds it proceeds that the plays of the ancient children are preserved more entire than any other of their customs in this matter i would recommend to all who have any concern in my sons education that they deviate not in the least from the primitive and simple antiquity   to speak first of the whistle as it is the first of all playthings i will have it exactly to correspond with the ancient fistula and accordingly to be composed septem paribus disjuncta cicutis   i heartily wish a diligent search may be made after the true crepitaculum or rattle of the ancients for that as archytas tarentinus was of opinion kept the children from breaking earthen ware the china cups in these days are not at all the safer for the modern rattles which is an evident proof how far their crepitacula exceeded ours   i would not have martin as yet to scourge a top till i am better informed whether the trochus which was recommended by cato be really our present top or rather the hoop which the boys drive with a stick neither cross and pile nor ducks and drakes are quite so ancient as handydandy though marcobius and st augustine take notice of the first and minutius foelix describes the latter but handydandy is mentioned by aristotle plato and aristophanes   the play which the italians call cinque and the french mourre is extremely ancient it was played at by hymen and cupid at the marriage of psyche and termed by the latins digitis micare   julius pollux describes the omilla or chuck farthing though some will have our modern chuckfarthing to be nearer the aphetinda of the ancients he also mentions the basilinda or king i am and myinda or hoopershide   but the chytindra described by the same author is certainly not our hotcockle for that was by pinching and not by striking though there are good authors who affirm the rathapygismus to be yet nearer the modern hotcockle my son martin may use either of them indifferently they being equally antique   building of houses and riding upon sticks have been used by children in all ages aedificare casas equitare in arundine longa yet i must doubt whether the riding upon sticks did not come into use after the age of the centaurs   there is one play which shows the gravity of ancient education called the acinetinda in which children contended who could longest stand still this we have suffered to perish entirely and if i might be allowed to guess it was certainly first lost among the french   i will permit my son to play at apodidiascinda which can be no other than our puss in a corner   julius pollux in his ninth book speaks of the melolouthe or the kite but i question whether the kite of antiquity was the same with ours and though the  or quailfighting is what is most taken notice of they had doubtless cockmatches also as is evident from certain ancient gems and relievos   in a word let my son martin disport himself at any game truly antique except one which was invented by a people among the thracians who hung up one of their companions in a rope and gave him a knife to cut himself down which if he failed in he was suffered to hang till he was dead and this was only reckoned a sort of joke i am utterly against this as barbarous and cruel   i cannot conclude without taking notice of the beauty of the greek names whose etymologies acquaint us with the nature of the sports and how infinitely both in sense and sound they excel our barbarous names of plays  notwithstanding the foregoing injunctions of dr cornelius he yet condescended to allow the child the use of some few modern playthings such as might prove of any benefit to his mind by instilling an early notion of the sciences for example he found that marbles taught him percussion and the laws of motion nutcrackers the use of the leaver swinging on the ends of a board the balance bottlescrews the vice whirligigs the axis and peritrochia birdcages the pully and tops the centrifugal motion  others of his sports were farther carried to improve his tender soul even in virtue and morality we shall only instance one of the most useful and instructive bobcherry which teaches at once two noble virtues patience and constancy the first in adhering to the pursuit of one end the latter in bearing a disappointment  besides all these he taught him as a diversion an odd and secret manner of stealing according to the custom of the lacedaemonians wherein he succeeded so well that he practiced it to the day of his death  chap vi of the gymnasticks in what exercises martinus was educated something concerning music and what sort of a man his uncle was nor was cornelius less careful in adhering to the rules of the purest antiquity in relation to the exercises of his son he was stripped powdered and anointed but not constantly bathed which occasioned many heavy complaints of the laundress about dirtying his linen when he played at quoits he was allowed his breeches and stockings because the discoboli as cornelius well knew were naked  the middle only the mother often contended for modern sports and common customs but this was his constant reply let a daughter be the care of her mother but the education of a son should be the delight of his father  it was about this time he heard to his exceeding content that the harpastus of the ancients was yet in use in cornwall and known there by the name of hurling he was sensible the common football was a very imperfect imitation of that exercise and thought it necessary to send martin into the west to be initiated in that truly ancient and manly part of the gymnasticks the poor boy was so unfortunate as to return with a broken leg this cornelius looked upon but as a slight ailment and promised his mother he would instantly cure it he slit a green reed and cast the knife upward then tying the two parts of the reed to the disjointed place pronounced these words pliny hist not lib    in fine carmen contra luxata membra eujus verba inserere non equidem serio ausim quanquam a catone prodita vid cato de re rust c   0 daries daries astataries dissunapiter huat hanat huat ista pista fista domi abo damnaustra but finding to his no small astonishment that this had no effect in five days he condescended to have it set by a modern surgeon  mrs scriblerus to prevent him from exposing her son to the like dangerous exercises for the future proposed to send for a dancing master and to have him taught the minuet and rigadoon dancing quoth cornelius i much approve for socrates said the best dancers were the best warriors but not those species of dancing which you mention they are certainly corruptions of the comic and satyric dance which were utterly disliked by the sounder ancients martin shall learn the tragic dance only and i will send all over europe till i find an antiquary able to instruct him in the saltatio pyrrhica scalig poetic l   c   hanc saltationem pyrrhicam nos saepe and diu jussu bonifacii patrui coram divo maximiliano non sine stupore totius germaniae repraesentavimus quo tempore vox illa imperatoris hic puer out thoracem pro pelle out pro cunis habuit scaliger from whom my son is lineally descended boasts to have performed this warlike dance in the presence of the emperor to the great admiration of all germany what would he say could be look down and see one of his posterity so ignorant as not to know the least step of that noble kind of saltation  the poor lady was at last enured to bear all these things with a laudable patience till one day her husband was seized with a new thought he had met with a saying that  spleen garter and girdle are the three impediments to the cursus therefore pliny lib xi cap    says that such as excel in that exercise have their spleen cauterizd my son quoth cornelius runs but heavily therefore i will have this operation performed upon him immediately moreover it will cure that immoderate laughter to which i perceive he is addicted for laughter as the same author has it ibid is caused by the bigness of the spleen this design was no sooner hinted to mrs scriblerus but she burst into tears wrung her hands and instantly sent to his brother albertus begging him for the love of god to make haste to her husband  albertus was a discreet man sober in his opinions clear of pedantry and knowing enough both in books and in the world to preserve a due regard for whatever was useful or excellent whether ancient or modern if he had not always the authority he had at least the art to divert cornelius from many extravagancies it was well he came speedily or martin could not have boasted the entire quota of his viscera what does it signify quoth albertus whether my nephew excels in the cursus or not speed is often a symptom of cowardice witness hares and deer  do not forget achilles quoth cornelius i know that running has been condemned by the proud spartans as useless in war and yet demosthenes could say  a thought which the english hudibras has well rendered for he that runs may fight again which he can never do that is slain that is true quoth albertus but pray consider on the other side that animals blackmores essay on spleen spleened grow extremely salacious an experiment well known in dogs cornelius was struck with this and replied gravely if it be so i will defer the operation for i will not increase the powers of my sons body at the expense of those of his mind i am indeed disappointed in most of my projects and fear i must down at last contented with such methods of education as modern barbarity affords happy had it been for us all had we lived in the age of augustus then my son might have heard the philosophers dispute in the porticos of the palestra and at the same time formed his body and his understanding it is true replied albertus we have no exedra for the philosophers adjoining to our tenniscourts but there are alehouses where he will hear very notable argumentations though we come not up to the ancients in the tragicdance we excel them in the  or the art of tumbling the ancients would have beat us at quoits but not so much at the jaculum or pitching the bar the fistycuffs pugilatus is in as great perfection in england as in old rome and the cornishhug in the wrestling luctus is equal to the volutatoria of the ancients you could not answered cornelius have produced a more unlucky instance of modern folly and barbarity than what you say of the jaculum the arist politic lib   cap   cretians wisely forbid their servants gymnasticks as well as arms and yet your modern footmen exercise themselves daily in the jaculum at the corner of hydepark whist their enervated lords are lolling in their chariots a species of vectitation seldom used amongst the ancients except by old men you say well quoth albertus and we have several other kinds of vectitation unknown to the ancients particularly flying chariots where the people may have the benefit of this exercise at the small expense of a farthing but suppose which i readily grant that the ancients excelled us almost in every thing yet why this singularity your son must take up with such masters as the present age affords we have dancingmasters writingmasters and musickmasters  the bare mention of music threw cornelius into a passion how can you dignify quoth he this modern fidling with the name of music will any of your best hautboys encounter a wolf now adays with no other arms but their instruments as did that ancient piper pythocaris have ever wild boars elephants deer dolphins whales or turbotts showed the least emotion at the most elaborate strains of your modern scrapers all which have been as it were tamed and humanizd by ancient musicians does not aelian hist animal lib xi cap    and lib xii cap    aelian tell us how the lybian mares were excited to horsing by music which ought in truth to be a caution to modest women against frequenting operas and consider brother you are brought to this dilemma either to give up the virtue of the ladies or the power of your music whence proceeds the degeneracy of our morals is it not from the loss of ancient music by which says aristotle they taught all the virtues else might we turn newgate into a college of dorian musicians who should teach moral virtues to those people whence comes it that our present diseases are so stubborn whence is it that i daily deplore my sciatical pains alas because we have lost their true cure by the melody of the pipe all this was well known to the ancients as athenaeus lib xiv theophrastus assures us whence lib de sanitat tuend cap   caelius calls it loca dolentia decantare only indeed some small remains of this skill is preserved in the cure of the tarantula did not quintilian lib   cap  0 pythagoras stop a company of drunken bullies from storming a civil house by changing the strain of the pipe to the sober spondaeus and yet your modern musicians want art to defend their windows from common nickers it is well known that when the lacedaemonian mob were up they suidas in timotheo commonly sent for a lesbian musician to appease them and they immediately grew calm as soon as they heard terpander sing yet i dont believe that the popes whole band of music though the best of this age could keep his holinesss image from being burnt on a fifth of november nor would terpander himself replied albertus at billing sgate nor timotheus at hockley in the hole have any manner of effect nor both of em together bring horneck a scurrilous scribler who wrote a weekly paper called the high german doctor horneck to common civility that is a gross mistake said cornelius very warmly and to prove it so i have here a small lyra of my own framed strung and tuned after the ancient manner i can play some fragments of lesbian tunes and i wish i were to try them upon the most passionate creatures alive  you never had a better opportunity says albertus for yonder are two applewomen scolding and just ready to uncoif one another with that cornelius undressed as he was jumps out into his balcony his lyra in hand in his slippers with his breeches hanging down to his ankles a stocking upon his head and a waistcoat of murreycolourd satin upon his body he touched his lyra with a very unusual sort of an harpegiatura nor were his hopes frustrated the odd equipage the uncouth instrument the strangeness of the man and of the music drew the ears and eyes of the whole mob that were got about the two female champions and at last of the combatants themselves they approached the balcony in as close attention as orpheuss first audience of cattle or that of an italian opera when some favorite air is just awakened this sudden effect of his music encouraged him mightily and it was observed he never touched his lyre in such a truly chromatick and enharmonick manner as upon that occasion the mob laughed sung jumped danced and used many odd gestures all which he judged to be caused by his various strains and modulations mark quoth he in this the power of the ionian in that you see the effect of the aeolian but in a little time they began to grow riotous and threw stones cornelius then withdrew but with the greatest air of triumph in the world brother said he do you observe i have mixed unawares too much of the phrygian i might change it to the lydian and soften their riotous tempers but it is enough learn from this sample to speak with veneration of ancient music if this lyre in my unskilful hands can perform such wonders what must it not have done in those of a timotheus or a terpander having said this he retired with the utmost exultation in himself and contempt of his brother and it is said behaved that night with such unusual haughtiness to his family that they all had reason to wish for some ancient tibicen to calm his temper  chap vii rhetoric logic and metaphysics cornelius having as has been said many ways been disappointed in his attempts of improving the bodily forces of his son thought it now high time to apply to the culture of his internal faculties he judged it proper in the first place to instruct him in rhetoric but herein we shall not need to give the reader any account of his wonderful progress since it is already known to the learned world by his treatise on this subject i mean the admirable discourse  which he wrote at this time but concealed from his father knowing his extreme partiality for the ancients it lay by him concealed and perhaps forgot among the great multiplicity of other writings till about the year      he sent it us to be printed with many additional examples drawn from the excellent live poets of this present age we proceed therefore to logic and metaphysick  the wise cornelius was convinced that these being polemical arts could no more be learned alone than fencing or cudgelplaying he thought it therefore necessary to look out for some youth of pregnant parts to be a sort of humble companion to his son in those studies his good fortune directed him to one of most singular endowments whose name was conradus crambe who by the fathers side was related to the crouches of cambridge and his mother was cousin to mr swan gamester and punster of the city of london so that from both parents he drew a natural disposition to sport himself with words which as they are said to be the counters of wise men and readymoney of fools crambe had great store of cash of the latter sort happy martin in such a parent and such a companion what might not he atchieve in arts and sciences  here i must premise a general observation of great benefit to mankind that there are many people who have the use only of one operation of the intellect though like shortsighted men they can hardly discover it themselves they can form single apprehensions but have neither of the other two faculties the judicium or discursus now as it is wisely ordered that people deprived of one sense have the others in more perfection such people will form single ideas with a great deal of vivacity and happy were it indeed if they would confine themselves to such without forming judicia much less argumentations  cornelius quickly discovered that these two last operations of the intellect were very weak in martin and almost totally extinguished in crambe however he used to say that rules of logic are spectacles to a purblind understanding and therefore he resolved to proceed with his two pupils  martins understanding was so totally immersed in sensible objects that he demanded examples from material things of the abstracted ideas of logic as for crambe he contented himself with the words and when he could but form some conceit upon them was fully satisfied thus crambe would tell his instructor that all men were not singular that individuality could hardly be praedicated of any man for it was commonly said that a man is not the same he was that madmen are beside themselves and drunken men come to themselves which shows that few men have that most valuable logical endowment individuality cornelius told martin that a shoulder of mutton was an individual which crambe denied for he had seen it cut into commons that is true quoth the tutor but you never saw it cut into shoulders of mutton if it could quoth crambe it would be the most lovely individual of the university when he was told a substance was that which was subject to accidents then soldiers quoth crambe are the most substantial people in the world neither would he allow it to be a good definition of accident that it could be present or absent without the destruction of the subject since there are a great many accidents that destroy the subject as burning does a house and death a man but as to that cornelius informed him that there was a natural death and a logical death that though a man after his natural death was not capable of the least parishoffice yet he might still keep his stall amongst the logical praedicaments  cornelius was forced to give martin sensible images thus calling up the coachman he asked him what he had seen at the beargarden the man answered he saw two men fight a prize one was a fair man a sergeant in the guards the other black a butcher the sergeant had red breeches the butcher blue they fought upon a stage about four oclock and the sergeant wounded the butcher in the leg mark quoth cornelius how the fellow runs through the praedicaments men substantia two quantitas fair and black qualitas sergeant and butcher relatio wounded the other actio and passio fighting situs stage ubi two a clock quando blue and red breeches habitus at the same time he warned martin that what he now learned as a logician he must forget as a natural philosopher that though he now taught them that accidents inherd in the subject they would find in time there was no such thing and that color taste smell heat and cold were not in the things but only phantasms of our brains he was forced to let them into this secret for martin could not conceive how a habit of dancing inherd in a dancingmaster when he did not dance nay he would demand the characteristicks of relations crambe used to help him out by telling him a cuckold a losing gamester a man that had not dined a young heir that was kept short by his father might be all known by their countenance that in this last case the paternity and filiation leave very sensible impressions in the relatum and correlatum the greatest difficulty was when they came to the tenth praedicament crambe affirmed that his habitus was more a substance than he was for his clothes could better subsist without him than he without his clothes  martin supposed an universal man to be like a knight of a shire or a burgess of a corporation that represented a great many individuals his father asked him if he could not frame the idea of an universal lord mayor martin told him that never having seen but one lord mayor the idea of that lord mayor always returned to his mind that he had great difficulty to abstract a lord mayor from his fur gown and gold chain nay that the horse he saw the lord mayor ride upon not a little disturbed his imagination on the other hand crambe to show himself of a more penetrating genius swore that he could frame a conception of a lord mayor not only without his horse gown and gold chain but even without stature feature color hands head feet or any body which he supposed was the abstract of a lord mayor cornelius told him that he was a lying rascal that an universale was not the object of imagination and that there was no such thing in reality or a part rei but i can prove quoth crambe that there are clysters a part rei but clysters are universales ergo thus i prove my minor quod aptum est inesse multis is an universale by definition but every clyster before it is administered has that quality therefore every clyster is an universale  he also found fault with the advertisements that they were not strict logical definitions in an advertisement of a dog stolen or strayed he said it ought to begin thus an irrational animal of the genus caninum etc cornelius told them that though those advertisements were not framed according to the exact rules of logical definitions being only descriptions of things numero differentibus yet they contained a faint image of the praedicabilia and were highly subservient to the common purposes of life often discovering things that were lost both animate and inanimate an italian greybound of a mousecolour a white speck in the neck lame of one leg belongs to such a lady greyhound genus mousecolourd etc differentia lame of one leg accidents belongs to such a lady proprium  though i am afraid i have transgressed upon my readers patience already i cannot help taking notice of one thing more extraordinary than any yet mentioned which was crambes treatise of syllogisms he supposed that a philosophers brain was like a great forest where ideas ranged like animals of several kinds that those ideas copulated and engendered conclusions that when those of different species copulate they bring forth monsters or absurdities that the major is the male the minor the female which copulate by the middle term and engender the conclusion hence they are called the praemissa or predecessors of the conclusion and it is properly said by logicians quod pariunt scientiam opinionem they beget science opinion etc universal propositions are persons of quality and therefore in logic they are said to be of the first figure singular propositions are private persons and therefore placed in the third or last figure or rank from those principles all the rules of syllogisms naturally follow i that there are only three terms neither more nor less for to a child there can be only one father and one mother ii from universal premises there follows an universal conclusion as if one should say that persons of quality always beget persons of quality iii from singular premises follows only a singular conclusion that is if the parents be only private people the issue must be so likewise iv from particular propositions nothing can be concluded because the individua vaga are like whoremasters and common strumpets barren v there cannot be more in the conclusion than was in the premises that is children can only inherit from their parents vi the conclusion follows the weaker part that is children inherit the diseases of their parents vii from two negatives nothing can be concluded for from divorce or separation there can come no issue viii the medium cannot enter the conclusion that being logical incest ix an hypothetical proposition is only a contract or a promise of marriage from such therefore there can spring no real issue x when the premises or parents are necessarily joined or in lawful wedlock they beget lawful issue but contingently joined they beget bastards   so much for the affirmative propositions the negative must be deferred to another occasion  crambe used to value himself upon this system from whence he said one might see the propriety of the expression such a one has a barren imagination and how common it is for such people to adopt conclusions that are not the issue of their premises therefore as an absurdity is a monster a falsity is a bastard and a true conclusion that follows not from the premises may properly be said to be adopted but then what is an enthymem quoth cornelius why an enthymem replied crambe is when the major is indeed married to the minor but the marriage kept secret  metaphysics were a large field in which to exercise the weapons logic had put into their hands here martin and crambe used to engage like any prize fighters before their father and his other learned companions of the symposiacks and as prize fighters will agree to lay aside a buckler or some such defensive weapon so would crambe promise not to use simpliciter and secundum quid provided martin would part with materialiter and formaliter but it was found that without the help of the defensive armor of those distinctions the arguments cut so deep that they fetched blood at every stroke their theses was picked out of suarez thomas aquinas and other learned writers on those subjects i shall give the reader a taste of some of them i if the innate desire of the knowledge of metaphysics was the cause of the fall of adam and the arbor porphyriana the tree of knowledge of good and evil affirmed ii if transcendental goodness could be truly praedicated of the devil affirmed iii whether one or many be first or if one does not suppose the notion of many suarez iv if the desire of news in mankind be appetitus innatus not elicitus affirmed v whether there is in human understandings potential falsities affirmed vi whether god loves a possible angel better than an actuallyexistent fly denied vii if angels pass from one extreme to another without going through the middle aquinas viii if angels know things more clearly in a morning aquinas ix whether every angel hears what one angel says to another denied aquinas x if temptation be proprium quarto modo of the devil denied aquinas xi whether one devil can illuminate another aquin xii if there would have been any females born in the state of innocence aquinas xiii if the creation was finished in six days because six is the most perfect number or if six be the most perfect number because the creation was finished in six days aquinas there were several others of which in the course of the life of this learned person we may have occasion to treat and one particularly that remains undecided to this day it was taken from the learned suarez xiv an praeter esse reale actualis essentiae sit aliud esse necessarium quo res actualiter existat in english thus whether besides the real being of actual being there be any other being necessary to cause a thing to be   this brings into my mind a project to banish metaphysics out of spain which was supposed might be effectuated by this method that nobody should use any compound or decompound of the substantial verbs but as they are read in the common conjugations for every body will allow that if you debar a metaphysician from ens essentia entitas subsistentia etc there is an end of him  crambe regretted extremely that substantial forms a race of harmless beings which had lasted for many years and afforded a comfortable subsistence to many poor philosophers should be now hunted down like so many wolves without the possibility of a retreat he considered that it had gone much harder with them than with essences which had retired from the schools into the apothecaries shops where some of them had been advanced into the degree of quintessences he thought there should be a retreat for poor substantial forms amongst the gentleushers at court and that there were indeed substantial forms such as forms of prayer and forms of government without which the things themselves could neyer long subsist he also used to wonder that there was not a reward for such as could find out a fourth figure in logic as well as for those who should discover the longitude  chap viii anatomy cornelius it is certain had a most superstitious veneration for the ancients and if they contradicted each other his reason was so pliant and ductile that he was always of the opinion of the last he read but he reckoned it a point of honor never to be vanquished in a dispute from which quality he acquired the title of the invincible doctor while the professor of anatomy was demonstrating to his son the several kinds of intestines cornelius affirmed that there were only two the colon and the aichos according to hippocrates who it was impossible could ever be mistaken it was in vain to assure him this error proceeded from want of accuracy in dividing the whole canal of the guts say what you please he replied this is both mine and hippocratess opinion you may with equal reason answered the professor affirm that a mans liver has five lobes and deny the circulation of the blood ocular demonstration said cornelius seems to be on your side yet i shall not give it up show me any viscus of a human body and i will bring you a monster that differs from the common rule in the structure of it if nature shows such variety in the same age why may she not have extended it further in several ages produce me a man now of the age of an antidiluvian of the strength of sampson or the size of the giants if in the whole why not in parts of the body may it not be possible the present generation of men may differ from the ancients the moderns have perhaps lengthened the channel of the guts by gluttony and diminished the liver by hard drinking though it shall be demonstrated that modern blood circulates yet i will still believe with hippocrates that the blood of the ancients had a flux and reflux from the heart like a tide consider how luxury has introduced new diseases and with them not improbably altered the whole course of the fluids consider how the current of mighty rivers nay the very channels of the ocean are changed from what they were in ancient days and can we be so vain to imagine that the microcosm of the human body alone is exempted from the fate of all things i question not but plausible conjectures may be made even as to the time when the blood first began to circulate  such disputes as these frequently perplexed the professor to that degree that he would now and then in a passion leave him in the middle of a lecture as he did at this time  there unfortunately happened soon after an unusual accident which retarded the prosecution of the studies of martin having purchased the body of a malefactor he hired a room for its dissection near the pestfields in st giless at a little distance from tyburn road crambe to whose care this body was committed carried it thither about twelve a clock at night in a hackneycoach few housekeepers being very willing to let their lodgings to such kind of operators as he was softly stalking up stairs in the dark with the dead man in his arms his burden had like to have slipped from him which he to save from falling grasped so hard about the belly that it forced the wind through the anus with a noise exactly like the crepitus of a living man crambe who did not comprehend how this part of the animal economy could remain in a dead man was so terrified that he threw down the body ran up to his master and had scarce breath to tell him what had happened martin with all his philosophy could not prevail upon him to return to his post you may say what you please quoth crambe no man alive ever broke wind more naturally nay he seemed to be mightily relieved by it the rolling of the corpse down stairs made such a noise that it awaked the whole house the maid shrieked the landlady cried out thieves but the landlord in his shirt as he was taking a candle in one hand and a drawn sword in the other ventured out of the room the maid with only a single petticoat ran up stairs but spurning at the dead body fell upon it in a swoon now the landlord stood still and listned then he looked behind him and ventured down in this manner one stair after another till he came where lay his maid as dead upon another corpse unknown the wife ran into the street and cried out murder the watch ran in while martin and crambe hearing all this uproar were coming down stairs the watch imagined they were making their escape seized them immediately and carried them to a neighboring justice where upon searching them several kind of knives and dreadful weapons were found upon them the justice first examined crambe what is your name says the justice i have acquired quoth crambe no great name as yet they call me crambe or crambo no matter which as to my self though it may be some dispute to posterity  what is yours and your masters profession  it is our business to imbrue our hands in blood we cut off the heads and pull out the hearts of those that never injured us we rip up bigbellyd women and tear children limb from limb martin endeavored to interrupt him but the justice being strangely astonished with the frankness of crambes confession ordered him to proceed upon which he made the following speech  may it please your worship as touching the body of this man i can answer each head that my accusers allege against me to a hair they have hitherto talked like numsculls without brains but if your worship will not only give ear but regard me with a favorable eye i will not be browbeaten by the supercilious looks of my adversaries who now stand cheek by jowl by your worship i will prove to their faces that their foul mouths have not opened their lips without a falsity though they have showed their teeth as if they would bite off my nose now sir that i may fairly slip my neck out of the collar i beg this matter may not be slightly skinned over though i have no man here to back me i will unbosom my self since truth is on my side and shall give them their bellies full though they think they have me upon the hip whereas they say i came into their lodgings with arms and murdered this man without their privity i declare i had not the least finger in it and since i am to stand upon my own legs nothing of this matter shall be left till i set it upon a right foot in the vein i am in i cannot for my hearts blood and guts bear this usage i shall not spare my lungs to defend my good name i was ever reckoned a good liver and i think i have the bowels of compassion i ask but justice and from the crown of my head to the soal of my foot i shall ever acknowledge my self your worships humble servant  the justice stared the landlord and landlady lifted up their eyes and martin fretted while crambe talked in this rambling incoherent manner till at length martin begged to be heard it was with great difficulty that the justice was convinced till they sent for the finisher of human laws of whom the corpse had been purchased who looking near the left ear knew his own work and gave oath accordingly  no sooner was martin got home but he fell into a passion at crambe what demon he cried has possessed thee that thou will never forsake that impertinent custom of punning neither my council nor my example have thus misled thee thou governest thy self by most erroneous maxims far from it answers crambe my life is as orderly as my dictionary for by my dictionary i order my life i have made a calendar of radical words for all the seasons months and days of the year every day i am under the dominion of a certain word but this day in particular i cannot be misled for i am governed by one that rules all sexes ages conditions nay all animals rational and irrational who is not governed by the word led our noblemen and drunkards are pimpled physicians and pulses feeled their patients and oranges pilled a newmarried man and an ass are brideled an oldmarried man and a packhorse sadled cats and dice are ratled swine and nobility are styled a coquet and a tinderbox are sparkled a lover and a blunderer are groveled and that i may not be tedious  which thou art replied martin stamping with his foot which thou art i say beyond all human toleration  such an unnatural unaccountable uncoherent unintelligible unprofitable  there it is now interrupted crambe this is your day for uns martin could bear no longer  however composing his countenance come hither  he cried there are five pounds seventeen shillings and nine pence thou have been with me eight months three weeks two days and four hours poor crambe upon the receipt of his salary fell into tears flung the money upon the ground and burst forth in these words o cicero cicero if to pun be a crime it is a crime i have learned from thee o bias bias if to pun be a crime by thy example was i biasd whereupon martin considering that one of the greatest of orators and even a sage of greece had punned hesitted relented and reinstated crambe in his service  chap ix how martin become a great critic it was a most peculiar talent in martinus to convert every trifle into a serious thing either in the way of life or in learning this can no way be better exemplified than in the effect which the puns of crambe had on the mind and studies of martinus he conceived that somewhat of a like talent to this of crambe of assembling parallel sounds either syllables or words might conduce to the emendation and correction of ancient authors if applied to their works with the same diligence and the same liberty he resolved to try first upon virgil horace and terence concluding that if the most correct authors could be so served with any reputation to the critic the amendment and alteration of all the rest would easily follow whereby a new a vast nay boundless field of glory would be opened to the true and absolute critic  this specimen on virgil he has given us in the addenda to his notes on the dunciad his terence and horace are in every bodies hands under the names of richard bley and francis hre and we have convincing proofs that the late edition of milton published in the name of the former of these was in truth the work of no other than our scriblerus  chap x of martinuss uncommon practice of physic and how he applied himself to the diseases of the mind but it is high time to return to the history of the progress of martinus in the studies of physic and to enumerate some at least of the many discoveries and experiments he made therein  one of the first was his method of investigating latent distempers by the sagacious quality of settingdogs and pointers the success and the adventures that besel him when he walked with these animals to smell them out in the parks and public places about london are what we would willingly relate but that his own account together with a list of those gentlemen and ladies at whom they made a full set will be published in time convenient there will also be added the representation which on occasion of one distemper which was become almost epidemical he thought himself obliged to lay before both houses of parliament entitled a proposal for a general flux to exterminate at one blow the px out of this kingdom  he next proceeded to an enquiry into the nature and tokens of virginity according to the jewish doctrines which occasioned that most curious treatise of the purification of vid esther chap   verse    queen esther with a display of her case at large speedily also to be published  but being weary of all practice on foetid bodies from a certain niceness of constitution especially when he attended dr woodward through a twelvemonths course of vomition he determined to leave it off entirely and to apply himself only to diseases of the mind he attempted to find out specificks for all the passions and as other physicians throw their patients into sweats vomits purgations etc he cast them into love hatred hope fear joy grief etc and indeed the great irregularity of the passions in the english nation was the chief motive that induced him to apply his whole studies while he continued among us to the diseases of the mind  to this purpose he directed in the first place his late acquired skill in anatomy he considered virtues and vices as certain habits which proceed from the natural formation and structure of particular parts of the body a bird flies because it has wings a duck swims because it is webfooted and there can be no question but the aduncity of the pounces and beaks of the hawks as well as the length of the fangs the sharpness of the teeth and the strength of the crural and massetermuscles in lions and tigers are the cause of the great and habitual immorality of those animals  is it he observed that the soul and body mutually operate upon each other and therefore if you deprive the mind of the outward instruments whereby she usually expresses that passion you will in time abate the passion itself in like manner as castration abates lust   dly that the soul in mankind expresses every passion by the motion of some particular muscles   dly that all muscles grow stronger and thicker by being much used therefore the habitual passions may be discerned in particular persons by the strength and bigness of the muscles used in the expression of that passion   thly that a muscle may be strengthened or weaknd by weakening or strengthening the force of its antagonist these things premised he took notice  that complaisance humility assent approbation and civility were expressed by nodding the head and bowing the body forward on the contrary dissent dislike refusal pride and arrogance were marked by tossing the head and bending the body backwards which two passions of assent and dissent the latins rightly expressed by the words adnuere and abnuere now he observed that complaisant and civil people had the flexors of the head very strong but in the proud and insolent there was a great overbalance of strength in the extensors of the neck and the muscles of the back from whence they perform with great facility the motion of tossing but with great difficulty that of bowing and therefore have justly acquired the title of stiffneckd in order to reduce such persons to a just balance he judged that the pair of muscles called recti interni the mastoidal with other flexors of the head neck and body must be strengthened their antagonists the splenii complexi and the extensors of the spine weakened for which purpose nature herself seems to have directed mankind to correct this muscular immorality by tying such fellows neckandheels  contrary to this is the pernicious custom of mothers who abolish the natural signature of modesty in their daughters by teaching them tossing and bridling rather than the bashful posture of stooping and hanging down the head martinus charged all husbands to take notice of the posture of the head of such as they courted to matrimony as that upon which their future happiness did much depend  flatterers who have the flexor muscles so strong that they are always bowing and cringing he supposed might in some measure be corrected by being tied down upon a tree by the back like the children of the indians which doctrine was strongly confirmed by his observing the strength of the levatores scapulae this muscle is called the muscle of patience because in that affection of mind people shrug and raise up the shoulder to the tip of the ear this muscle also he observed to be exceedingly strong and large in henpeckd husbands in italians and in english ministers  in pursuance of his theory he supposed the constrictors of the eyelids must be strengthened in the supercilious the abductors in drunkards and contemplative men who have the same steady and grave motion of the eye that the buccinatores or blowers up of the cheeks and the dilators of the nose were too strong in choleric people and therefore nature here again directed us to a remedy which was to correct such extraordinary dilatation by pulling by the nose  the rolling amorous eye in the passion of love might be corrected by frequently looking through glasses impertinent fellows that jump upon tables and cut capers might be cured by relaxing medicines applied to the calves of their legs which in such people are too strong  but there were two cases which he reckoned extremely difficult first affectation in which there were so many muscles of the bum thighs belly neck back and the whole body all in a false tone that it required an impracticable multiplicity of applications  the second case was immoderate laughter when any of that risible species were brought to the doctor and when he considered what an infinity of muscles these laughing rascals threw into a convulsive motion at the same time whether we regard the spasms of the diaphragm and all the muscles of respiration the horrible rictus of the mouth the distortion of the lower jaw the crisping of the nose twinkling of the eyes or sphaerical convexity of the cheeks with the tremulous succussion of the whole human body when he considered i say all this he used to cry out casus plane deplorabilis and give such patients over  chap xi the case of a young nobleman at court with the doctors prescription for the same an eminent instance of martinuss sagacity in discovering the distempers of the mind appeared in the case of a young nobleman at court who was observed to grow extremely affected in his speech and whimsical in all his behavior he began to ask odd questions talk in verse to himself shut himself up from his friends and be accessible to none but flatterers poets and pickpockets till his relations and old acquaintance judged him to be so far gone as to be a fit patient for the doctor  as soon as he had heard and examined all the symptoms he pronounced his distemper to be love  his friends assured him that they had with great care observed all his motions and were perfectly satisfied there was no woman in the case scriblerus was as positive that he was desperately in love with some person or other how can that be said his aunt who came to ask the advice when he converses almost with none but himself say you so he replied why then he is in love with himself one of the most common cases in the world i am astonished people do not enough attend this disease which has the same causes and symptoms and admits of the same cure with the other especially since here the case of the patient is the more helpless and deplorable of the two as this unfortunate passion is more blind than the other there are people who discover from their very youth a most amorous inclination to themselves which is unhappily nursed by such mothers as with their good will would never suffer their children to be crossed in love ease luxury and idleness blow up this flame as well as the other constant opportunities of conversation with the person beloved the greatest of incentives are here impossible to be prevented bawds and pimps in the other love will be perpetually doing kind offices speaking a good word for the party and carry about billet doux therefore i ask you madam if this gentleman has not been much frequented by flatterers and a sort of people who bring him dedications and verses o lord sir quoth the aunt the house is haunted with them there it is replied scriblerus those are the bawds and pimps that go between a man and himself are there no civil ladies that tell him he dresses well has a gentlemanly air and the like why truly sir my nephew is not awkward  look you madam this is a misfortune to him in former days these sort of lovers were happy in one respect that they never had any rivals but of late they have all the ladies so  be pleased to answer a few questions more whom does he generally talk of himself quoth the aunt whose wit and breeding does he most commend his own quoth the aunt whom does he write letters to himself whom does he dream of all the dreams i ever heard were of himself whom is he ogling yonder himself in his lookingglass why does he throw back his head in that languishing posture only to be blessed with a smile of himself as he passes by does he ever steal a kiss from himself by biting his lips oh continually till they are perfect vermilion have you observed him to use familiarities with any body with none but himself he often embraces himself with folded arms he claps his hand often upon his hip nay sometimes thrusts it into  his breast  madam said the doctor all these are strong symptoms but there remain a few more has this amorous gentleman presented himself with any lovetoys such as gold snuffboxes repeating watches or tweezercases those are things that in time will soften the most obdurate heart not only so said the aunt but he bought the other day a very fine brilliant diamond ring for his own wearing  nay if he has accepted of this ring the intrigue is very forward indeed and it is high time for friends to interpose pray madam a word or two more  is he jealous that his acquaintance do not behave themselves with respect enough will he bear jokes and innocent freedoms by no means a familiar appellation makes him angry if you shake him a little roughly by the hand he is in a rage but if you chuck him under the chin he will return you a box on the ear  then the case is plain he has the true pathognomick sign of love jealously for no body will suffer his mistress to be treated at that rate madam upon the whole this case is extremely dangerous there are some people who are far gone in this passion of selflove but then they keep a very secret intrigue with themselves and hide it from all the world besides but this patient has not the least care of the reputation of his beloved he is downright scandalous in his behavior with himself he is enchanted bewitched and almost past cure however let the following methods be tried upon him  first let him  hiatus  secondly let him wear a bobwig thirdly shun the company of flatterers nay of ceremonious people and of all frenchmen in general it would not be a miss if he traveled over england in a stagecoach and made the tour of holland in a trackscoute let him return the snuffboxes tweezercases and particularly the diamond ring which he has received from himself let some knowing friend represent to him the many vile qualities of this mistress of his let him be shown that her extravagance pride and prodigality will infallibly bring him to a morsel of bread let it be proved that he has been false to himself and if treachery is not a sufficient cause to discard a mistress what is in short let him be made to see that no mortal besides himself either loves or can suffer this creature let all lookingglasses polished toys and even clean plates beremoved from him for fear of bringing back the admired object let him be taught to put off all those tender airs affected smiles languishing looks wanton tosses of the head coy motions of the body that mincing gait soft tone of voice and all that enchanting womanlike behavior that has made him the charm of his own eyes and the object of his own adoration let him surprise the beauty he adores at a disadvantage survey himself naked divested of artificial charms and he will find himself a forked stradling animal with bandy legs a short neck a dun hide and a potbelly it would be yet better if he took a strong purge once a week in order to contemplate himself in that condition at which time it will be convenient to make use of the letters dedications etc abovesaid something like this has been observed by lucretius and others to be a powerful remedy in the case of women if all this will not do i must even leave the poor man to his destiny let him marry himself and when he is condemned eternally to himself perhaps he may run to the next pond to get rid of himself the fate of most violent selflovers  chap xii how martinus endeavored to find out the seat of the soul and of his correspondence with the freethinkers in this design of martin to investigate the diseases of the mind he thought nothing so necessary as an enquiry after the seat of the soul in which at first he labored under great uncertainties sometimes he was of opinion that it lodged in the brain sometimes in the stomach and sometimes in the heart afterward he thought it absurd to confine that sovereign lady to one apartment which made him infer that she shifted it according to the several functions of life the brain was her study the heart her stateroom and the stomach her kitchen but as he saw several offices of life went on at the same time he was forced to give up this hypothesis also he now conjectured it was more for the dignity of the soul to perform several operations by her little ministers the animal spirits from whence it was natural to conclude that she resides in different parts according to different inclinations sexes ages and professions thus in epicures he seated her in the mouth of the stomach philosophers have her in the brain soldiers in their heart women in their tongues fiddlers in their fingers and ropedancers in their toes at length he grew fond of the glandula pinealis dissecting many subjects to find out the different figure of this gland from whence he might discover the cause of the different tempers in mankind he supposed that in factious and restlessspirited people he should find it sharp and pointed allowing no room for the soul to repose herself that in quiet tempers it was flat smooth and soft affording to the soul as it were an easy cushion he was confirmed in this by observing that calves and philosophers tigers and statesmen foxes and sharpers peacocks and fops cocksparrows and coquets monkeys and players courtiers and spaniels moles and misers exactly resemble one another in the conformation of the pineal gland he did not doubt likewise to find the same resemblance in highwaymen and conquerors in order to satisfy himself in which it was that he purchased the body of one of the first species as has been before related at tyburn hoping in time to have the happiness of one of the latter too under his anatomical knife  we must not omit taking notice here that these enquiries into the seat of the soul gave occasion to his first correspondence with the society of freethinkers who were then in their infancy in england and so much taken with the promising endowments of martin that they ordered their secretary to write him the following letter  to the learned inquisitor into nature martinus scriblerus the society of freethinkers greeting grecian coffeehouse may   it is with unspeakable joy we have heard of your inquisitive genius and we think it great pity that it should not be better employed than in looking after that theological nonentity commonly called the soul since after all your enquiries it will appear you have lost your labor in seeking the residence of such a chimera that never had being but in the brains of some dreaming philosophers is it not demonstration to a person of your sense that since you cannot find it there is no such thing in order to set so hopeful a genius right in this matter we have sent you an answer to the illgrounded sophisms of those crackbraind fellows and likewise an easy mechanical explanation of perception or thinking  one of their chief arguments is that selfconsciousness cannot inhere in any system of matter because all matter is made up of several distinct beings which never can make up one individual thinking being  this is easily answered by a familiar instance in every jack there is a meatroasting quality which neither resides in the fly nor in the weight nor in any particular wheel of the jack but is the result of the whole composition so in an animal the selfconsciousness is not a real quality inherent in one being any more than meatroasting in a jack but the result of several modes or qualities in the same subject as the fly the wheels the chain the weight the cords etc make one jack so the several parts of the body make one animal as perception or consciousness is said to be inherent in this animal so is meatroasting said to be inherent in the jack as sensation reasoning volition memory etc are the several modes of thinking so roasting of beef roasting of mutton roasting of pullets geese turkeys etc are the several modes of meatroasting and as the general quality of meatroasting with its several modifications as to beef mutton pullets etc does not inhere in any one part of the jack so neither does consciousness with its several modes of sensation intellection volition etc inhere in any one but is the result from the mechanical composition of the whole animal  just so the quality or disposition in a fiddle to play tunes with the several modifications of this tuneplaying quality in playing of preludes sarabands jigs and gavotts are as much real qualities in the instrument as the thought or the imagination is in the mind of the person that composes them  the parts say they of an animal body are perpetually changed and the fluids which seem to be subject of consciousness are in a perpetual circulation so that the same individual particles do not remain in the brain from whence it will follow that the idea of individual consciousness must be constantly translated from one particle of matter to another whereby the particle a for example must not only be conscious but conscious that it is the same being with the particle b that went before  we answer this is only a fallacy of the imagination and is to be understood in no other sense than that maxim of the english law that the king never dies this power of thinking selfmoving and governing the whole machine is communicated from every particle to its immediate successor who as soon as he is gone immediately takes upon him the government which still preserves the unity of the whole system  they make a great noise about this individuality how a man is conscious to himself that he is the same individual he was twenty years ago notwithstanding the flux state of the particles of matter that compose his body we think this is capable of a very plain answer and may be easily illustrated by a familiar example  sir john cutler had a pair of black worsted stockings which his maid darnd so often with silk that they became at last a pair of silk stockings now supposing those stockings of sir johns endued with some degree of consciousness at every particular darning they would have been sensible that they were the same individual pair of stockings both before and after the darning and this sensation would have continued in them through all the succession of darnings and yet after the last of all there was not perhaps one thread left of the first pair of stockings but they were grown to be silk stockings as was said before  and whereas it is affirmed that every animal is conscious of some individual selfmoving selfdetermining principle it is answered that as in a house of commons all things are determined by a majority so it is in every animal system as that which determines the house is said to be the reason of the whole assembly it is no otherwise with thinking beings who are determined by the greater force of several particles which like so many unthinking members compose one thinking system  and whereas it is likewise objected that punishments cannot be just that are not inflicted upon the same individual which cannot subsist without the notion of a spiritual substance we reply that this is no greater difficulty to conceive than that a corporation which is likewise a flux body may be punished for the faults and liable to the debts of their predecessors  we proceed now to explain by the structure of the brain the several modes of thinking it is well known to anatomists that the brain is a congeries of glands that separate the finer parts of the blood called animal spirits that a gland is nothing but a canal of a great length variously intorted and wound up together from the arietadion and motion of the spirits in those canals proceed all the different sorts of thoughts simple ideas are produced by the motion of the spirits in one simple canal when two of these canals disembogue themselves into one they make what we call a proposition and when two of these propositional channels empty themselves into a third they form a syllogism or a ratiocination memory is performed in a distinct apartment of the brain made up of vessels similar and like situated to the ideal propositional and syllogistical vessels in the primary parts of the brain after the same manner it is easy to explain the other modes of thinking as also why some people think so wrong and perversely which proceeds from the bad configuration of those glands some for example are born without the propositional or syllogistical canals in others that reason ill they are of unequal capacities in dull fellows of too great a length whereby the motion of the spirits is retarded in trifling geniuss weak and small in the overrefining spirits too much intorted and winding and so of the rest  we are so much persuaded of the truth of this our hypothesis that we have employed one of our members a great virtuoso at nuremberg to make a sort of an hydraulick engine in which a chimical liquor resembling blood is driven through elastick channels resembling arteries and veins by the force of an embolus like the heart and wrought by a pneumatick machine of the nature of the lungs with ropes and pullies like the nerves tendons and muscles and we are persuaded that this our artificial man will not only walk and speak and perform most of the outward actions of the animal life but being wound up once a week will perhaps reason as well as most of your country parsons  we wait with the utmost impatience for the honor of having you a member of our society and beg leave to assure you that we are etc   what return martin made to this obliging letter we must defer to another occasion let it suffice at present to tell that crambe was in a great rage at them for stealing as he thought a hint from his theory of syllogisms without doing him the honor so much as to mention him he advised his master by no means to enter into their society unless they would give him sufficient security to bear him harmless from any thing that might happen after this present life  chap xiv the double mistress n b the style of this chapter in the original memoirs is so singularly different from the rest that it is hard to conceive by whom it was penned but if we consider the particular regard which our philosopher had for it who expressly directed that not one word of this chapter should be altered it will be natural to suspect that it was written by himself at the time when love ever delighting in romances had somewhat tinctured his style and that the remains of his first and srongest passion gave him a partiality to this memorial of it thus it begins  but now the successful course of the studies of martin was interrupted by love love that unnerves the vigor of the hero and softens the severity of the philosopher it chanced that as martin was walking forth to inhale the fresh breeze of the evening after the long and severe studies of the day and passing through the western confines of the famous metropolis of albion not far from the proud battlements of the palace of whitehall whose walls are embraced by the silver thames his eyes were drawn upwards by a large square piece of canvas which hung forth to the view of the passing citizens upon it was pourtrayed by some accurate pencil the lybian leopard more fierce than in his native desert the mighty lion who boasted thrice the bulk of the nemaean monster before whom stood the little jackall the faithful spy of the king of beasts near these was placed of two cubits high the black prince of monomotapa by whose side were seen the glaring catamountain the quilldarting porcupine and the manmimicking manteger close adjoining to this hung another piece of canvas on which was displayed the pourtrait of two bohemian damsels whom nature had as closely united as the ancient hermaphroditus and salmacis and whom it was as impossible to divide as the mingled waters of the gentle thames and the amorous isis while martin stood in a meditating posture feasting his eyes on this picture he heard on a sudden the sonorous notes of a clarion which seemed of the purest crystal in an instant the passing multitude flocked to the sound as when a drum summons the straggling soldiers to the approaching battle the youthful virtuoso who was in daily pursuit of the curiosities of nature was immediately surrounded by the gazing throng the doors for ever barred to the pennyless populace seemed to open themselves at his producing a silver sixpence which like aeneass golden bough gained him admission into that scene of wonders he no sooner entered the first apartment but his nostrils were struck with the scent of carnage broken bones and naked carcasses bestrowd the floor the majestic lion roused from his bed and shook his brindled mane the spotted leopard gnashd his angry teeth and walking to and fro in indignation rattled his chains martin with infinite pleasure heard the history of the several monsters which was courteously opened to him by a person of a grave and earnest mien whose frank behavior and ready answers discovered him to have been long conversant with different nations and to have journeyd through distant regions by him he was informed that the lion was hunted on the hills of lebanon by the basha of jerusalem that the leopard was nursed in the uninhabited woods of lybia the porcupine came from the kingdom of presterjohn and the manteger was a true descendant of the celebrated hanniman the magnificent sir said mr randal for that was the name of the master of the show the whole world cannot match these prodigies twice have i sailed round the globe these feet have traversed the most remote and barbarous nations and i can with conscience affirm that not all the deserts of the four quarters of the earth furnish out a more complete set of animals than what are contained within these walls friend answered martin bold is thy assertion and wonderful is the knowledge of a traveller but did thou ever risque thy self among the pliny lib   cap   scythian canibals or those wild men of abarimon who walk with their feet backwards have thou ever seen the sciopi so called because when laid supine they shelter themselves from the sunbeams with the shadow of their feet can thou procure me a troglodyte footman who can catch a roe at his full speed have thou ever beheld those illyrian damsels who have two sights in one eye whose looks are poisonous to males that are adult have thou ever measured the gigantick ethiopian whose stature is above eight cubits high or the sesquipedalian pigmey have thou ever seen any of the cynocephali who have the head and voice of a dog and whose pilny    milk is the only true specific for consumptions sir replied mr randal all these have i beheld upon my honor and many more which are set forth in my journal as for your dogfacd men they are no other than what stands before you that is naturally the fiercest but by art the tamest manteger in the world that word replies martin is a corruption of the aelian lib   cap   pliny lib    cap    pliny lib   cap  0 lib   cap    aelian lib   cap    aelian lib   cap    aelian lib   cap   mantichora of the ancients the most noxious animal that ever infested the earth who had a sting above a cubit long and would attack a rank of armed men at once flinging his poisonous darts several miles around him can thou inform me whether the boars grunt in macedonia can thou give me a certificate that the lions in africa are afraid of the scolding of women have thou ever heard the sagacious hyaena counterfeit the voice of a shepherd imitate the vomiting of a man to draw the dogs together and even call a shepherd by his proper name your crocodile is but a small one but you ought to have brought with him the bird trochilos that picks his teeth after dinner at which the silly animal is so pleased that he gapes wide enough to give the ichneumon his mortal enemy an entrance into his belly your modern ostriches are dwindled to mere larks in comparison with those of the ancients theirs were equal in stature to a man on horseback alas we have lost the chaste bird porphyrion the whole race was destroyed by women because they discovered the infidelity of wives to their husbands the merops too is now no where to be found the only bird that flew backward by the tail but say can thou inform me what dialect of the greek is spoken by the birds of diomedesisland for it is from them only we can learn the true pronunciation of that ancient language  mr randal made no satisfactory answer to these demands but harangued chiefly upon modern monsters and seemed willing to confine his instances to the animals of his own collection pointing to each of them in order with his rod  after martin had satisfied his curiosity here he was conducted into another apartment just at the entrance of the door appeared a negroe prince his habiliments bespoke him royal his head was crowned with the feather of an ostrich his sable feet and legs were interlaced with purple and gold spangled with the diamonds of cornwall and the precious stones of bristol though his stature was of the lowest yet he behaved himself with such an air of grandeur as gave evident tokens of his regal birth and education he was mounted upon the lest palfrey in the universe a palfrey whose natural beauty stood not in need of those various colored ribbons which braided his mane and were interwoven with his tail again the crystal clarion founded and after several courteous speeches between the black prince and martin our youthful philosopher walked into the midst of the room to bless his sight with the most beautiful curiosity of nature on a sudden entered at another door the two bohemian sisters whose common parts of generation had so closely allied them that nature seemed here to have conspired with fortune that their lives should run in an eternal parallel  the sun had twice eight times performed his annual course since their mother brought them into the world with double pangs lindamiras eyes were of a lively blue indamoras were black and piercing lindamiras cheeks might rival the blush of the morning in indamora the lilly overcame the rose lindamiras tresses were of the paler gold while the locks of indamora were black and glossy as the plumes of a raven  how great is the power of love in human breasts in vain has the wise man recourse to his reason when the insinuating arrow touches his heart and the pleasing poison is diffused through his veins but then how violent how transporting must that passion prove where not only the fire of youth but the unquenchable curiosity of a philosopher pitched upon the same object for how much soever our martin was enamored on her as a beautiful woman he was infinitely more ravished with her as a charming monster what wonder then if his gentle spirit already humanizd by a polite education to receive all soft impressions and fired by the sight of those beauties so lavishly exposed to his view should prove unable to resist at once so pleasing a passion and so amiable a phenomenon  martin who felt the true emotions of love blushed that the object of his flame should be so openly prostituted to vulgar eyes and though he had been permitted to peruse her most secret charms yet his honorable passion was so strong that it ran into the extreme of bashfulness so that at the first interview he made no overtures of his love pensive he returned and flinging himself on his couch passed away the tedious hours of the night in the utmost inquietude the rushy taper afforded a glimmering light by which he contemplated the tender lines of ovid but alas his remedy of love was no cure for our unhappy lovers anxiety he closed the amorous volume sighed and casting his eyes around on the books that adorned his room broke forth in this pathetic apostrophe  o ye spirits of antiquity who yet live in those sacred leaves why do i make you conscious of my shame yet why should i depreciate the noble passion of love and call it shame your heroes have felt it your poets and orators have praised it were i enamored on some gaudy virgin did i dote on vulgar perfection the luster of an eye or the rose of a cheek with reason might i blush before you most learned inquisitors into nature most reverend pliny aelian and aldrovandus yet sure you cannot disapprove of this which is no wanton passion but excited by so unparalled a production a flame that may not only justify itself to the severity of a philosopher but even to the avarice of a parent since she who causes it carries a most plentiful fortune in the sole exhibition of her person heavens how i wonder at the stupidity of mankind who can affix the opprobrious name of monstrosity to what is only variety of beauty and a profusion of generous nature if there are charms in one face one mouth one body if there are charms in two eyes two breasts two arms are they not all redoubled in the object of my passion what thoshe be the common gaze of the multitude and is followed about by the stupid and ignorant does she not herein resemble the greatest princes and the greatest beauties only with this difference that her admirers are more numerous and more lasting  thus sighed he away the melancholy night but no sooner had aurora with blushes in her cheeks as conscious that she was just risen from the embraces of tithon advanced through the purple gates of the east but martin rose he rose indeed but melancholy the companion of his slumbers rose and waked with him this was the first day that he amused himself with the gaudy ornaments of the body that with secret pleasure he contemplated his face and the symmetry of his limbs in a lookingglass and now forsaking his solitary apartment he walked directly to the habitation that confined the object of his desires but as it is observed that the curious never wander into the city to indulge their thirst of knowledgetill about the hours of eleven or twelve the morning has ever been the season of repose for all those animals who trapannd by the frauds of men have been obliged to change their woods and wildernesses for lodgings in cities at the rate of four shillings a week therefore martin at this early hour was neither saluted by the sound of the trumpet nor were his eyes feasted as before with the pleasing picture of his mistress but he walked to and fro before the door with folded arms from the hour of five to eleven humming in a low and melancholy tune  the trumpet no sooner sounded but his heart leapt for joy and a second sixpence gained him a second admittance into her apartment yet this day also he only owned his passion in the language of his eyes but alas this language is only understood by those that love and lindamira remained still ignorant of his passion  in the mean time it was no small cause of wonder to mr randal that this gentleman should come every day to behold the same show he no less covetous than the guardian of a rich heiress entertained a suspicion that martin had a design of stealing the ladies he thereupon issued out strict orders not to admit our lover on any pretense whatsoever what torments must this occasion in the raging fever of love martin had now recourse to stratagem and by a bribe which often even the ermine and scarlet robe cannot resist gained the dwarf who kept the gates of the showroom to promote his amor he promised to convey a letter to lindamira the same evening if he would bring it him when darkness favored his design at the apartment next the monsters martin overjoyed hasted home and after having consulted all the authors that treat of love composed his billetdoux and at the time appointed went to entrust it to the hands of his confident softly he stole up stairs approached the door and gave a gentle rap when on a sudden a small hand was thrust through a little hole at the bottom of the door whence issued an unintelligible squeaking voice martin concluding it to be the signal delivered his epistle and made his retreat unobserved he was no sooner retired but mr randal entered and as it was his usual custom before he went to bed took a view if all were safe in the showroom at his coming in he saw his monkey exceedingly busy in picking the sealwax by little bits from a letter which he turned over and over with infinite satisfaction mr randal not thinking it a breach of honor to pry into the secrets of his own family took the letter from him and read as follows  to the most amiable lindamira while others o darling of nature look upon thee with the eyes of curiosity i behold thee with those of love since i have been struck with thy most astonishing charms how have i called upon nature to make a new head new arms and a new body to sprout from this single trunk of mine and to double every member so to render me a proper mate for so lovely a pair but think to how little purpose it will be for thee to stay till nature shall form another of thy kind in such beauties she exhausts her whole art and cannot afford to be prodigal ages must be numbered nay perhaps some comet may vitrify this globe on which we tread before we behold a castor and a pollux resembling the beauteous lindamira and indamora nature forms her wonders for the wise and such a masterpiece she could design for none but a philosopher cease then to display those beauties to the profane vulgar which were created to crown the desires of  your passionate admirer martinus scriblerus   the dwarf entered as he was reading the letter and perceiving his master moved with passion immediately fell on his knees and confessed the whole affair mr randal bent on revenge caused him to hasten to martins house with assurances that lindamira had read his letter with infinite satisfaction and conjured him that he would immediately favor her escape martin overjoyed at the news flew thither on the wings of love the perfidious dwarf conducted him up stairs in the dark gently opened the door and bad him enter how happy was martin in that instant who thought of nothing but leaping into the four soft arms of his mistress when lo on a sudden he saw at the further end of the room two glittering balls of fire which rolled to and fro in a most terrible manner immediately his ears were invaded with horrid hissings and spittings the balls of fire drew nearer him and the noise redoubled as he approached our philosopher bold and resolute with love ventured toward it when all at once he perceived something grasp him hard by the throat and fix as it were sharp lances in his cheek so that blood trickled amain down his chin thrice martin essayed to free himself but vain were all his endeavors till at length to save his life he was forced to betray his intrigue and alarm the house with reiterated cries of murder the apartment of the bohemian beauties being the adjoining room they were the first that entered with a light to his assistance martin all bloody as he was a most fierce catamountain hanging at his chin which mr randal had maliciously placed there on purpose at the sight of lindamira forgot his distress ah my love he cried how like is thy fate to that of thisbe who staying but a moment too late found as she thought her miserable lover torn in pieces by a savage beast the affrighted damsels skriekd aloud mr randal with all his retinue rushed into the room and now every hand conspired to free his underjaw from the sharp teeth of the enragedmonster but the lady whose heart melted at the piteous spectacle was so zealous in this office of humanity that the catamountain provoked at her goodnatured diligence leaped furiously on her and wounded three of her hands and her two noses to such a barbarous degree that she was not fit to be shown publicly for the space of three weeks the generous lover more wounded at this spectacle than at all the scratches he had himself received charged the monster again with the utmost intrepidity and rescued his mangled mistress then having taken her by the hand and given it a gentle grasp he retreated with his eye fixed upon her and just as he left the room in a low and tender accent thus breathed forth his soul behold all this have i suffered for you  such and so modest was the first declaration of love made on this eminent occasion by our youthful philosopher nor was it ungently received by the simple and innocent lindamira who hitherto unused to the soft protestations of adoring slaves had rather been wondered at than beloved and received but imperfect notions of that tender language from the addresses only of the black prince or the dwarf  martin notwithstanding this unfortunate adventure still pursued his wishes his letters were now no more intercepted lindamira read them and behaved like other courteous dames when they receive those amorous testimonials concealed them from her guardian and returned the most engaging answers in short she was so far captivated as to resolve no longer to be gazed at like a public beauty in her own assembly but retire from the world and become the virtuous mistress of a family  but fate had so ordained that martin was not more enamoured on lindamira than indamora was on martin she jealous that her sister had the greatest share in this conquest resented that an equal application had not been made to herself she teizd lindamira to such a degree on this subject as made her promise to see martin no more but then again might indamora be deemed the unhappiest of women whom her passion and imprudence had robbed of the sight of her lover yet shame caused her to conceal those anxieties from her sister and let the reader judge how unhappy the nymph must be who was even deprived the universal relief of a soliloquy however thus she thought without being allowed to tell it to any grove or purling stream  wretched indamora if lindamira must never more see martin martin shall never again bless the eyes of indamora yet why do i say wretched since my rival can never possess my lover without me the pangs that others feel in absence from the thought of those joys that bless their rivals can never sting thy bosom nor can they mortify thee by making thee a witness without giving thee at the same time a share of their endearments change then thy proceeding indamora thy jealousy must act a new and unheard of part and promote the interest of thy rival as the only way to the enjoyment of thy lover  from that moment she studied by all methods to advance her sisters amor and in that her own and thus there appeared in these three lovers as extraordinary a conjunction of passions as of persons love had reconciled himself to his mortal foes to philosophy in martin and to jealousy in indamora  and now flourished the amor of martin success even prevented his wishes the marriage was agreed on and the day appointed sunday was the time when mr randals absence favored their hopes who never on that day omitted taking the fresh air in the fields the key of the door he always took with him crambe was ready laid at a convenient distance who accommodated them with a ladder of ropes the ladder was thrown up and the signal given at the window lindamira hastened to the alarm of love when behold a new disaster as she was getting out of the window the weight of her body on one side and that of indamoras on the other unluckily caused them to stick in the midway lindamira hung with her coats stripped up to the navel without and indamora in no less immodest posture within the manteger who for his gentleness was allowed to walk at large in the house was so heightened at this sight that he rushed upon indamora like a barborous ravisher indamora cried aloud for help martin flew to revenge this insolent attempt of a rape on his wedding day the lustful monster driven from our double lucrece fled into the middle of the room pursued by the valorous and indignant martin three times the hot manteger frighted at the furious menaces of his antagonist made a circle round the chamber and three times the swiftfooted martin pursued him he caught up the horn of a unicorn which lay ready for the entertainment of the curious spectator and brandishing it over his head in airy circles hurled it against the hairy son of hanniman who wrinkling his brown forehead and gnashing his teeth in indignation stooped low the horny lance just razed his left shoulder and stuck into the tapestry hangings provoked at this the grinning offspring of hanniman caught up the pointed horn of an antelope and aimed a blow against his undismayed adversary our heroic lover who held his hat before him like a shield received the weapon full on the crown it pierced the beaver and gave a small rent to his breeches then the human champion flung with mighty violence the hinder foot of an elk which hit the bestial combatant full on the nether jaw he reeled but soon recovering and his skill in war lying rather in the close fight than in projectile weapons he endeavored to close with him forthwith assailing him behind unawares he clamberd up his back and plucked up by the roots a mighty grasp of hair  but martin soon dismounted him and kept him at a distance love not only inspired his breast with courage but gave double strength to his sinews he heaved up the hand of a prodigious sea monster which when the chattring champion beheld he no less furious wielded the ponderous thigh bone of a giant and now they stood opposed to each other like the dread captain of the sevenfold shield and the redoubted hector the thigh bone missed its aim but the hand of the sea monster descended directly on the head of the sylvian ravisher the monster chatterd horribly he stretched his quivering limbs on the floor and eternal sleep locked fast his eyelids  the lady from the window like another helen from the trojan wall was witness of the combat caused by her own beauty she saw with what gracefulness her hero entered the lists admired his activity and courage in the combat and was a joyful witness of his triumph she gave a spring from the window and with open arms and legs embraced the neck and shoulders of her champion our philosopher received her with his face turned modestly from her and in that manner conveyed her into the street he called a chair with all haste but no chairman would take her which obliged him to bear his extraordinary burden till he found a coach in which he carried her off and was happily united to her that very evening by a reverend clergyman in the fleet in the holy bands of matrimony  chap xv of the strange and never to be paralleled process at law upon the marriage of scriblerus and the pleadings of the advocates but nemesis who delights in traversing the bestlaid designs of cupid maliciously contrived the means to make these three lovers unhappy no sooner had the master of the show received notice of their flight but he seized on the bohemian ladies by a warrant and not content with having recovered the possession of them resolved to open all the sluices of the law upon martin so he instantly went to council to advise upon all possible methods of revenge  the first point he proceeded on was the property of his monster and the question propounded was an servi possint invitis dominis matrimonium contrahere  whether slaves could marry without the consent of their master to this he was answered in the affirmative but told at the same time  that an servus matrimonio eximitur a domini obsequio the marriage did not exempt them from servitude  this put him in no small hopes of having martin added to his show and acquiring a property in his bodily issue by the ladies but his joy was soon dashed when he was informed that since martin was a free man an liberi sequuntur conditionem patris an matris  the children must follow the condition of the father or that indeed if they were to follow that of their mother the case would be the same there being no slavery in england  then his counsel judged it more advisable to plead for a dissolution of the marriage upon the impossibility of conjugal dues in the wife but then the canon law allowed a triennal cohabitation which entirely ruined this project also besides it was evident by the same law that  monstrosity could not incapacitate from marriage witness the case of hermaphrodites who are allowed  facultatem conjugii provided they make election before the parish priest in what sex they will act and take an oath never to perform in the other capacity sanchez hostiens sylvest   it was next consulted whether martin should not be permitted to take away his wife since upon his so doing  he might be sued for a rape upon the body of her sister there being plainly the four conditions of a violentia causa libidinis traductio ad locum mulier honesta rape but then again they considered that martin might answer he claimed nothing but his own and if another person had fixed herself to his wife he must not for that cause be debarred the use of his property  yet still upon the same head of martins possessing his spouse a suit might be devised in the name of lindamira on this account uxor non tenetur vivere cum viro concubinam tenente that a  wife was not obliged to live with a concubine and such her sister indamora must be accounted to martin from the common tactus amplexus cohabitatio proofs to this too it was replied that the law ordered the wife to reside with the husband if there were sufficient security given to expel the concubine so martin might say he was ready to accomplish his part of the covenant if his wife would perform hers and consent to the an uxor tenetur incisionem pati sanchez de matrimonio incision but this being an impossibility on the side of the wife it could no way be exacted of the husband  at length mr randal being vexed at the heart to have been so long and so quaintly disappointed determined to commence a suit against martin for bigamy and incest mean while he left no artifice or address untried to perplex the unhappy philosopher he even contrived with infinite cunning to alienate indamoras affections from him and debauched her into an intrigue with a creature of his own the black prince whom he secretly caused to marry her while her sister was asleep  hereupon martin was reduced to turn plaintiff and commenced a suit in the spiritual court against the black prince for cohabitation with his said wife he was advised to insist upon a new point viz  that lindamira and indamora together made up but one lawful wife  the monstermaster further to distress martin forced lindamira to petition for aliment lite pendente which was no sooner allowed her by the court but he obliged her to allege that  it was not sufficient to maintain both herself and her sister and if her sister perished she could not live with the dead body about her  martin now began to repent that he had not executed a resolution he formerly conceived of marrying crambe to indamora as an expedient to have made all secure moreover it was insisted on that the other also had a right to aliment  because if martins wife should prove with child the said sister must necessarily perform the offices of a wife in contributing to the nutrition and gestation of the said child a jury of physicians being impanneld declared that as to nutrition they were doubtful whether any blood of lindamira circulated through indamora but as to gestation it was evidently true and upon this martin was ordered to allow aliment to both the black prince appearing insolvent  then the court proceeded to the trial and as both the cause and the pleadings are of an extraordinary nature we think sit here to insert them at length  dr pennyfeather thus pleaded for martinus scriblerus the plaintiff  dr pennyfeather   i appear before your honor in behalf of martinus scriblerus bachelor of physic in a complaint against ebnhaipawwaw commonly called the black prince of monopotapa inasmuch as the said ebnhaipawwaw has maliciously forcibly and unlawfully seized ravished and detained lindamiraindamora the wife of the said martin and the body of the said lindamiraindamora from time to time ever since has wickedly leudly and indecently used handled and evil entreated and in order to make this his villainy more lasting has presumed to marry this our wife pretending to give his wickedness the sanction of a law and forasmuch as the adulterer does not deny the fact but insists upon his said marriage as lawful we cannot open the case more plainly to your honor than by answering his reasons which indeed to mention is to confute   he maintains no less an absurdity than this that one is two and that lindamiraindamora the individual wife of the plaintiff is not one but two persons and that the said ebnhaipawwaw is not married to lindamira the wife of the said martin but to his own lawful wife indamora another individual person distinct from the said lindamira though joined to her by a strong ligament of nature  in answer whereunto we shall prove three things  first that the said lindamiraindamora now our lawful wife makes but one individual person   secondly that if they made two individual persons yet they constitute but one wife   thirdly that supposing they made two individual persons and two wives each lawfully married to her own husband yet prince ebnhaipawwaw has no right to detain lindamira our lawfully wedded wife on pretense of being married to indamora  as to the first point  it will be necessary to determine the constituent principle and essence of individuality which in respect of mankind we take to be one simple identical soul in one simple identical body the individuality sameness or identity of the body is not determined as some vainly imagine by one head and a certain number of arms legs and other members but in one simple single  or member of generation   let us search profane history and we shall find geryon with three heads and briareus with an hundred hands let us search sacred history and we meet with one of the sons of the giants with six fingers to each hand and six toes to each foot yet none never accounted geryon or briareus more than one person and give us leave to say the wife of the said geryon would have had a good action against any women who should have espoused themselves to the two other heads of that monarch the reason is plain because each of these having but one simple  or one member of generation could be looked upon but as one single person   in conformity to this when we behold this one member we distinguish the sex and pronounce it a man or a woman or as the latins express it unus vir una mulier une homme une femme one man one woman for the same reason man and wife are said to be one flesh because united in that part which constitutes the sameness and individuality of each sex   and as where there is but one member of generation there is but one body so there can be but one soul because the said organ of generation is the seat of the soul and consequently where there is but one such organ there can be but one soul let me here say without injury to truth that no philosopher either of the past or present age has taken more pains to discover where the soul keeps her residence than the plaintiff the learned martinus scriblerus and after his most diligent enquiries and experiments he has been verily persuaded that the organ of generation is the true and only seat of the soul that this part is seated in the middle and near the center of the whole body is obvious to your honors view from thence like the sun in the center of the world the soul dispenses her warmth and vital influence let the brain glory in the wisdom of the aged the science of the learned the policy of the statesman and the invention of the witty the accidental amusements and emanations of the soul and mortal as the possessors of them it is to the organs of generation that we owe man himself there the soul is employed in works suitable to the dignity of her nature and as we may say sits brooding over ages ye unborn   we need not tell your honor that it has been the opinion of many most learned divines and philosophers that the soul as well as body is produced ex traduce this doctrine has been defended by arguments irrefragable and accounts for difficulties without it inexplicable all which arguments conclude with equal strength for the souls being seated in the organs of generation for since the whole man both soul and body is there formed and since nothing can operate but where it is it follows that the soul must reside in that individual place where she exerts her generative and plastic powers   this our doctrine is confirmed by all those experiments which conspire to prove the absolute dominion which that part has over the whole body we see how many women who are deaf to the persuasions of the eloquent the insinuations of the crafty and the threats of the imperious are easily governed by some poor loggerhead unfurnished with the least art but that of making immediate application to this seat of the soul the impressions made by the ear are so distant and transmitted through so many windings that they lose their energy but your honor by immediately applying to the organ of generation acts like a bold and wife petitioner who goes strait to the very throne and judgment seat of the monarch   and whereas it is objected that here are two wills and therefore two different persons we answer if multiplicity of wills implied multiplicity of persons there are few husbands but what are guilty of poligamy there being in the same woman great and notorious diversity of wills a point which we shall not need to insist upon before any married person much less of your honors experience   thus have we made good our first and principal point that if the wife of the plaintiff lindamiraindamora has but one organ of generation she is but one individual person in the truest and most proper sense of individuality and that the matter of fact is so we are willing to put upon a fair trial by a jury of matrons whom your honor shall think fit to nominate and appoint to inspect the body of the said lindamiraindamora   secondly we are to prove that though lindamiraindamora were two individual persons consisting each of a soul and body yet if they have but one organ of generation they can constitute but one wife for from whence can the unity of any thing be denominated but from that which constitutes the essence or principal use of it thus if a knife or hatchet have but one blade though two handles it will properly be denominated but one knife or one hatchet inasmuch as it has but one of that which constitutes the essence or principal use of a knife or hatchet so if there were not only one but twenty supposita rationalia with one common organ of generation that one system would only make one wife upon the whole let not a few heads legs or arms extraordinary biass your honors judgment and deprive the plaintiff of his legal property in which right our client is so strongly fortified that allowing both the former propositions to be false and that there were two persons two bodies two rational souls yea and two organs of generation yet would it still be plain in the third place   that the defendant prince ebnhaipawwaw can have no right to detain from the plaintiff his lawfully wedded wife lindamira for abstracting from the priority of the marriage of our client by which it would seem he acquired a property in his wife and all other matter inseparably annexed unto her it is evident prince ebnhaipawwaw by his marriage to indamora could never acquire any property in lindamira nor can produce any cause why both of them should live with himself rather than with the other therefore we humbly hope your honor will order the body of our said wife to be restored to us and due censure past on the said ebnhaipawwaw  dr pennyfeather having thus ended his pleading was thus answered by  dr leatherhead   i will not trouble your honor with any unnecessary preamble or false colors of eloquence which truth has no need of and which would prove too thin a veil for falsehood before the penetrating eyes of your honor in answer therefore to what our learned brother dr pennyfeather has asserted we shall labor to demonstrate   first that though there were but one organ of generation yet are there two distinct persons   secondly that although there were but one organ of generation so far would it be from giving the plaintiff any right to the body of indamora the wife of ebnhaipawwaw that it will subject the plaintiff to the penalty of incest or of bigamy   thirdly we doubt not to prove that the said lindamiraindamora has two distinct parts of generation   and first we will show that neither the individual essence of mankind nor the seat of the soul does reside in the organ of generation and this first from reason for unreasonable indeed must it be to make that the seat of the rational soul which alone sets us on a level with beasts or to conceive that the essence of unity and individuality should consist in that which is the source of discord and division in a word what can be a greater absurdity than to affirm bestiality to be the essence of humanity darkness the center of light and filthiness the seat of purity   we could from the authority of the mos eminent philosophers of all ages confirm this our assertion few of whom ever had the impudence to degrade this queen the rational soul to the very lowest and vilest apartment or rather sink of her whole palace but we shall produce fill a greater authority than these to manifest that personal individuality did subsist when there was no such generative carnality   it has been strenuously maintained by many holy divines and particularly by thomas aquinas that our first parents in the state of innocence did in no wife propagate their species after the present common manner of men and beasts but that the propagation at that time must have been by intuition coalition of ideas or some pure and spiritual manner suitable to the dignity of their station and though the sexes were distinguished in that state yet it is plain it was not by parts such as we have at present since if our first parents had any such they must have known it and it is written that they discovered them not till after the fall when it is probable those parts were the immediate excrescence of sin and only grew forth to render them fitter companions for those a beasts among which they were driven   it is a maxim in philosophy that generatio unius est corruption alterius whence it is apparent that the paradisaical generation was of a different nature from ours free from all corruption and imbecility this is further corroborated by the authority of those doctors of the church who have asserted that before the fall adam was endowed with a continual uninterrupted faculty of generation which can be explained of no other than of that intuitive generation above said since it is well known to all the least skilled in anatomy that the present male part of generation is utterly incapable of this continual faculty   we come now to our second point wherein the advocate for the plaintiff asserteth that if there were two persons and one organ of generation this system would constitute but one wife this will put the plaintiff still in a worse condition and render him plainly guilty of bigamy rape or incest for if there be but one such organ of generation then both the persons of lindamira and indamora have an equal property in it and what is indamoras property cannot be disposed of without her consent we therefore bring the whole to this short issue whether the plaintiff martinus scriblerus had the consent of indamora or not if he has had her consent he is guilty of bigamy if not he is guilty of a rape or incest or both   the defendant prince ebnhaipawwaw having been lately baptized has with singular modesty abstained from consummation with his said wife until he shall be satisfied from the opinion of your honor his learned judge how far in law and conscience he may proceed and therefore he cannot affirm much nor positively as to the structure of the organ of generation of this his wife indamora yet make we no doubt that it will upon inspection appear that the said organ is distinct from that of lindamira whereupon we crave to hear the report of the jury of matrons appointed to inspect the body of the said gentlewoman   and if the matter of fact be thus give me your honors permission to repeat what has been said by the advocate for the plaintiff to wit that martinus scriblerus bachelor in physic by this his marriage with lindamira could in no wise acquire any property in the body of indamora not show any cause why this duplicated wife lindamiraindamora should abide with him rather than with the defendant prince ebnhaipawwaw of monomotapa  the jury of matrons having made their report and it appearing from thence that the parts of generation in lindamira and indamora were distinct the judge took time to deliberate and the next courtday he spoke to this effect  gentlemen   i am of opinion that lindamira and indamora are distinct persons and that both the marriages are good and valid therefore i order you martinus scriblerus bachelor in physic and you ebnhaipawwaw prince of monomotapa to cohabit with your wives and to lie in bed each on the side of his own wife i hope gentlemen you will seriously consider that you are under a stricter tie than common brothersinlaw that being as it were joint proprietors of one common tenement you will so behave as good fellowlodgers ought to do and with great modesty each to his respective sisterinlaw abstaining from all further familiarities than what conjugal duties do naturally oblige you to consider also by how small limits the duty and the trespass is divided lest while ye discharge the duty of matrimony ye heedlessly slide into the sin of adultery  this sentence pleased neither party and martin appealed from the consistory to the court of arches but they confirmed the sentence of the consistory  it was at last brought before a commission of delegates who having weighed the case reversed the sentence of the inferior courts and disannulled the marriage upon the following reasons  that allowing the manner of cohabitation enjoined to be practicable though highly inconvenient yet the jus petendi and reddendi debitum conjugale being at all times equal in both husbands and both wives and at the same time impossible in more than one two persons could not have a right to the entire possession of the same thing at the same time nor could one so enjoy his property as to debar another from the use of his who has an equal right so much as to the debitum petendi and as to the debitum reddendi nemo tenetur ad impossible  therefore the lords with great wisdom dissolved both marriages as proceeding upon a natural as well as legal absurdity  chap xvi of the secession of martinus and some hints of his travels this affair being thus unhappily terminated and become the whole talk of the town martinus unable to support the affliction as well as to avoid the many disagreeable consequences resolved to quit the kingdom  but we must not here neglect to mention that during the whole course of this process his continual attendance on the courts in his own cause and his invincible curiosity for all that past in the causes of others gave him a wonderful insight into this branch of learning which must be confessed to have been so improved by the moderns as beyond all comparison to exceed the ancients from the day his first bill was filed he began to collect reports and before his suit was ended he had time abundantly sufficient to compile a very considerable volume his anger at his ill success caused him to destroy the greatest part of these reports and only to preserve such as discovered most of the chicanery and futility of the practice these we have some hopes to recover if they were only mislaid at his removal if not the world will be enough instructed to lament the loss by the only one now public viz the case of stradling and styles in an action concerning certain black and white horses  we cannot wonder that he contracted a violent aversion to the law as is evident from a whole chapter of his travels and perhaps his disappointment gave him also a disinclination to the fair sex for whom on some occasions he does not express all the respect and admiration possible this doubtless must be the reason that in no part of his travels we find him beloved by any strange princess nor have we the least account that he ever relapsed into this passion except what is mentioned in the introduction of the spanish ladys phenomenon  it was in the year      that martin set out on his travels thou will certainly be very curious to know what they were it is not yet time to inform thee but what hints i am at liberty to give i will  thou shall know then that in his first voyage he was carried by a prosperous storm to a discovery of the remains of the ancient pygmaean empire  that in his second he was as happily shipwrecked on the land of the giants now the most humane people in the world  that in his third voyage he discovered a whole kingdom of philosophers who govern by the mathematics with whose admirable schemes and projects he returned to benefit his own dear country but had the misfortune to find them rejected by the envious ministers of queen anne and himself sent treacherously away  and hence it is that in his fourth voyage he discovers a vein of melancholy proceeding almost to a disgust of his species but above all a mortal detestation to the whole flagitious race of ministers and a final resolution not to give in any memorial to the secretary of state in order to subject the lands he discovered to the crown of great britain  now if by these hints the reader can help himself to a further discovery of the nature and contents of these travels he is welcome to as much light as they afford him i am obliged by all the ties of honor not to speak more openly  but if any man shall ever see such very extraordinary voyages into such very extraordinary nations which manifest the most distinguishing marks of a philosopher a politician and a legislator and can imagine them to belong to a surgeon of a ship or a captain of a merchantman let him remain in his ignorance  and whoever he be that shall further observe in every page of such a book that cordial love of mankind that inviolable regard to truth that passion for his dear country and that particular attachment to the excellent princess queen anne surely that man deserves to be pitied if by all those visible signs and characters he cannot distinguish and acknowledge the great scriblerus  chap xvii of the discoveries and works of the great scriblerus made and to be made written and to be written known and unknown and here it seems but natural to lament the unfortunate end of the amor of our philosopher but the historian of these memoirs on the contrary cries out  happy thrice happy day which dissolved the marriage of the great scriblerus let it be celebrated in every language learned and unlearned let the latin the greek the arabian the coptic let all the tongues of manylanguagd men nay of animals be employed to resound it since to this we owe such immense discoveries not only of oceans continents islands with all their inhabitants minute gigantick mortal and immortal but those yet more enlarged and astonishing views of worlds philosophical physical moral intelligible and unintelligible  here therefore at this great period we end our first book and here o reader we entreat thee utterly to forget all thou have hitherto read and to cast thy eyes only forward to that boundless field the next shall open unto thee the fruits of which if thine or our sins do not prevent are to spread and multiply over this our work and over all the face of the earth  in the mean time know what thou owe and what thou yet may owe to this excellent person this prodigy of our age who may well be called the philosopher of ultimate causes since by a sagacity peculiar to himself he has discovered effects in their very cause and without the trivial helps of experiments or observations has been the inventor of most of the modern systems and hypotheses  he has enriched mathematics with many precise and geometrical quadratures of the circle he first discovered the cause of gravity and the intestine motion of fluids  to him we owe all the observations on the parallax of the pole star and all the new theories of the deluge  he it was that first taught the right use sometimes of the fuga vacui and sometimes of the materia subtilis in resolving the grand phenomenon of nature  he it was that first found out the palpability of colors and by the delicacy of his touch could distinguish the different vibrations of the heterogeneous rays of light  his were the projects of perpetuum mobiles flying engines and pacing saddles the method of discovering the longitude by bombvessels and of increasing the tradewind by vast plantations of reeds and sedges  i shall mention only a few of his philosophical and mathematical works   a complete digest of the laws of nature with a review of those that are obsolete or repealed and of those that are ready to be renewed and put in force   a mechanical explication of the formation of the universe according to the epicurean hypothesis   an investigation of the quantity of real matter in the universe with the proportion of the specific gravity of solid matter to that of fluid   microscopical observations of the figure and bulk of the constituent parts of all fluids a calculation of the proportion in which the fluids of the earth decrease and of the period in which they will be totally exhausted   a computation of the duration of the sun and how long it will last before it be burned out   a method to apply the force arising from the immense velocity of light to mechanical purposes   an answer to the question of a curious gentleman how long a new star was lighted up before its appearance to the inhabitants of our earth to which is subjoined a calculation how much the inhabitants of the moon eat for supper considering that they pass a night equal to fifteen of our natural days   a demonstration of the natural dominion of the inhabitants of the earth over those of the moon if ever an intercourse should be opened between them with a proposal of a partitiontreaty among the earthly potentates in case of such discovery   tidetables for a comet that is to approximate toward the earth  0 the number of the inhabitants of london determined by the reports of the goldfinders and the tonnage of their carriages with allowance for the extraordinary quantity of the ingesta and egesta of the people of england and a deduction of what is left under dead walls and dry ditches   it will from hence be evident how much all his studies were directed to the universal benefit of mankind numerous have been his projects to this end of which two alone will be sufficient to show the amazing grandeur of his genius the first was a proposal by a general contribution of all princes to pierce the first crust or nucleus of this our earth quite through to the next concentrical sphere the advantage he proposed from it was to find the parallax of the fixed stars but chiefly to refute sir isaac newtons theory of gravity and mr halleys of the variations the second was to build two poles to the meridian with immense lighthouses on the top of them to supply the defect of nature and to make the longitude as easy to be calculated as the latitude both these he could not but think very practicable by the power of all the potentates of the world  may we presume after these to mention how he descended from the sublime to the beneficial parts of knowledge and particularly his extraordinary practice of physic from the age complexion or weight of the person given he contrived to prescribe at a disance as well as at a patients bedside he taught the way to many modern physicians to cure their patients by intuition and to others to cure without looking on them at all he projected a menstruum to dissolve the stone made of dr woodwards universal delugewater his also was the device to relieve consumptive or asthmatick persons by bringing fresh air out of the country to town by pipes of the nature of the recipients of airpumps and to introduce the native air of a mans country into any other in which he should travel with a seasonable intromission of such steams as were most familiar to him to the inexpressible comfort of many scotsmen laplanders and white bears  in physiognomy his penetration is such that from the picture only of any person he can write his life and from the features of the parents draw the portrait of any child that is to be born  nor has he been so enrapt in these studies as to neglect the polite arts of painting architecture music poetry etc it was he that gave the first hint to our modern painters to improve the likeness of their portraits by the use of such colors as would faithfully and constantly accompany the life not only in its present state but in all its alterations decays age and death itself  in architecture he builds not with so much regard to present symmetry or convenience as with a thought well worthy a true lover of antiquity to wit the noble effect the building will have to posterity when it shall fall and become a ruin  as to music i think heidegger has not the face to deny that he has been much beholden to his scores  in poetry he has appeared under a hundred different names of which we may one day give a catalogue  in politics his writings are of a peculiar cast for the most part ironical and the drift of them often so delicate and refined as to be mistaken by the vulgar he once went so far as to write a persuasive to people to eat their own children which was so little understood as to be taken in ill part he has often written against liberty in the name of freemen and algernoon sydney in vindication of the measures of spain under that of raleigh and in praise of corruption under those of cato and publicola  it is true that at his last departure from england in the reign of queen anne apprehending lest any of these might be
