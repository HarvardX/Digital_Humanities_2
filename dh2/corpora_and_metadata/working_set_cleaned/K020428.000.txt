short sketch of temporary regulations until better shall be proposed for the intended settlement on the grain coast of africa near sierra leona  london printed by h baldwin fleet street m dcc lxxxvi  a short sketch of temporary regulations etc frankpledge the most certain and effectual mode of securing peace right and mutual protection for any community is the old english system of mutual frankpledge or free suretyship given by all the householders for themselves and each other in exact numerical divisions of tens and hundreds which in the english lawbooks is called maxima securitas  the greatest security though it is now unhappily neglected and consequently crimes abound and increase so that notwithstanding the horrible increase also of bloody laws to intimidate offenders yet there is no effectual security from violence and robbery either in our streets or roads or even in our chambers since the houses of the rich and great nay of the first officers of the state are not exempted from the nocturnal intrusion of housebreakers insomuch that even the lord chancellor and honorable speaker of the house of commons have lately experienced the common danger and the deplorable want of the ancient maxima securitas that fundamental system of english polity is so little known among us at present that many wellmeaning persons are induced by their fears to wish for security on a much less eligible plan formed on the model of the arbitrary system of government in france commonly called police the introduction of which would be an utter perversion of the first principles of legal government in england the inhabitants even of the most distant settlements under the crown of great britain must not adopt any polity that is essentially inconsistent with the maxima securitas ordained and required by the common law of england  the community of free african settlers however have already adopted as i am informed a small variation from the old english model of numerical divisions by forming themselves into divisions of dozens instead of tithings or tens but as this little change is by no means inconsistent with the true principles and intention of our legal english frankpledge i am at liberty to acknowledge a most hearty approbation of it as being an arrangement far more convenient and effectual for securing perfect subordination peace and good government even than the ancient legal divisions into tens or decenaries because each dozen will have one chief or headborough and one assistant headborough to govern and lead a complete complement of ten deciners so that the division may still with propriety retain the old legal name of a tithing or decenary and the hundred division may be rendered literally and strictly an hundred families by appointing one hundreder two chiefs of fifties and one town clerk or clerk of the hundred over every eight dozens whereby the legal hundred in its civil capacity for the maintenance of peace justice and common right according to the first principles of our constitutional polity the most effectual for all the purposes of good government will consist of    hundreder or centurion who in the common law is a high constable and justiciarius or justice of the peace     chiefs of fifties  superior constables and presiding justices in the weekly tithingcourts or rather in the courts or four tithings or dozens collected together    town clerk or clerk of the hundred with a proper salary to register all judgments and debts and to be allowed two or more assistants if necessary from the best qualified of the deciners with suitable salaries also for their trouble    headboroughs being constables in ordinary   assistant headboroughs or constables extraordinary  0 deciners  masters of families or householders who jointly with the chiefs of their several divisions pledge each other and their respective families or dependants for the public peace and common right and are termed in law boni et legales homines good and true men  viz  00 householders in all who must equally contribute to support all the burdens of the state and of course must be entitled to an equal voice in the common council or parliament of their settlement which on the african coast is called palaaver and if the whole body of householders should hereafter by gods blessing become too numerous for a personal attendance in their common council they will be all equally entitled to elect a proper number of deputies from their respective divisions to represent them in the supreme council and that in a due and equal proportion to their numbers for otherwise their representation would be rendered most banefully delusive and corrupt   and in a military capacity the same hundred householders will form a corpse of militia consisting of   captain   lieutenants   muster master and commissary   sergeants   corporals  0 milites or men of arms   amounting altogether to  00 free militia men or armed deciners  to these must also be added the sons apprentices and indentured servants of the deciners viz all the males of    years of age and upwards who by the common law are required to be armed and of course to be disciplined in the use of arms the average of males above    years of age may be stated i believe at three to each family including all the persons above described so that in a few years if the settlement succeeds there may probably be added to the  00 armed deciners at least  00 privates or rank and file  in all  00 militia men in each hundred division a corpse that may be rendered sufficiently effectual to support the executive justice of a free legal government within any extent of land which an hundred families can fairly occupy and amply sufficient to supply a roster or rotation of very easy service in the necessary watch and ward of the settlement  n b this average number of males would be rather too large were not apprentices and indentured servants included but in a new settlement where ordinary labor is chiefly wanted there is a great probability that the indentured servants will far exceed the number i have estimated  watch and ward rotation  exercise  discipline preserved by fines of labor  watch duty of indentured servants to be allowed and deducted from the term of their indentures  the hundred deciners should serve three at a time at least with six privates in due rotation as the nightly guard of the hundred division which guard being divided into three parties of one deciner and two privates each one party may patrole whilst the other two are stationed at the gate house or watchtower alternately watching and resting every four hours but the patroling and watching party must relieve each other every two hours until it is their turn to rest four hours in the inner guard room by this means the watch duty may be rendered very easy and equal to all ranks of persons in the hundred and even if the captain and four of the oldest deciners together with eight of the youngest privates be excused the nightly duty the rotation of this easy service to each individual will be only once in thirtytwo nights viz less than twelve nights in a year which cannot interfere with their ordinary employments but for the sake of keeping up proper discipline triple the number ought to assemble in rotation every evening and morning to set and to discharge the guard after the performance of a short military exercise all together under the inspection of the captain or one of the lieutenants being previously trained or drilled in small squads under the inspection of their respective sergeants and this attendance may be rendered perfectly equal and regular to all ranks by a proper roster of service duly distinguishing the courses of watch and ward from the rotation of attendance for mere exercise  want of punctuality in musters or absence should be punished in proportion to the time lost by equal fines on all ranks of men estimated at so many days or hours labor as hereafter explained toward the support of the public exchequer  disobedience of orders on service and inattention or carelessness in exercise and all such other misdemeanors should be likewise punished by fines of labor for public profit  the watch duty of an indentured servant should be rewarded by a deduction of one days service from his indentures for each night that he attends on military duty which will encourage his vigilance and win his attention to the interests of the settlement and by his being entered on the same roster with the whole body of deciners and by serving in due rotation with them he will soon perceive the facility and happiness of becoming a deciner himself by proper diligence in fulfilling his contract of labor especially as the regulations hereafter to be mentioned will insure him from the imposition of more service than is due and from the fraud or oppression of an unjust master and he will acquire still further security by being known and by becoming acquainted with other deciners besides his master in the militia service  free labor free labor to be the standard or medium of traffic instead of cash  times of labor public or hired to be general and uniform  evening prayer and the advantages of it  limitation of labor per day to eight hours  six hours on saturdays  that the people may attend the courts and folkmotes to improve their decernment of good and evil  human labor is more essential and valuable than any other article in new settlements which chiefly depend on the cultivation and produce of the earth for their subsistence and commercial profit on this account though the price of provisions is generally lower in new settlements than in communities of long standing yet the price of free labor is always much higher and higher still or rather infinitely more expensive however slaveholders may reckon is the labor of slaves besides the abominable injustice the corruption of manners the danger and other curses which always attend the toleration of slavery free labor therefore in all new settlements ought to be made the standard or medium whereby to rate the value of all the necessaries of life as well as of all articles of commerce in the settlement a cow sheep or hog or a bushel of corn should each be valued at a proportionable number of days labor estimated at eight hours actual labor per day and a pig rabbit or fowl at so many hours labor according to their respective sizes and for the fractional estimation of smaller articles the hours may be reduced to minutes and thereby afford an excellent substitute for money as a medium of traffic and exchange whereon a paper currency may be established which will always bear an intrinsic value without diminution as hereafter explained under the head of public revenue  the daily commencement of public labor and of hired labor and all the necessary cessations from labor for rest and refreshment should be limited to stated periods of time rendered uniform and general throughout the settlement by the periodical summons of a public bell as in our dock yards and great manufactories for the more effectual prevention of imposition by the employer or employed  by the limitation of labor to eight hours per day the rateable or legal days work instead of continuing from six in the morning to six in the evening as with us will end at four in the afternoon including two whole hours for necessary refreshment and rest unless it should be thought more convenient in general to begin at five in the morning and to work three hours till eight and then after resting half an hour at breakfast to work three hours and an half more till noon when a moderate and temperate meal suitable to the heat of the climate may be rendered more refreshing and healthful to the labourer by a general sestoo or sleeping time during the meridean heat till half past one which rest of one hour and an half at one time will be amply sufficient to recruit them for the remaining burden of the rateable labor or legal days work viz one hour and an half more ending at three oclock in the afternoon when the evening of the ancients commenced and the appointed hour of evening sacrifice in the patriarchal times if therefore the new society would agree to assemble at that hour in whatever place they shall afterward appropriate to religious worship and there join together in a very short general form of prayer and evening sacrifice of thanks in which to remove all objections about the value of time they need not be detained much longer than about five minutes to express all that may be absolutely necessary for every good purpose of prayer and thanksgiving at least as a daily service they will soon be convinced that no human measure is so well calculated to add real dignity to the ordinary labourer as well with respect to his own internal improvement as in the outward esteem and consideration which it will necessarily insure to him from others by continually reminding the rich and higher ranks of men that the daily labourer is their brother and their equal in the sight of god and that all men ought to be equally servants to the same lord i could wish that a short daily morning prayer might also be adopted at nine oclock after breakfast but i propose with diffidence lest public prayers even only once a day should be obtained with difficulty  as some of the out lots will be distant about two miles from the center of the township it may perhaps be more expedient to commence the rateable daily labor even half an hour sooner still than i have last proposed viz at half past four in the cool of the morning whereby all public labor will end at half past two in the afternoon which will allow time for laborers in the distant lots to repair to the general assembly of the township at evening prayer and an officer from every dozen may be ordered to be prepared by a previous examination at the public bank of all the indents in course for each days labor that after being discharged in the public books they may be cancelled and most expeditiously returned to those who have fulfilled them all which by the happy system of frankpledge may be most easily effected with very little loss of time so that the laborers may return from the center of the township to their own private lots and have near five hours of leisure to themselves to cultivate their own land even if they work no later than eight at night which will allow them ample time for rest especially as the midday sestoo will render less sleep necessary at night  a seventh part of the year shall be appropriated more particularly to gods service and shall be duly observed and kept holy on the penalty of seven weeks or fortytwo days labor in the public lots for every breach of this universal law of god either in buying selling or working for pecuniary profit or for traveling unless a very urgent necessity can be proved and this penalty to be doubled on a repetition or continuance of the offense    sundays or days of our lord  two more days shall be appropriated to a religious commemoration of our lords birth and expiatory death at the usual seasons and a third day to the great annual view of frankpledge to be appointed at some convenient season after the greatest and most general harvest of the year the remembrance of which shall also be solemnized on that day by religious thanksgiving both at the opening and conclusion of the view of frankpledge  so that the     days of the year will be further reduced by the deduction also of   holidays  the abovementioned sundays and holidays amounting to fiftyfive days being deducted from the year there will remain only   0 days of labor       the days of labor shall be rated throughout the new settlement only at eight hours actual labor each day in all agreements or contracts for labor as well of apprentices and indentured servants as of those who are hired by the day that all laborers may have some leisure hours every day to cultivate their own private lots of land and only six hours labor are to be required by law on saturdays without any deduction from the labourers profit for the deficiency because it is for the public benefit that the people should have leisure to attend the courts and folkmotes to be held on saturdays in order that they may gradually improve that natural faculty of reason or knowledge which is inherited by all men from our first parents and may have their understandings exercised by habit to discern both good and evil  freedom and protection to strangers limitation of indentured service  an injured indentured servant to be turned over to the public exchequer  fugitive slaves to be protected and allowed to purchase land by labor and after due time of probation to be admitted to the rank of deciners  as soon as a slave shall set his foot within the bounds of the new settlement he shall be deemed a free man and be equally entitled with the rest of the inhabitants to the protection of the laws and to all the natural rights of humanity and the service even of indentured servants shall be strictly limited viz no person to be bound for a longer term than five years after the age of twentyone or of seven years if bound after the age of fourteen years or of ten years if bound after the age of eleven years and if any indentured servant shall have just cause to complain of his masters behavior to him he shall be turned over to the care of the general asylum for males and his labor for the limited term of his indentures shall be turned over to the public exchequer which shall purchase of the master all the remaining term of service if any slave shall escape from his master in any part of the neighboring country where the abominable traffic in human beings is tolerated and shall apply at any township within the free settlements for an asylum he shall be received and protected in the public asylum for this is required by an indispensable moral law of god and of course by the laws of england  thou shall not deliver unto his master the servant or slave for all slaves are servants which is escaped from his master unto thee he shall dwell with thee even among you in that place which he shall choose in one of thy gates where it likes him best thou shall not oppress him deuteronomy xxiii       the stranger however shall be required to promise obedience to the laws of the settlement and due legal submission to the chiefs of the division wherein he is admitted and pledged and also to enter himself on the public roster of equal service in watch and ward when of proper age and in order to obtain his livelihood independently of individuals he shall if he is above twenty years of age be allowed to purchase of the public exchequer one quarter of a lot of land for one years service consisting of   0 days service of eight hours each and a proportionable addition to the term if under that age for which quarter of a lot he shall be taxed only one quarter part of a deciners contribution to parochial and public exigences and expenses which proportionable contribution of labor for taxes shall commence from the time he receives the land but the exchequer shall give him credit for the labor of purchase until the second year after he receives the land in the course of which only half of the labor viz     days may be demanded and the remainder in the course of the third year whereby the stranger will have spare days of labor to enable him by giving indents for it to purchase necessaries for his farm and he shall be allowed a separate chamber in the public asylum or inn until he is able to build an house or cottage upon his own lot after he has faithfully discharged his debt of service according to his first contract with the exchequer and also his other contract debts with private individuals for all such private debts should be entered in the public exchequer in order to give intrinsic value to the indentures for labor as the state of every mans credit and circumstances will then appear on the public books he shall be allowed another quarter of a lot on the same terms and so on till he has acquired a complete lot when if he has by his good and faithful behavior proved himself worthy of the rank and trust of a deciner he shall be admitted to all the privileges and civil rights of the community as a free member and equal proprietor of the whole settlement  redemption from slavery redemption from slavery  price to be repaid by a short limited service to the public exchequer  profit by redemption infinitely superior to the profits of the slave trade  though it is a fundamental principle of the settlement that all slaves shall be deemed free as soon as they enter it so that no person can retain or sell or employ a slave within the bounds of the settlement yet there can be no impropriety in providing a means of repaying the expense of redeeming slaves on the condition of a short limited service as an apprentice or indentured servant provided that the actual prices given for redemption can be sufficiently authenticated that no more may be repaid except perhaps a limited profit not exceeding ten per cent by way of interest for advancing the price and provided also that the said limited service of the contract be not claimable by any individual but by the public exchequer only after the redeemed person has consented to work out the price whereby all possibility of domestic slavery or private oppression will be excluded and the exchequer will give an ample equivalent to the redeemed person to insure his voluntary consent to a contract for a limited time of labor not only by the protection it will afford him but also by putting him in possession of a portion of land equal to the quarter part of a deciners lot to be increased as he discharges his debt of labor and by finding him provisions until he shall be able to raise provisions from his own land the public exchequer will be enabled by the consent of a majority of the settlers thus to dispose of land because all the unoccupied land in the settlement is to be deemed as common in which the whole body of settlers sent out from england if above sixteen years of age whether indentured or not shall be entitled to an equal share and therefore no land must be appropriated but by common consent suppose the redemption of a man should cost ten pounds which i believe is about the average price on the coast and suppose the labor of such a stranger be estimated only at sixpence sterling per day though it is certainly worth much more perhaps three or four times as much a limited service by the redeemed person of five years to the public exchequer as an equivalent for the purchase of a full lot of protected land with a gradual introduction to all the privileges of a free english settlement will amount at   0 working days per annum fiftytwo sundays and three holidays being deducted for the reasons already mentioned under the head of free labor will amount i say to   l   s out of which after paying  0l the price of redemption and  0 per cent for the advance of money viz  l more there will remain in the public exchequer toward supplying food and necessaries to the labourer till he can provide for himself and for risque of loss by sickness or death the sum of   l   s the surplus of which if the redeemed person lives and does well becomes the property of the public in which he himself enjoys an equal share of profit so that the purchase of a slave under so equitable a regulation will be really and truly a redemption from slavery to a state of freedom and protection and if the voluntary labor of a man should really be worth three times what i have estimated as i really believe it is the profit for redemption for   l disbursed will amount to  0 l  s which is        l per cent in favor of the public exchequer nay the profit may be fairly estimated at a much higher rate for if the free labor which the redeemed person pays for his lot of land be employed by the elected trustees of the exchequer in the public lots of land they may expect to receive at least the ordinary production of land for the labor bestowed upon it which even in our northern climate may be rated at a triple amount and much more may certainly be expected in the fertile and productive climate of africa so that the ordinary profit may fairly be stated at    l   s for   l disbursed which is at the rate of    0    l per cent in favor of the public exchequer in which the redeemed person himself would have an equal property with the rest of the community let the advocates for slavery show if they can that involuntary servitude is equally profitable the intolerable expense of all kinds of labor wherever slavery is permitted when compared with the price of labor in free countries will sufficiently confute them but more shall be said of the great profits of free labor under the head of public revenue etc  agrarian law money for purchasing land to be invested in presents for the african chiefs  chiefs to be previously acquainted with some necessary conditions  all the settlers to be restrained from purchasing land for private property until the bargains for the public land are concluded  the presents to be deemed public stock  all the settlers above sixteen years of age to be equally entitled to the land  precautions for fixing on the spot for the first township  settlers to be obedient to the agent and how long  reserve of land  limitation of land  limitation of landed possession  manner of laying out a tenth lot for the conductor  also two more lots for public uses  likewise ten other public lots for every hundred private lots  how to be appropriated general asylum for males and females and for married persons  hospital for sick  penitentiary let  glebe land  no layman to have benefit from the glebe  limitation of the cure of souls  lot for parish clerks and beadles  under beadles or trumpeters  lot for a town clerk  let for two assistant clerks of the hundred  one reserved lot to make good deficiencies  allowance of land to apprentices and indentured servants  sons of settlers how to purchase land  indentured servants allowed to redeem the terms of service and how  and to purchase land by labor  the money which has been paid into the hands of the trustees to procure land for the settlement shall be vested in such articles of merchandise as are deemed most proper for presents to the petty chiefs or cabosieurs on the african coast and shall be disposed of among them to the best advantage to engage their peaceable consent to admit the new settlers and to give up to them a sufficient tract of uninhabited land bordering on the sea or on some navigable river or creek where fresh water also may be procured with every other natural accommodation suitable and necessary for a proper settlement but in treating for the land the cabosieurs or chiefs shall be informed as a necessary part of the agreement that the land which they are requested to give up to the new setlers is intended to be dignified with the title and privileges of a land of freedom like england where no man can be a slave for as soon as a slave sets foot on english ground he immediately becomes free provided he conforms himself to the laws of the state and therefore if any slave who has escaped from his master in the neighboring country where slavery is allowed should fairly get within the boundary of the new settlement he is afterward to be considered as a free man and no man must pursue him to take him away by force nor be offended with the new settlers for refusing to deliver him up because they are indispensably required by the laws of god and of england to protect the slave that has escaped from his master see this further explained under the head of freedom this previous declaration is absolutely necessary to be made as one means of avoiding future disputes with the neighboring inhabitants and in order that as much land as possible may be procured for the new settlement by the abovementioned presents the agent or agents for the settlers and every individual among them shall be restrained from purchasing or making any agreement whatever for separate private property in land on pain of forfeiting all right to a share in the profits of the settlement until an agreement is made and concluded for the whole common stock of land and until the bounds of it are actually marked out and made known to the whole body of settlers an invoice shall be made of all the articles for presents in which the money intended for the purchase of land was invested so that if any articles remain more than are necessary for the purpose they shall be deemed a part of the common stock and shall be registered accordingly the whole body of original settlers that go together from england above the age of sixteen years whether male or female apprentice or indentured servant shall be equally entitled to all the land within the bounds of the settlement subject however to the rules hereafter expressed for the appropriation of it from time to time when wanted and all unappropriated land shall be deemed common no land shall be appropriated but by the free consent of a majority of the settlers after a full discussion of the reasons in the common council or folkmote  when the agentconductor shall have carefully viewed and considered the tract of country thus vested in the community of settlers he shall recommend to them a proper situation for the first encampment and principal township as nearly in the center of their territory as the necessary accommodations of a constant supply of fresh water and a navigable communication with the sea will permit and he shall lay before the community his reasons for the choice and if any other person or persons should propose different situations of equal propriety the elected heads of dozens or a sufficient deputation from them must carefully examine all the proposed situations and after duly weighing the reasons assigned for each proposal they shall make their report to the common council and the opinion of the majority shall decide the question for it is absolutely necessary that the majority of the settlers should be well satisfied and contented with the situation of their principal township whether it be better or worse than was first proposed but in all other points they must be obedient to the advice of the agentconductor and follow his directions in clearing the ground marking out and entrenching the first encampment building temporary barracks and storehouses for the accommodation of the whole community and in digging sowing and planting in the public grounds for the common support of the whole body of settlers and no man shall separate himself to work for private emolument until a small portion of land for a town lot and a larger portion for an out lot agreeable to a plan annexed no   shall be marked out and sufficiently cleared by public labor for every settler nor until the said portions of land are equally and indifferently appropriated to each person by lot to avoid disputes and shall be duly registered with the names of the respective proprietors whether or not the separate private houses should be built by joint and public labor may be afterward discussed and determined in the common council land shall be reserved in the township for such new settlers as may afterward arrive which may in the mean time be cultivatad for public benefit but it shall not be appropriated until it is really wanted for such additional settlers as may afterward join themselves to the community for no man ought to be the proprietor of more than one town lot with its proportional out lot according to the limitation hereafter mentioned and therefore if any additional land either of town lots or out lots or both should be acquired by marriage or by inheritance or legacy or by any other lawful means the inheritor shall be allowed three years to dispose of them but in any other case if it should be found out that one individual possesses more than one town lot or more land in out lots than is declared in the following table such land and lots shall be forfeited to the community  exception n b the agent or first conductor of the settlement is excepted in the above regulation because he is to be allowed every tenth lot that is laid out for private property on account of his extraordinary care and trouble in agreeing for the land and for laying out the lots memorandum mr smeathman the agent and first proposer of the settlement having unfortunately caught a putrid fever of which he died july        the gentlemen of the committee must now determine whether this exception ought to be made in favor of any other agent or whether this tenth lot ought not rather to be reserved for such public purposes as the committee may hereafter think proper to direct as more money than what is allowed by government will probably be wanted the reserved tenth lots may enable the settlers to repay whatever money may be necessary for them to borrow for the first exigencies of their little community  and also such public officers are to be excepted who hold public lots hereafter mentioned in right of their respective offices as the chaplain clerk of the hundred two assistant clerks of the hundred and the three beadles each of whom may be allowed to possess one separate lot in their private capacity besides their official public lots  if any man should be dissatisfied with the situation of the first township and can find eleven other deciners of the same opinion they may afterward dispose of their registered lots and agree with the community to whom all the unoccupied land within the bounds of the settlement does jointly and equally belong for sufficient land to form a proportional township in some distant part as proposed in the general scheme of the settlement plate no   according to the following limitation  limitation of landed possessions no person shall possess in his or her own right more land exclusive of the town lot where the person dwells than the number of acres expressed against the following descriptions of places viz within   miles of the principal town not more than  0 acres within   miles of the sea navigable river creek or haven in any other part of the settlement not more than  0 acres within   miles of do not more than  00 acres within    miles of do not more than  00 acres   whenever nine lots are laid out a tenth of equal size shall be laid out closely adjoining to them which shall be numbered and registered as the property of the conductor or for a reserve to pay public debts the first conductor to whom the promise of every tenth lot was made having lately died the committee are at liberty to dispose of this reserved land as they shall think most just and right and an account shall be kept of whatever odd number of lots are laid out at the same time more than the ten last appropriated and less than the amount of another nine that as other new lots are demanded the conductor may have a tenth lot of equal size close adjoining to any of the last appropriated lots which he shall choose but for every ten lots thus marked out for private property two lots of equal size shall be also marked out adjoining to them for public uses to be registered as such which under the care of an elected committee in every district controlled by the common council of the state shall be cultivated by public labor hereafter more fully explained and the produce be appropriated to a public fund for religious instruction schools poor hospitals salaries of public officers and all such just and reasonable expenses besides as ought to be defrayed by a public exchequer and also to every hundred lots laid out for private property ten additional public lots n b the public lots are not to be reckoned with those that are tithed in favor of the conductor but only the lots which are laid up for private property shall be laid out closely adjoining viz one lot for a general asylum for poor males under the care and direction of the oldest and most prudent deciners in the hundred elected as a committee expressly for that trust  secondly one lot for a general asylum of poor females under the care of the elderly widows or of such other prudent matrons as shall be elected to the charge  thirdly one lot for a general asylum of poor families of both sexes together that the branches of a family may not be separated through misfortunes or poverty but that each family may be allowed a distinct and separate habitation to themselves at the public expense until they can be otherwise provided and more comfortably established under the care and patronage of the committee of elder deciners above mentioned spare chambers shall also be prepared to accommodate strangers and travelers as at an inn but separately in the said three lots according to their respective descriptions of male female or family  fourthly one lot for the support of an hospital for the sick and hurt divided into separate wards for males and females subject respectively to the visitation and direction of the two separate trusts abovementioned  and fifthly one penitentiary lot to be strongly fenced with palisades ditch and parapet having all the defenses reversed or facing inwards for the secure confinement of all felonious offenders and to be divided into three distinct compartments two for the separation of the two sexes and a third for the married persons of either sex that they may not be separated from their spouses or families in case they should desire to attend them and  sixthly one lot to be registered as glebe land and to be reserved for the chaplain of the hundred whenever a clergyman duly qualisied shall be elected by the majority of the deciners or householders in the hundred but no layman during the vacancy may receive any profit from the glebe though he may officiate gratis as far as a layman may lawfully be allowed to interfere in the sacred office and no chaplain shall be inducted to a legal charge or cure of souls over more than one hundred families of deciners and their dependants at one time with due exception however to clergymen of episcopal authority in case gods blessing on the settlement should hereafter render the appointment of bishops necessary  seventhly one lot half of which to be appropriated to the use of a parish clerk who shall also act as a head beadle in all assemblies of the hundred and the other half in equal parts to two inferior beadles for his assistants who as soon as they can be taught shall have an additional salary as trumpeters to summon the people to the courts of justice and to assemble the militia at the head quarters in case of public danger  eighthly one lot for a town clerk or recorder of the hundred who shall keep an exact register of all the appropriations of land in his division the rosters of service both civil and military the judgments of the courts for fines of labor and the due registering of all private contracts for labor in which duty he shall be subject to the control and account of the public exchequer in the principal township  ninthly one lot for two assistant clerks of the hundred to be elected from the body of deciners the most prudent and best qualified to acquire a general knowledge of the principles and maxims of the common law as well as of the regulations of the settlement that they may be able to advise the headboroughs on all occasions and  tenthly one public lot reserved to make good the deficiencies of any of the rest or to be applied to any other public use that the hundred court shall think proper to direct and if any of these public lots or any parts thereof remain uncultivated the directors of the nearest bank with the consent of the hundred court may cause the superfluous land to be cleared and cultivated for the increase of the public stock and revenue  every apprentice or indentured male above the age of sixteen years that shall afterward be introduced into the settlement from europe and every male bred in the settlement as they arrive at that age shall be allowed by the public as many acres of land to himself adjoining to the out lot of his parent or of his master as will amount to an eighth part of a lot in order that he may employ his leisure hours to his own profit and as soon as he is twentyone years of age he shall have an addition from the public of oneeighth more amounting in all to one quarter of a lot gratis and the son of a settler when arrived at that age shall be allowed to purchase threefourths of a lot more to complete his proportion for a deciner at the rate of half a years service for each fourth part  that is in all for

nor even an apprentice or indentured servant if bound for a longer term than what is limited under the general head of freedom shall be permitted to work within the bounds of the settlement lest any discredit should thereby be thrown on honest labor and for the same reason the fines of days work laid on persons convicted of felony within the settlement shall not be entered on the same books of

above the age of eighteen years and shall be estimated at the value only of ordinary labor in cultivating the earth amounting for each person per annum to sixtytwo days of ordinary labor    days  for

form a rateable medium for the prices of all kinds of small articles in traffic and to afford a convenient exchange when the indentures are circulated like bills in lieu of cash and for such articles as may require a still smaller fraction to express any gradual rising or fall of price the proper fraction of an hour into sixty minutes will be sufficiently small for all purposes and if any species of so small a value as one minute or even as five or fifteen minutes should be thought necessary small pieces of copper or other cheap metals amber or particular kinds of shells or beads may be substituted for it but if indentures for the sake of uniformity in the currency should be preferred an indenture for ten minutes the sixth part of an hour will amount exactly to one farthing at the lowest price of ordinary labor i e one shilling per day  in the indentures must be expressed the name of the township or of the hundred and the number or other denomination of the tithing or dozen wherein the signer lives and when the indenture is cut at the figured tally the signer of it shall keep the checque in his own possession but shall deliver the full number and value of his signed indentures into the exchequer in the presence of the chief of the dozen to which he belongs if he himself is an headborough or chief of a dozen he shall deliver his indentures in the presence of his hundreder or of three other headboroughs of the same hundred and the hundreder himself in the presence of four headboroughs of his own division  the entry or counter checque in the public treasury of every mans account of indentures for which he is a debtor to the public shall be carefully examined and certified by the hundreders or their assistants or at least by four of the headboroughs of the particular division to which each debtor respectively belongs which will be very little trouble to each chief as the highest will certify only for  00 families and the regularity of the frankpledge and the certain knowledge of each individual in a division which every chief obtains by it will effectually secure every individual from forgeries so that no man will be liable to answer any demands for labor but what may be amply proved and authenticated by comparing the checques in his own hands with the certified entry in the exchequer  masters of apprentices and also of indentured strangers brought by them into the settlement shall be obliged to register the said indentured persons in the public exchequer of the township where he lives together with the terms of their indentures on the penalty of   0 days labor for every wilful failure herein and he shall be obliged to deduct from the limited time of indentured service all the time that the apprentices or servants have worked for the public benefit  when a man has worked out or otherwise redeemed any of the papermoney for which he is nominally responsible and shall have received back the indenture after the service he may produce it at the exchequer together with its corresponding checque that it may be cancelled in the public account whereby the discharge of public debts may be as regularly proved and authenticated as the just demands abovementioned and the state of a mans public debt may always be known at the public exchequer by the balance of indentures in his account and thereby all frauds and impositions may be easily traced and detected  as labor in all new settlements where land is cheap is of course much higher and more valuable than in old established states the intrinsic value of the labor in the proposed new settlement might fairly be estimated at double the price of labor in england but at present i will rate it only at one shilling per day on account of the limitation of eight hours instead of ten commonly required in england about  00 males have already entered their names which number multiplied by sixtytwo the tax of days work due from each per annum by this regulation will produce    00 days of labor in a year due to the public which estimated at the low average rate of only  s per day will amount to   0l per annum and as the value or expense of labor when applied to land at the ordinary estimation of increase by the products of the earth in return for labor and care is expected to produce at least triple the amount of the disbursement even in our northern climates so the value of   0l bestowed in labor on the public lots of land in the fertile and productive climate of africa where very little labor is necessary might certainly be estimated much higher but even at the ordinary rate it will amount to    0l per annum which is a very great public revenue if it be remembered that it is calculated on the very small number of  00 males reckoning rich and poor together which are only the ordinary average number of males in an hundred division or  00 families of a well established settlement at the rate of three males to a family  the general contribution which i have proposed is equally laid on the poor as on the rich the former being equally capable of paying it and that certainly with more ease to themselves by being accustomed to ordinary labor nevertheless the rich it may be said ought to contribute more than the poor on account of the superior advantages which accrue to them by their association with the poor in one well regulated political body the superior advantages i speak of are   st the personal ease or exemption from labor which their riches may always procure to them in such a society  and secondly the effectual security of their property or wealth procured in frankpledge or maxima securitas by the equal exertion of persons who have no property and by an equal risque also of their lives in case of actual danger so that it seems clearly reasonable and just that the rich and higher ranks of citizens should contribute more to the public revenue than the poor  but in what proportion is rather difficult to determine though it may be readily answered that the quantity of riches should in due proportion determine the quantity of contribution yet this cannot be done without a general tax on property which as experience teaches us is liable to many inconveniences so that even the ancient and ordinary tax of tithes to the clergy is deemed grievously inconvenient on account of the difficulties disputes quarrels and vexations which too frequently happen as well in compounding for them as in the collection of them in kind the only expedient therefore which i am able to devise at present for procuring a larger contribution from the rich is a tax on pride and indolence a tax which though it will not produce in exact proportion to the property of the wealthy will nevertheless most certainly obtain from the wealthy and luxurious a contribution exactly proportionate to whatever pride and indolence may be occasioned by the superfluous wealth of the community and in aid to this tax on superfluous wealth the affluence likewise of the more useful members of society whose employments procure them a more profitable reward than they could obtain by ordinary labor might be made to yield a reasonable addition to the revenue in consideration of their superior abilities to contribute which men of this respectable class certainly have  tax on pride and indolence and on persons who have superior emoluments above the ordinary class of laborers though labor is the common lot of man according to the divine sentence or penal judgment denounced against our first male parent  in the sweat of thy face shall thou eat bread till thou return into the ground etc genesis iii    and though an apostle also has declared that if any would not work neither should he eat yet many persons there are in every community who by some means or other seem to be exempted from the necessity of personal labor the ordinary condition of human life how this may be accounted for and reconciled with the divine decree is stated more at large in my tract on the law of nature and principles of action in man p      0 nothing therefore according to natural religion can be more reasonable and just or more consistent also according to the second foundation of law with the revealed will of god in the holy scriptures than that all persons who have wealth sufficient to purchase an exemption from this ordinary lot of man should be required to contribute in a larger proportion to the exigencies of the community than persons who depend on their daily labor for their daily bread and this additional contribution may very easily be levied without making any other additional object of taxation than what i have already proposed to be the single article of general contribution viz the two tenths of ordinary labor let a redemption of the general tax of sixtytwo days contribution viz two tenths of ordinary labor be required at the rate of a double or if necessary of a triple value of the service from all persons who having no real bodily infirmity or incapacity shall decline a personal attendance for the general contribution either through pride by setting themselves up above their brethren in their own estimation as superior to the common lot of ordinary labor or else by having a better and more reasonable motive that of a more profitable occupation for the employment of their time which will equally render them capable of paying without any actual hardship the additional tax for the ease indulgence and superior profit which they enjoy by the purchase  suppose there be ten men in an hundred or thirty males in one hundred families whose pride or wealth or indolence would induce them to decline personal labor such men ought surely to redeem their exemption at a triple value which cannot amount to any real hardship or oppression as the alternative and only hardship to those who may love too well their wealth and deem the tax too heavy is to submit to the ordinary lot of their brethren in complying with a short limited service for the public benefit in which they themselves have an equal profit and suppose there be also double that number of persons in an hundred division who have useful arts and more profitable trades and occupations to induce their redemption of personal service  the produce of the tax will be as follows  the first class of thirty gentlemen or idle men taxed at triple the value of the sixtytwo days of ordinary labor will pay all together the sum of    l but as the sixtytwo days of labor from each is already included in the former general calculation one third must be deducted from the estimated value of this additional tax where by it is reduced to l s d     0 0 the second class of  0 merchants tradesman or useful artificers who will be induced by more profitable occupations to redeem their personal labor will each pay a double tax viz the value of     days ordinary labor at  s per day which all together is only   l   s per ann each man but as they are already charged half that sum in the general estimate of contribution the other half alone must here be reckoned viz  l  s which multiplied by  0 amounts to     0 0 total additional tax on the   classes abovementioned in one hundred families     0 0 which addition if laid out on the cultivation of land in the public lots would produce three times that value according to the ordinary increase of land for the labor bestowed on it the risque indeed of a misapplication of the labor or of a defalcation of the increase may reasonably be objected according to the ordinary misconduct of persons entrusted with the care of farms at present in this country but the same objection will not hold where frankpledge is duly established because the eye of every neighbor would be a watchful guard against fraud all being equally interested in the public profit i will therefore multiply this additional tax by   the ordinary rate of increase to be expected from the land which is cultivated by it   0 0      0 0 to which add the general contribution before estimated at    0 0 0 the total amount of revenue for one single division of an hundred families   0  0 0  thus an ample source is opened not only of public credit but also of private security or trust in traffic by the same easy means whereby poor laboring men may be enabled to obtain all the necessary articles of merchandise though they have no ready money to advance for as ordinary labor is rendered the medium of traffic instead of cash the first advantage to a poor industrious man accustomed only to ordinary labor is that he will at all times have it in his power to obtain employment in the search of which with us many honest men in all the three kingdoms are obliged to leave their native country and the second material advantage to him is that he can always obtain an immediate credit proportionable to the value of his unengaged time for any articles of trade that he may want by giving the merchant or tradesman in return for them an indenture for as many days labor as the purchase is worth and he is also enabled to employ a blacksmith carpenter or other useful artificer in case he should want their assistance on his own lot by giving them in like manner an indenture for as many days of ordinary labor as will amount to the value of the work these indentures as before proposed for the indentures of general contribution should express the names of the hundred and of the dozen in which the signer is associated and should be previously carried by him to be entered at the public exchequer or bank of the hundred and be there properly certified as before proposed after which the labourer may cut off the indentures from his checques at the printed tally and pay them to the merchant or tradesman for the article purchased or to the artificer for his job retaining the checques in his own custody that he may always know the amount of his debt of labor on the other hand the merchant tradesman or artificer who receives such an indenture from a poor labourer can immediately realize the value of it in his own favor by paying it into the public exchequer or bank of the township where of course it will be posted to the credit of his account of labor and will enable him to redeem a part of his own indentures without his own personal labor which of course is much more valuable than ordinary labor and in like manner he will proceed with all other indentures for ordinary labor that he has procured by his traffic or more valuable occupation always paying them to the credit of his account at the bank until the amount exceeds his own debt for public service when from the balance of labor in his favor according to the amount of it he will always be at liberty to draw on the bank for indentures of days work either for circulation as ready cash or for laborers to cultivate his own lot of land or else occasionally to accommodate planters who want laborers and are willing to pay the value of them in produce etc whereby private credit as well as public credit already provided for will be amply supported and the indentures for labor by which this most essential public and private service is effected will be in fact a paper currency of intrinsic value answering all the purposes of ready cash as a medium of traffic as well as all the necessary purposes of negociable bills to support public and private credit and yet they cannot be at all liable to depreciation  the advantages appear to me so great and extraordinary that i can hardly give credit as i proceed to my own estimation of them and am inclined to suspect that i am in some way or other enormously mistaken but as i cannot yet find out my error i must leave my censure to some more able head a few obvious objections however i am prepared to remove by a timely proposal of adequate remedies as for instance  whatever might be deemed troublesome or disagreeable in exacting the payment of these debts of labor may be effectually withdrawn from individuals by investing the public bank of each township with the sole authority of demanding the labor for the indentures that have been respectively entered and certified therein and that the several banks may be enabled to realize the value of these indentures all applications either for laborers or labor shall be made at the several town banks where planters may be sure of a supply of laborers and the labourer equally sure of a constant supply of work without danger of oppression or non payment of wages being secured from both by the mediation of the bank which employs him and disposes of his service and both parties or at least the planters ought to pay some small allowance per cent to the bank by way of commission or profit for the negotiation and each bank should regularly summon with due previous notice for every day a sufficient number of the indentured laborers that are entered on their books not only to cultivate the public lots of land under their care but also to supply the current daily demand of labor that may be wanted by planters and other private individuals but all persons summoned to labor shall work on the public lots until such demands are made by which means the laborers will lose no time in waiting for work the daily summonses to labor issued from the bank should be made in due rotation according to the dates of the indentures entered on the books and according to the quantity of debt which each individual has to work out and that no man may run deeper in debt by disposing of his labor to a greater amount than he may be able to discharge in due time all indentures whatsoever for the labor either of apprentices or servants should be entered at the bank of the township where the parties reside whereby not only the state of every labourers debt may be always known and of course likewise his ability to discharge it but also on the other hand the laborers apprentices and servants themselves will be thereby more easily protected from the oppression of such avaritious masters as might otherwise be inclined to exact more service than is due by the terms of their contract  if any person should die before his indentured service is discharged to the public bank his land stock and effects shall be answerable to the amount of his deficiency to the public in preference to all other debts whereby the paper currency will always preserve a standard value and at the same time afford a most convenient medium for traffic and exchange if any further difficulties more than i have foreseen and guarded against should still be objected i flatter myself that the salutary establishment of frankpledge will be sufficient to obviate them all for this maxima securitas renders every individual completely responsible for all debts or demands that can justly be made upon him and for all charges against him whatever because the residence of the meanest member of society can be most expeditiously known by the public books so that he may be immediately traced at any time to his very chamber and no individual in frankpledge can resist the united power of a free people  for if any one should neglect or despise the summons of the public bank his tithing or dozen may be compelled on the penalty of a heavy fine for neglect to produce him and should the tithing or dozen neglect the hundred is summoned to enforce satisfaction and so on with respect to higher divisions until the strength of the whole community is united as one man to render executive justice to fine or otherwise punish all contumacious delinquents against common sense and to enforce obedience to the determined justice of the majority this occasional mention of misdemeanors and fines reminds me that i have omitted to add to the amount of my calculation of revenue the profit of the public fines and forfeitures which must always be very considerable where frankpledge is established not only because the regularity and order of the system renders the levying of fines and forfeitures extremely easy expeditious and free from expense but also because the penalties of fines and forfeitures are in frankpledge extended to the minutest immoralities and negligences in order to render the peace and regularity of society as perfect as possible add to this a very particular advantage which the ancient mode of punishing by fines and forfeitures will acquire by the application of my proposal of universal calculation by days labor  an advantage which could never before be obtained viz that the poorest man has thereby something to forfeit even sometimes very considerable because his personal labor is equally valuable and probably more so than the labor of a man of superior rank so that even the happy system of frankpledge itself is very materially improved and rendered much more effectual as well as more profitable by the proposed addition  all contempts of legal summonses to labor would of course be finable as also apparent sloth or remissness in working both of which would thereby be made effectual to increase the value of the paper currency instead of diminishing it as might be expected likewise all contempts of court neglects of summons to attend juries want of punctuality in attending the duties of watch and ward in the rotation of the public roster and all inattention or disobedience while on duty all breaches of the sabbath swearing drunkenness and immodesty as well as fornication and adultery both of which should be very strictly and very severely mulcted for the more effectual promotion of honorable marriage giving or accepting a challenge to fight even though no mischief should ensue all unnecessary wrangling fighting or striking and even every wilful provocation by word or gesture and every other misbehaviour that is inconsistent with the peace order and quiet of a happy society would be punished by a suitable fine of days work in proportion to the offense by which altogether this essential article of fines and forfeitures which in england through neglect of frankpledge are hardly an object of consideration would necessarily occasion a much larger addition to the public revenue than i can venture at present to estimate and therefore i must beg leave to reserve this valuable article of fines to make up any deficiencies which perhaps may be afterward discovered in my other calculations to which must also be added as a further reserve the profits arising from the sale of land for day labor not yet estimated though it would probably amount even to more than the fines  i have already without these profitable articles carried my estimation of the public revenue nearly to the amount of  000l per annum for every  00 families including equally both rich and poor which far exceeds the proportionable revenue i believe of any kingdom on earth for indeed the same means are not practicable in any country or nation unless the most excellent system of frankpledge be previously established which i must frequently repeat but for the sake of comparison let us apply this scheme to the computed average number of taxable houses or families in england and wales the one million families as they are commonly estimated would raise by merely taking on themselves the very moderate and equal burden of only a  th part of their most ordinary labor estimated at the low rate of one shilling per day together with the additional tax on pride and the easy levy on profitable occupations with the due increase of the whole profit when applied to the cultivation of public land would raise i say at the rate of   0 l for every hundred families before calculated the amazing revenue of    millions and  0 thousands of pounds sterling per annum if i am questioned on the possibility of raising a sum so enormously great that it far exceeds the whole annual produce of all our accumulated taxes customs and other means of revenue i must confess that i am at a loss how even to satisfy my own doubts about it and that i know not what reasons to assign for such an incredible accumulation of wealth arising from so trifling a burden laid upon the people unless it may be attributed to the effectual employment of all the laboring poor and of others capable of labor and also to the effectual means of which the proposition seems to promise of rendering that general employment of ordinary labor profitable not only in the circulation of the indentures as bills and cash but also in the increase which may be naturally expected from the actual labor when applied to the earth but there are other advantages attending the proposal which are not yet reckoned  the previous reestablishment of frankpledge without which the raising of such an increased revenue could not be practicable would at the same time render absolutely unnecessary the greatest part of our most expensive establishments both civil and military  so that upon the whole the gain might fairly be estimated at nearly triple the effective or neat amount of all the other deviseable  ways and means etc etc  that this is not an exaggerated statement of our public burdens will be allowed i believe by all parties i wish they were equally agreed in opinion about the necessary remedy  granville sharp old jewry  d july
