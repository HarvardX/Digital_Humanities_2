the absolute and indispensible duty of christians in this critical juncture considered and enforced in an affectionate address  by w mason  arm yourselves   pet iv   it is high time romans xiii    quit yourselves like men be strong   cor xiii   london printed and sold by m lewis no   paternosterrow j mathews in the strand and t fisher at rochester       price twopence or one shilling and sixpence per dozen  the absolute and indispensible duty of christians etc brethren and fellow christians   so i would call and love all and every one without the least regard to name sect or party who believe the sacred truths of the bible hope in the precious promises of god in christ and obey his holy commands in love this faith hope love and obedience constitute the true christian if any of these be wanting the christian character is desective the christian dares no more to cavil against and wilfully disobey any one command of god than he dates to call in question any of the sacred truths of god for faith binds hope confirms and love constrains to universal obedience to gods laws therefore the christian esteems his bible as the warrant for his faith the ground of his hope and the rule of his conduct and there is no one station of life but the word of god commands how we should act in it no one circumstance in life but it directs how we should behave under it therefore obedience to the revealed will of god and a concern for his glory is and ever will be esteemed by all christians the primary and chief object of their attention and regard    to such i would humbly address some few words respecting their conduct in the present day when the voice of the multitude is heard on high crying out for liberty upon you o christians would i call in scripture language arm yourselves  it is high time  quit yourselves like men  arm yourselves in your own defense with the word of truth and righteousness on the right and and on the left so as not to sin against your god arm yourselves with the same mind which that word requires of you and expects from you so as to obey and please god it is high time when the voice of licentiousness is heard and a liberty to violate the precepts of your god abounds for you to be zealous for his glory and to beware lest you follow the multitude to do evil quit yourselves like men who fear god and act under the influence of his holy commands    would you exercise yourselves to have a conscience void of offense both toward god and man respecting your conduct in the present day beware of your spirit and temper see that both be under the rule and direction of gods word it is at our peril to disobey the plain positive and express commands of our god the bible is our best rule in politics no other scheme of politics shall i presume to meddle with or recommend that teaches that requires us to be religious politicians so as at all times in all places and under all circumstances from obedient hearts to our god with loyalty and affection to his majesty to shout with united voices god save the king this is the spirit and temper which the bible inspires    consider our love of and loyalty to our king arises from the consideration that god has set him over us love and loyalty to him are not imposed on us by the authority of fallible men only but chiefly from the positive commands of our almighty god therefore love and loyalty to the king is our absolute and indispensible duty and a spirit and temper contrary to this is not only inconsistent with the faith of a christian but also a violation of the express commands of our god had i not seen and heard with deep concern and heart felt sorrow such a spirit and temper exalted in those whom i love and from whom i hoped better things i should have been silent on this subject and not have troubled you with this address but seeing things are so is there not a cause bear with me in love i befeech you be not offended with me i pray you i would willingly offend no one i desire to follow peace with all men but duty to my god allegiance to my king and a real concern for your good unitedly constrain me thus to address and earnestly entreat you calmly to consider what is required of us what is expected from us as our duty both in respect to our god and our king i am inclined to think and willing to hope that the failing of christians herein arises from want of due consideration and close attention to the express commands of god in his holy word for we are most solemnly enjoined  to honor the king to pray for the king to be subject to the king   let us therefore my fellow christians as in the presence of god before whom we must shortly appear and to whom we must all account consider these points   st honor the king   pet ii    as this command stands closely connected with another fear god does it not therefore instantly strike our minds with this idea if we fear god we shall honor the king if the king is not honored of us god is not feared by us there is a close and inseparable connection between these commands both are enforced under the sanction of the same authority the word of god if we are influenced by the former we shall obey the latter what god has joined together let no man dare to put asunder    but who was king when this command was given to the primitive christians to honor him even nero that wicked tyrant that cruel persecutor that inveterate enemy to christians what honor such a wretch did you ever hear or read of such an objection from the mouth of any one of the primitive christians can you produce one single instance of any one of the apostles or first christians speaking evil of dignities or refusing to honor them however cruelly they were treated by them nay was it not their constant doctrine and practice render honor to whom honor is due romans xiii   therefore this command to honor such a king as nero was is a blow at the heart a stab to the vitals a deathwound to every objection against obeying this command honor the king    but be the king what he may our duty to god is the same think of him as you please yet this dissolves not your obligation to obey gods command god has not sent an angel to reign over us but a man of like passions with ourselves i love and honor the king for his princely virtues and amiable qualities it is neither your duty nor mine to think speak or hear of any faults he may be accused lest we get disaffected to him let us look at home mend our own and we shall be much better employed for it is adding to the number of our sins to disobey god by not honoring the king let us therefore do our duty obey gods command honor our king and so shall we please our god let us think well and speak well of him asone whom god has chosen exalted and set over us for he says by me kings reign prove viii    consider that word    when the apostle exhorts children obey your parents he adds in the lord ephesians vi   as it is the mind and will of the lord the command of the lord well pleasing in his sight and makes for his glory therefore should be done for his sake so let us honor the king in the lord obey our lord by honoring the king as it is his mind and will is his command is well pleasing in his sight is to his glory and should be done for the lords sake so peter exhorts submit to the king for the lords sake   pet ii    this is to honor the king in faith as believing him to be set over us in the lord and this faith works by love and will lead us to honor the king in love    love covers the multitude of faults love thinks no evil speaks no evil hears no evil against the king love puts the best constructions upon the behavior hides faults with its vail and casts a mantle of kindness over failings like the painter i think apelles who drew the picture of alexander with his finger upon the scar on his face so love has a finger to hide scars and blemishes and cover failings and infirmities does the lord command us thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself what love then is due from us to our king such love as will carry out our affections toward him so as that we shall think no ill speak no ill hear no ill against him and totally disregard all disloyal reports concerning him love will restrain us from doing any thing to grieve his royal heart or cause the crown to sit heavy on his sacred head yea love will make us active in doing every thing in our power to honor the king consistent with the duty we owe him the allegiance we are bound in to him and the honor we are commended by our god to give him vain and specious only are all professions of love honor and reverence to the king while we entertain groundless suspicions of him and pursue such steps as tend to disturb his peace or perplex his government but the enquiry of an obedient heart to our god and of a loving loyal heart to our king will be what shall be done to the man whom the king of kings delights to honor our duty as christians binds us our love as christians constrains us thus to honor our king and therefore of you my brethren and fellow christians may i not in the apostles words demand show me your faith by your works make it manifest that you do believe in god by your obedience to this his sacred command honor the king if you do you will   0 secondly pray for the king we are solemnly enjoined by gods sacred word to pray for kings and for all who are in authority   timothy ii   this i am positively sure of were there more praying for the king there would be less evil speaking against the king and were there more faith in gods word there would be more obedience to his will and command in more cordially honoring and heartily praying for the king in doing this we not only obey gods word but we honor the king of kings by carrying our kings cause presenting his person and interest and the concerns of his kingdom at the throne of gods grace referring all these matters to him seeking every blessing and direction from him and leaving all events with him o this praying for the king would not only expel the rancorous seeds of rebellion which are so rife in our corrupt natures but would also more heartily conciliate our affections to the king and heighten our esteem of him there is a mighty power in prayer to charm away all evil thoughts of the person we pray for and to beget love to him and esteem of him all who try the experiment prove the truth of the doctrine do not you neglect it     but adds the apostle as a cogent reason for this duty  that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty for this is good and acceptable in the sight of god our savior   timothy ii     i am not addressing those who live in the total neglect of prayer it is not to be expected that those who do not pray for themselves will either pray for the king or any one else from such i expect nothing but the contemptuous sneer and the indignant frown for all i have said upon the christians duty this i can bear such i can pity because they see not their own mercies but slight and despise gods sacred truths and solemn commands yet even such i should be sorry designedly to offend but it is you my fellow christians to whom i appeal you who love and delight to do that which is good and acceptable in the sight of god our savior and desire to lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty you cannot but see how closely connected your duty of praying for the king and for all in authority is with the enjoyment of these great blessings and precious mercies quietness peace godliness and honesty whence those tumults discords distractions disaffection to government ungodliness and dishonesty which are so displeasing to god our savior do they not subsist and will they not increase among us while the duty of praying for the king and for all in authority is neglected by us but the man of prayer will pray them away from his heart and will live them down in his life for all such will     thirdly submit to the king for we are commanded let every soul be subject unto the higher powers romans xiii   here is a positive and comprehensive precept no one can plead exemption from it it is enforced with the most powerful reason why every one should obey it  for there is no power but of god the powers that be are ordained of god and this precept is backed with a most severe threatening  whosoever therefore resists the power resists the ordinance of god and they who resist shall receive to themselves damnation pray now do not rise in anger rebel in wrath and cry out in fury i cannot bear this away with it this is the obsolete long since exploded doctrine of passive obedience and nonresistance which neither we nor our forefathers couldbear baptize it by what hard name you please call it scandalum magnatum if you will still this will not destroy its divine authority dissolve your obligation to obey it nor reverse the sentence of wrath denounced against those who disobey it     as to passive obedience and nonresistance as a mere human doctrine taught and contended for by any man i know nothing about it i never read one page of human composition for or against it nor do i think ever shall but if you please this divine precept shall pass under your title passive obedience and nonresistance is there any thing so very formidable so very dreadful to a christians ear or a christians heart to be passively obedient to gods holy word to be nonresistant to all his sacred commands why then this tragical outcry against submission to the king subjection to the higher powers sure i am it carries this sanction from the mouths and pens of all gods holy prophets and apostles so we taught it bears this impress from the tongues of all primitive christians and so we believed and it is enjoined us by the most powerful most endearing and most engaging motive  submit yourselves to every ordinance of man whether it be to the king as supreme or unto governors which are sent by him for  the lords sake   pet ii           for the lords sake christians how do your hearts feel at the urging this plea and advancing this motive for your submission to the king and subjection to the higher powers can you resist it dare you reject it where then is your faith in and love to your lord you are called to a duty which however irksome to flesh and blood however contrary to human pride and carnal reasonings however opposed by men of corrupt minds who know not god and reject his revealed word yet to you it comes enforced with this most solemn this most prevailing reason for the lords sake as though the apostle had said for the sake of the lord jesus christ whom you believe in as your savior who taught you to render unto caesar the things which are caesars for the honor of the profession you make of him by the obedience you owe to him for the sake of the glory you are bound to give him for the hope you have in him the expectation you have from him and as you will answer it at the last day when you shall be judged by him act agreeable to your character as bearing his name and be obedient to his laws by submitting yourselves unto the king for his sake and being subject unto the higher powers for the honor and glory of him     surely you will not evade the force of this and object and say as a deep sighted politician and selfdenying christian once did when i was urging this doctrine true the first christians were in an infantile state few in number and weak in power therefore for them to be thus subject and submit themselves was wise and politic but now the case is altered as we have power and strength sufficient to right ourselves we ought to use them in our own cause i admire his cunning while i marvel how any who profess to be christians and to believe the bible can reason thus a small interpolation would just adapt the ancient scripture to his modern taste for when paul says let every soul be subject to the higher powers it is only to add until they have sufficient power to resist them and cast off submission to them is not this to trifle with the sosolemn invariable commands of a holy jealous sinavenging god who that fears god would dare act thus by the  th commandment and cast off all duty to his parents because he is of years to help himself     but the apostle adds wherefore ye must needs be subject not only for wrath but also for conscience sake romans xiii   that adage conscience makes cowards of us all in some sortholds good inrespect to the christians conduct conscience makes the christian a coward in any service which is contrary to the will and commands of his god but a good conscience toward god inspires him with the truest courage the greatest fortitude and the boldest magnanimity in his service therefore the christian cannot dare not commence a traitor to his king and a rebel against his government for he knows he would thereby subject himself to the wrath of the higher powers and expose himself to the punishment of the wholesome and penal laws enacted against such conduct but besides this fear of wrath he has a higher and more noble principle from which he acts in submitting to his king and being subject to the higher powers even for conscience sake conscience toward god to honor and obey the king to pray for him to submit to him and to be subject to the higher powers under him all this to the christian is a conscientious matter therefore he must needs be subject the peace of his conscience is at stake to act contrary to gods will would not only deprive him of gods peace in his conscience but bring the sense of guilt the fear of wrath and the terror of condemnation upon him see then the close connection there is between obeying the will of god in submitting to the king and enjoying peace of conscience from god     now here we see what is true patriotism bible christian patriotism a true patriot fears god and is obedient to his commands he honors the king prays for the king and submits to the king not only for fear of wrath but also for conscience sake conscience toward god because this is the command and will of god all such are true patriots real lovers of their country and all such are worthy of reverence and honor but all patriotism without this is mere farce and specious pretense bombast great swelling words of vanity by which they allure says st peter   pet ii    such patriotism is begun without principle is carried on without the fear of god and will end in shame and confusion to talk of such being true patriots real lovers of their country who do not fear god and honor the king but are open enemies to god by wicked works reminds us of satan transforming himself into an angel of light     as our bible gives us the character of true patriots real lovers of their country so it also laysdown a full description of mock and pretended ones that we may beware of them be armed against them and not be beguiled by them says st peter they walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness and despise government presumptuous are they and selfwilled they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities  while they promise them liberty they themselves are the servants of corruption   pet  0     with this st jude agrees he scruples not to call them filthy dreamers who defile the flesh despise dominion and speak evil of dignities jude   fine patriots fine lovers of their country are such should such persons stand forth and assume the name of patriots and with the foul breath of slander strive to incense and inflame the minds of his majestys subjects against him it is high time to be on our guard to arm ourselves with the word of god against their nefarious designs and to quit ourselves like men like christians who fear god and honor the king it is our wisdom not to be beguiled by them it is our duty to beware of them lest we catch the infectious the wide spreading poison from them of despising dominion and speaking evil of dignities for this is equally as contrary to the word of god as greatly displeasing to god and as highly unbecoming us as christians as any of the other sins enumerated     talk they of liberty o ye sons of liberty ye warm contenders for freedom i join hand and heart with you carry your cause as high as you will and extend it as far as you please only let it be bounded by this sacred barrier the law of god and a good conscience beyond this what christian dare go for all beyond this is not christian liberty but lawless licentiousness from which we ought most heartily to pray good lord deliver us and may he give us grace to obey the king cheerfully and willingly for conscience sake that neither our sinful passions nor our private interests may disappoint his cares for the public good may he possess the hearts of his people that they may never be wanting in honor to his person and dutiful submission to his authority and seeing the commands of fear god honor the king are so closely joined and so inseparably connected therefore while with a holy fear of god and with exultation of heart in him we shout with the people of old the lord he is the god the lord he is the god may we add with the same breath in loyalty and affection god save the king god save the king and let all the people say amen  postscript the present prospect of our affairs is truly melancholy affecting and alarming does not this call loudly upon us to obey this command of god let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice and be ye kind to one another tender hearted forgiving one another even as god for christs sake has forgiven you ephesians iv       ah my brethren sure i am this would be more pleasing to our god and savior than all that unchristian party strife and fiery contention about politics which so unhappily prevails among us surely instead of imputing our troubles to this and the other cause it rather behooves us to consider our sins mourn over our sins humble ourselves under the mighty hand of god for our sins and forsake our sins which are so highly provoking to god for which he has a controversy with us and which are the real ground of our national calamities and the true cause of all our present distresses the lords voice cries unto the city  hear ye the rod and who has appointed it micah vi    it is devoutly to bewished that a day may be set apart by authority for a general fast in which we might unitedly humble ourselves before god turn to him and seek him with our whole hearts confess and bewail our sins in his sight cry mightily unto him to avert impending deserved judgments from us direct to some speedy method of abolishing the present unhappy differences between us and our colonies so as to prevent the farther effusion of blood the dire ravages of war and conciliate not only all matters in dispute between us but also our hearty affection to each other o how earnestly is this to be coveted is any thing too hard for the lord no therefore in the faith of this we ought constantly and fervently to pray for the accomplishment of this happy event for who knows if the lord will return and repent and leave a blessing behind him joel ii     finis
