memoirs of t wilkinson  vol i  memoirs of his own life by tate wilkinson patentee of the theatresroyal york and hull  in four volumes   if i had held my pen but half as well as i have held my bottle  what a charming hand i should have wrote by this time vol i  york printed for the author by wilson spence and mawman and sold by g g j and j robinson paternosterrow and t and j egerton whitehall london anno    0  to his grace the duke of norfolk my lord duke to a patron of the muses this would indeed be an intrusive and contemptible offering as i cannot claim even the most distant relationship with the sister arts and if i were to assume only a familiar and easy acquaintance i should be instantly detected as a silly though not an artful impostor i must therefore slide imperceptibly into your graces presence under the fallacious and specious pretext of being a dangling twigcousin of the alluring theaters to which your grace is a wellknown avowed friend amateur and protector as they evidently are honored with your graces neverfailing tribute and support  therefore under the guardian shades of melpomene and thalia i am emboldened by hope to cast my defenseless work at your graces feet imploring mercy and pity for my lack of skill and nonacquaintance with the muses the work indeed is a true picture of its master being as destitute of wit as wealth  the concurring evils of its poverty and want of natural brilliant endowments preclude i fear every possible chance of good fortune for preserving its life with the worlds approbation unless when they behold with wonder your graces condescension in raising the supplicating mendicant from the ground and crowning its insignificance with your good wishes which must be ever regarded as an honored and gracious fostering and who knows by being thus adorned with the duke of norfolks name in its front but it may make so brilliant an appearance as to obtain a passport into the presence of the most noble and worthy and by such unmerited good fortune its sickly life may not only be preserved from instant perishing but prolonged even after its insignificant parent shall inevitably be obliterated from the smallest traces of memory as your graces goodness wit and understanding will live for ages and perhaps occasionally be the means of restoring a faint glimering in theatrical dark passages of him who during his life has ever been with true gratitude and respectful homage  your graces much honored highly obliged and obedient humble servant tate wilkinson york october       0 preface good reader be kind courteous merciful and forgiving for how would you be if he who is the top of judgment should but judge you as you are oh think on that and mercy then will breathe within your lips like man new made  this confused motley incoherent medley  this something or this nothing of a work was undertaken without any premeditation or note whatever and finished heedlessly during a severe painful and tedious illness occasioned by a dreadful fractured leg  the time greatly interfered upon with the constant and unavoidable vexations disappointments and accidents that will ever be the natural attendants on the conductor of a theater as the difficulty of pleasing before and behind the curtain requires at least no common share of wit but as i was unable to move and was ever addicted to the witching time of night it helped to alleviate many distressed hours  as to wit i profess it not yet here and there it will start unexpectedly as the quotations are so variously sprinkled and either witness for or against me but i may surely be permitted to quote as the ablest and most ingenious men do the same no matter how elevated in rank and station and are frequently heard by the lords and commons and even at the learned bar on the most serious occasions neither is the holy pulpit entirely exempt from this practice the esteemed samuel white esquire of dublin remarks that every class of life has its pedants those of a theatrical turn show their predilection in their use of theatrical allusions and citations from plays on every occasion happily exemplified in the character of the apprentice here the writer takes eave once for all to acknowledge that he has studiously imitated the turn of expression and adopted a favorite phrase from any passage alluded to in other writers without particularizing it by any mark or intimation deeming it superfluous to the learned reader who needs no monitor to recognize an old acquaintance and may be pleased to meet it in a novel and unexpected situation to the less learned it would be empty parade and disfigure the page to no end our most eminent poets have freely indulged themselves in this practice  pope especially  but as he resorted to the ancients and works not commonly known it has not been generally noticed and by most who have observed it esteemed a beauty as a stage chronologer i flatter myself this work besides its authenticity possesses stage materials and many whimsical situtions that in the hands of a mr mu py might have been so pleasingly dreed as to have sustained the being viewed and examined but i fear like bays i have a knak of making myself not understood  i mean it a a kind of register for all persons attached to the theaters and who wish for information relative to the london and dublin stages it may reve an heavy hour on a rainy day and to thatrical proessors i think i may recommend it as containing as impartial and true an account of the progress of the principal events of playhoues as any book i an recollect on the subjet and at the same time truly lament its thousand deficiencies and improprieties which i am sensible will be insuperabe bars to its prosperity  however i wrap myself in one idea which is i think it will not cannot be on examination more indifferently and contemptuously estimated than all my friens and ven my foes combined i dare suppose expect it to be and i as freely declare on the perusal it is better with all its prolixity than i ever expected it would or could be but i must in its behalf request my readers to observe as a strict truth that the printers to their incessant fatigue can testify there never has been one regular sheet or a legible one and though a strange assertion it is incontrovertibly true the incorrectness of what i had scratched down from one corner to the other was not intelligible even to myself the day following and therefore it was next to impossible to properly divine the meaning consequently many passages and words have been misconstrued and unavoidably retained and printed and hence several of my wise observations and informations from absolute necessity have been entirely obliterated or not properly inserted frequently from my own splashings and alterations as i so bewildered the printers that they declared it incomprehensible and impossible to proceed  that they never had such a job in their lives and heartily prayed they never might have such another  however the press after groaning has produced to light the misshapen deformity indeed it may with propriety be observed as matter of surprise all circumstances considered that my truly good friend in the fulest sense of the word mr wilson has accomplished a work in ten months in spite of the several insurmountable obstacles and striking impediments which obstructed its ever gliding smoothly into the road of either credit or fame all this considered will easily gain kind allowance why its delay need not be wondered at and my lameness apologize for tardy steps for when i first printed the proposals i had at that time only begun the toilsome task i had set myself and though brevity is the first word i fear tautology would with justice seize the eldership and right the tablet being an afterthought rendered some repetition requisite and several anecdotes are omitted there as a reference to the first and second volumes will supply many deficiencies  the reader will allow for the different dates i have mentioned when writing and not allude to the year of perusal for an account of mrs baker whose letters conclude vol iv see vol iii page     mentioning london performers in a future publication entitled the wandering patentee is to be understood as meant not to extend beyond those who have favored the york theater with their services not to the performers at large as that would be taking too great a liberty  but notwithstanding its ricketty origin be it known to all men that there is a secret pride which however i would endeavor to conceal will burst out when i perceive four volumes in print  by tate wilkinson i re on it with astonishment and look with wonder at my patience and perseverance as philosophy and steadiness i dare assert rarely attend my hobbing morning or evening walks every one will readily admit the materials to be the genuine spinning from my own brain and allow me like touchstone to be contented with my own illfavored thing which no one else will claim i must observe it has been a tedious collection from memory not having a single note except the interspersed genuine letters and ancient playbills which have been preserved merely by accident not design from the ruins of time and snatched from the blaze of hundreds except two printed playbills one of      the other    0 as inserted in the memoirs i am not possessed of one prior to      all the others are actually from memory  if my ability equalled my inclination it would be as elegant and heartfelt an offering as real genius ever presented to a discerning public such as it is i submissively request their acceptance of it and like goodwilled franciss pennyworth of sugar can only lament it is not better  now earnestly wishing for more friends without the need and their every prosperity  i am their highly indebted much obliged and respectful humble servant etc tate wilkinson york october       0 nb to mr swalwell i look on myself as much indebted for the business could never have proceeded but from his incessant exertions and indefatigable perseverance    subscribers names a ailesbury the rt hon the

brevity is the soul of wit  i am sorry for my own sake as well as for those who have the patience and good nature to peruse this motley work to observe that it will be dreadfully deficient in both these material articles  however that the reader may not be kept in suspense and then complain that the mountain after a tedious labor has at length brought forth only a mouse i will without further ceremony proceed  i tate wilkinson whose various stage adventures and sparrings have been permitted and favored with acceptance more or less in almost every principal theater in the three kingdoms as drury lane covent garden haymarket  smockalley and crowstreet dublin  bath edinburgh portsmouth winchester maidstone birmingham chester bristol norwich york shrewsbury richmond in surry exeter glasgow newcastle leeds lynn pontefract halifax doncaster hull wakefield etc  am the son of the late rev dr john wilkinson who was educated at st bees in cumberland and finished his studies at the university of oxford and who suffered transportation under the well remembered marriage act in      he was his majestys chaplain of the savoy also chaplain to his late royal highness frederic prince of wales rector of coyty in the county of glamorgan and stipendarycurate of wise in the county of kent  the late lord galway with whom he was particularly acquainted presented him with a gift which yielded a right to open plaisterpits in the honor of pontefract the original grant was to robert monkton late of hoderoyde in the county of york father to the aforesaid lord galway the right from the duchyoffice was in    0  those plaisterpits were sold to a mr jenkinson near ferrybridge but how they turned out it never lay in my way to get information  grace wilkinson his wife was daughter of william tate esquire who was for many years one of the aldermen of the city of carlisle and often chosen mayor of that ancient corporation for above forty years patent searcher of his majestys customs there and at the port of whitehaven  a gentleman of undoubted loyalty the said grace wilkinson when she intermarried with the rev john wilkinson brought him two thousand pounds at that time judged a very genteel fortune  dr wilkinsons affairs having been for many years greatly embarrassed not only hers but all his own acquisitions were entirely exhausted to satisfy the demands of his own creditors and those of others for whom he had become indiscreetly engaged  i tate wilkinson son to the said john and grace was born october         and by my fathers sentence of transportation was likely to have been irretrievably ruined i was at that critical period at the age of seventeen  not brought up to any business or profession  of a very indifferent constitution  and neither mother nor son had the least independency  previous to this unfortunate event my father and mother had been connected with the most leading families and were universally acquainted in london the consequence most fortunately for myself as will appear hereafter was that from the intercourse of visiting they formed intimate connexions with several leading persons of the kingdom of ireland which was the foundation of the happiest future consequences to me as will in the narrative be verified  several of these families every year resorted to london where they ever found hospitality and a cheerful welcome at our mansion in the savoy  amongst our various visitors were lord and lady forbes from the sister kingdom they were so attached to my father and mother as to be almost inseparable that intimacy subsisted on so strong a basis and formed so firm a friendship that they used to call me their own boy tate and their dear georges only particular friend they promised to fix me genteelly in life and were certain if george lived to be earl of granard tate would be well provided for  airy castles too often gain belief and dependence when of a sudden they disappear and wake the deluded dreamer from his transitory vision and in lieu present a true mirror in which he views his actual state  not that i mean these promises in all probability would not have been performed but the wheel of fate is so uncertain perplexing and various as evinces the truth of shakspeare  we all know what we are but know not what we may be  this intimacy with the forbes family was carried on more like a modern novel than a common acquaintance young george forbes was born april      0  i was not permitted to wear breeches until the same day appointed for george the  d of april      lady forbes notwithstanding title and great expectations in life was not without many of her days being embittered  her heart and mind were softened by the too often experiencing humiliating events disappointments and afflictions she was related to lord blessington and lady tyrawley and was niece to lady granard and bred up under her care her eldest son young lord forbes as he ripened into manhood by frequent intercourse with his lovely relation soon became a willing slave to the irresistible qualities of his captivating cousin she gave him grace for grace and love for love yielded to his entreaties and they were privately married   the maid that loves goes out to sea upon a shattered plank and puts her trust in miracles for safety trusting as many young couples do when the irrevocable knot was tied that submission and entreaty with a promise of forgiveness  this once and i will do so no more but age on these occasions is either soon softened or like the everlasting flint is hard and obdurate and in that instance was so to such a degree as rendered supplication tears and remonstrance only incentives to increase instead of lessening the vengeance denounced  that steeled character on that occasion was exemplified in the severest degree and executed with a roman strictness  for the earl of granard not only banished his son lord forbes from his presence for ever but on the cruel supposition that lady granard had connived at the match he in the most stern and sudden manner separated himself from her ladyship and never after saw or spoke to her all mdiation of families no matter of what rank were vain  in this he was fixed and acted as resolutely as our stage count of narbonne  lady granard to prove her disapprobation of the match and to regain the affections of her lord instead of consolation and comfort to her niece lady forbes in her then calamitous situation vowed never to behold her more and in this determination she was as resolute as a roman matron and proved she possessed as steeled a mind as her inexorable lord  in one point only the female breast gave way to natural feeling  young george she saw cherished and adored and often had him while young at her house in argyle buildings near sohosquare  but the grandfather never yielded to the ties of affinity  he lived chiefly retired at his own seat of castle forbes in ireland  lord forbes was generally with his regiment at gibraltar or with the regiment on its return to ireland  he had a house in stephensgreen dublin and occasionally made a secret excursion to england to visit his wife and son who chiefly resided at her house in richmond buildings deanstreet soho the son was at or before seven years old put to a mr blacks boardingschool at chiswick where i was often taken as a visitor  when turned of eleven her ladyship and son received orders to repair to dublin on this occasion her ladyship took with her a carpet for her drawing room esteemed beautiful the work of my mother and i dare say it is in the family to this day with several elegant worked skreens in tent stitch executed by the same good ingenious hand  about the age of thirteen he was brought back to england to finish his education and then to be placed in his majestys guards our meeting on his arrival in england as may be imagined was very joyous he was placed under the care of a mr gibson a rigid scotchman also under the eye of his uncle admiral forbes he was soon sent to harrowschool i was eager to follow him and in another year that wish was accomplished of which a particular account will occur in the theatrical history and it will claim a short attention  but of the young hero i am now speaking when about sixteen he was in possession of his majestys colors and often on guard at the savoy he grew very dissipated while under the direction of a mr durel when not on duty at his academy in kingsstreet goldensquare but as he could not be kept within bounds lady forbes from the accounts transmitted to ireland being greatly alarmed and fearful he should incur the displeasure of his father entreated his lordship to grant her the inspection and guardianship of her son in london till he grew nearer a proper time of life to be trusted to the care of himself this point was settled and an house once more taken in the old spot richmond buildings  at first all seemed to promise fair and a mrs wilson who had for many years been companion to lady forbes a sister of mrs kelly wife of honest old cornelius kelly now living in dublin was the person appointed to hint any private displeasure to our young captain the fond mother seemed intoxicated with the prospect of happiness before her delighted imagination but of a sudden on the nonappearance of george for a few days she experienced the most alarming anxiety which after fruitless enquiries was at last cleared up by a young couple from gretna green imploring her blessing her fortitude forsook her and her exclamations of grief surprise and terror for the consequences with lord forbes and the dread of every horrid indignation from the old earl overwhelmed her with the most poignant distress for she well foresaw that every ill that fatally occurred would be attributed to her needless assumption of residing in london  and instead of preventing would be accused of encouraging her son in every false step nor had she presence of mind nor fortitude sufficient at the first shock to enquire who this daughter was but as soon as reason could resume its seat dreading an increasing tale of woe yet obliged to require information which being truly given mitigated her uneasiness and was most happily relieved on being pleasingly informed he had married a daughter of sir nicholas baily though her expectations of fortune on enquiring were but small she proved a young lady of promise fit to adorn any exalted station in life matters were ill received in ireland but by degrees his lordship became better reconciled than could be expected  by this amiable young lady the family were blessed with the present earl of granard now in dublin      but she soon after fell into a decay and like a lily drooping died it was during this part of their history the reader will suppose when i hereafter speak of lady forbes that young gentlemans mother that i received such favors when first acting in london  soon after the death of that amiable young lady the earl of granard died but not before he was reconciled at the last to his son and grandson then become lord forbes and his father of course the earl of granard the young lord married a lady of quality in london soon after his second marriage he became earl of granard but from modern fashions was separated from his lady  he went to ireland his mother went with him but being then in possession of all his wishes in point of rank and fortune i am truly grieved to add he grew dissipated and of course so very rapidly involved as inevitably lost him all consequence and esteem amongst those where his rank entitled him to every respect and increase of popularity and dignity to close my account of a gentleman so much my superior and for whom i had the strongest attachments and every reason to expect friendship and lasting regard if promises and professions may be supposed to allow a claim added to the intercourse of many years i will finish this portrait by mentioning when i was last in dublin in      he was constantly with me by ten oclock in a morning and i often passed the evening with him at his house in myrionstreet near myrionsquare but three nights before my return to england my company on thursday june   was particularly desired to meet mr lee attorney at law on urgent business it was our last meeting the mighty business was to be a witness to his will which he mr lee now living in dublin drew up  no not even a ring to his memory  nor at my benefit which was on the   th of may did he so much as take a box or even a box ticket  but was there in person  so much for friendship  so much for dependence  but i must not omit that whenever i paid my respects in myrionstreet there was plenty  nay even a profusion of half pints of claret burgundy etc had he regarded himself more i might perhaps have profited by our strong intimacy imbibed from childhood  let this be a lesson to place as much as possible our chief dependence on ourselves rather than rely on ideal hopes or promises from superiors  how did i retire home to my lodging that evening is a natural question  why good reader whoever thou art i assure you not unhappily  i reflected that had the earl felt for his own welfare he would in all probability have retained some portion of feeling and humanity for his old  his intimate friend  and when reclined on my pillow found myself at that moment possessed of every supply for my wants with health and spirits to support those wants i felt myself comparatively the greatest man of the two he did not live many years after the spring      the young lady granard of whom i have not the least knowledge i believe is married in ireland  the lady dowager granard was ever my staunch friend she retired to england and died within these few years at her villa some miles from london  the present lord granard i am told bears his blushing honors thick upon him pray god he may have no frost to nip them but restore his family laurels to their pristine health and vigor and with many years enjoy that felicity long wanting to his predecessors  he is spoke of in the warmest terms by all that know him as a distinguished nobleman and a finished gentleman  i never saw him but feel an attachment from my knowledge of and favors conferred by his family in a course of years  this little history i hope will not be found tiresome to the reader particularly if perused by a native of ireland and flatter myself it will pass without censure for besides being authentic i mean as i pursue my historical journal to mix various anecdotes and occurrences without making it merely a languid stage repetition several little traits of the same complexion and degree will be introduced which i hope the reader will honor me with patience to endure as they will in some measure prove relieving explanatory entertaining and indeed are absolutely necessary as a key to the whole  but to return to my savoy history  added to the noble family lately recurred to were mr and mrs william chaigneau from dublin he was agent to most of the regiments on the irish establishment a gentleman universally known and whose memory is greatly respected he wrote for his amusement the novel in two volumes called jack connor  mrs chaigneau was a lady who attracted the good opinion of every one they had only one daughter whom they termed their darling peggy this lovely pledge they could not part with on their excursions from ireland to england indeed so careful were they  they permitted not the winds of heaven to visit her face too roughly  mrs teague mrs chaigneaus sister an intimate of my mothers honored me by standing as my godmother at my baptism and in the chit chat and want of matter for conversation when all were convened a few years after at the friendly fireside they proposed a wedding between master tate wilkinson and miss peggy chaigneau this was agreed to and my father actually performed the ceremony and we were afterward jokingly called man and wife i believe i might be at this mock marriage six or seven  young peggy about five or six but to the lasting grief of mr and mrs chaigneau they lost the idol of their heart in two or three years afterward and i was left a disconsolate young widower i mention this childish incident as it leads to more serious matter hereafter in this journal of events and momentous history  alderman forbes and his lady  the well known ancient cornelius kelly and his wife  and many others made up a convivial irish party at our cheerful board my father being more attentive to the pleasures than the cares of the world i was sometimes at a boardingschool sometimes not perhaps six months in the year at chelsea with a mr bellas in churchlane there the other six at home the next six months at mr tempests near wandsworth then again at home particularly if the winter was severe some time afterward i had tutors at home then i went to harrow school but that i shall hereafter have occasion to mention as introductory to something historical and whimsical  it will here easily be perceived i was a great pet which too often produces ignorance and stupidity and ends in misfortunes in short the best part of my little education may be chiefly attributed to the cares and observations of a truly sensible worthy affectionate and amiable mother whose conduct was such as not only to attract but preserve the esteem of all who knew her nor is her name ever mentioned to this hour by any person who retains the least recollection of her but it is followed by the sigh of affection and true regard and this equally from superiors or inferiors  my idle hours however were not bestowed on marbles cricket or mixing with intimates of my own age and complexion  for except my friend george forbes i had but few playmates  for lo a prayer book was ever in my hand  the whole day was employed in reading exhortations and every part of the churchservice so great a proficient was i in repeating it that i was often invited to many families to read prayers this early serious turn gave rise to the particular notice of mrs townsend wife of mr richard townsend who lived at the corner of durhamyard near the west end of the since built adelphi this lady was remarkable for exemplary piety accompanied with cheerfulness and good humor from which occurred many acts of charity and benevolence my father had such attraction as a preacher that she would not have missed the savoychurch on a sunday on any account no slight indisposition could keep her away though from a bad state of health the savoychurch was the only place she visited unless on some particular occasion not to be dispensed with  this good old lady was own sister to the late jonas hanway a gentleman universally known and esteemed for his many benevolent acts with this said sister mr jonas hanway ived many years he had been a friend of my fathers continued his good will to me and was indefatigable in the spring      in removing the objections started by lord sondes in regard to my obtaining acts of parliament for the york and hull patents for unless mr jonas hanways influence and perseverance had prevailed on his lordship to withdraw his opposition which at that time from his situation and consequence in the house had great weight it would have prevented in all probability my having acquired the honor and credit of either captain hanway the brother of jonas was married by my father to miss stowe the then reigning toast of newarkupontrent  besides the townsends constant attendance to their religious duties at the savoy amongst my fathers pious admirers as a preacher i remember mrs graham late mrs yates never missed her pew near the pulpit mr yates now living was a frequent attendant and can and will testify that dr wilkinsons manner of reading and preaching commanded respect and admiration his discourses were excellent his voice clear strong and sonorous and his person graceful and handsome the few remaining persons who knew him then will now verify what i advance for though only resident six weeks at wakefield and that not less than fortyfive years ago yet his manner of preaching and forcible oratory etc had such strong effects as to be well recollected at that place to this hour and was often mentioned by the late sir michael pilkington who was at that time his intimate  i being forcibly struck with my fathers manner in the several church services was never easy unless i had an old surplice thrown over my shoulders and my whole delight was in praying preaching burials etc i was generally locked up in a room supposing it a church and in a large chair the bottom taken out went through the morning or evening service as it happened to occur in the course of the day then replacing the chair bottom and throwing off the old surplice of my fathers that had just before occupied my shoulders i mounted and leaned over the back of the said chair and with mighty authority proceeded with the sermon several of which discourses were my fathers  my father was much pleased with this preaching turn and on his hearing from mrs townsend my mother and several others how remarkably well i read prayers and by all universally allowed to be the fathers own son in voice manner energy etc he pronounced tate would make a great figure if brought up to the church  as it occurs to me this moment so i am certain it will to my reader who will ask how could you mr tate so audibly go on with this practice of preaching and praying aloud under the same roof with your father and without his knowledge that is easily answered  for know good sir or madam the house we then occupied was large enough for three modern ones old double stone staircases and were truly the apartments of king john of france see the history of the savoy  when he was prisoner in england so i had always apartments which i called my own and they were in consequence appropriated to my religious rites  my father on the intelligence he had received of my pious inclinations importuned me to read prayers the litany etc by way of sample to corroborate what he had heard from mrs townsend my mother and others i cheerfully complied and on hearing me he much approved and said he judged my seeing plays might aid my strong inclination as well as contribute and assist me in the mode of public speaking now reader dont suppose this fond father and mother were wicked playgoers  i do not remember ever hearing of their being at three plays in their whole lives most probably had that been the case a playhouse would have been familiarized to my ear not that i mean to convey they had a dislike to plays indeed quite the reverse but my fathers affairs were generally in an embarrassed state and my mothers pocket too much deranged to allow money for such an entertainment consequently though she admired and approved of a good play she was contented with the reading instead of seeing it however they both wished to have tate see a play but having been when five years old with my father at a puppetshew at bartholemewfair which i thought a play i there saw a sea fight and a most terrible battle which determined me never to see one again  therefore all proposals to go to the theater were in vain  when about eight years old chance threw a mr page in my way he was then housekeeper of covent garden theater known at that time only by which house do you go to this evening  the new house or the old drury lane mr page wished for some place then in the power of lord cholmondley with whom my father was intimate and to ingratiate himself the more finding neither dr wilkinson nor his wife visited either old or new house he observed it was a pity master tate should not enjoy the diversions of the theater  when i heard this conversation i felt an inconceivable objection and dreaded the being forced into so terrible a place my mother observed that tate would think of prayers only and could not be persuaded to set his foot in a theater but on afterreflection they observed at what an easy rate from the civility of mr page this entertainment could be procured they determined to conquer my obstinacy by force so after my repeated refusals my reverend dad at last grew really angry and insisted on my going there with this conditional salvo that if i was not pleased he pledged his honor he would never urge me to see another i choked with grief assented to this cruelty as i really thought it was and when from the savoy i had with slow steps arrived at southamptonstreet i grew sulky and the servant to whom i was entrusted had actually to drag me to covent garden theater on seeing mr page the man being in livery master tate could not be let into the boxes or pit this i esteemed a lucky circumstance to favor my return indeed had i been left to myself soon would i have saluted the savoy steps but the man wishing to see the play during this new started difficulty kept me fast as his prisoner i was conveyed with him and safely stowed in the upper gallery instead of receiving pleasure sighs and sobs employed my time in this terrible place neither the noble theater nor the music had any charms for me the whistling of the gods and other noises of the gallery only added to my disgust and terror the play i well remember was the busy body with mr footes tea  but o reader of what materials are we composed  scarcely had the first act finished before i imagined i was in the elysium i had been praying for the charms of the church which the day before were so attractive and sublime were dissolved  and like the baseless fabric of a vision left not a wreck behind   the theater from that time banished all my servent piety and my whole thoughts were occupied with the fascinating charms of the playhouse actors and actresses my father  o wicked man says one of the mock saints was pleased with the change and said he was sure it would be the means of making me a better preacher i now reversed my late tabernacle  and employed my evenings in lighting pieces of candle dressing in any fantastical attire and repeated as well as i could recollect parts in plays i had seen which that spring were nine in number from early in january to march i took great care to visit mr page every morning for play bills and was a constant attendant by permission at the morning rehearsals in march i was sent to mr tempests school near wandsworth where a nephew and two sons of mr pages were placed and i saw no more plays till the winter following  at the time i have now mentioned seeing plays at covent garden theater mr quin had retired to bath from whence he wrote the following laconic note in november      i am at bath  yours james quin   which note was as laconically answered stay there and be damned  yours john rich     every actor of consequence was engaged by mr garrick for drury lane except the mr quin just mentioned this was garricks first year a manager at covent garden in the mont of february they only acted three times in the week and frequently dismissed and were in truth a wretched company and low in public estimation mr footes tea which he had given as an entertainment at covent garden theater in february      he had first acted in      at the hay market it was then called the diversions of the morning attended with great good fortune and every success his most sanguine wishes could suggest but this being noticed by the patentees of drury lane and covent garden as an entertainment started in defiance of the severe act about that time passed when lord chesterfield had observed in the house of lords how cruel it was to lay a tax on so scarce a commodity as wit  wit continues lord chesterfield is a sort of property of those that have it and too often the only property they have to depend on  it is indeed but a precarious dependence  thank god we my lords have a dependence of another kind  mr foot had in this moment not only alarmed the treasury of the royal theaters but from his mimicry had roused the indignation and resentment of all the performers application was made in consequence to the lord chamberlain who sent to the justices of that district and the new raised troops were put to flight by a superior force of constables entering the theater in terrible array the audience was dismissed  and the laughing aristophanes left leaning toward melpomene in doleful soliloquy  after many days anxiety from suffering this disgrace a lucky thought occurred to him  being certain of the good will of the town he advertised mr footes compliments to his friends and the public desiring them to drink tea at the little theater at the haymarket every morning at the playhouse prices  the joke succeeded  the house was crowded  and he advanced before the curtain  being privately assured of protection his friends having been previously convened and informed of his intention and said  that while the tea was preparing as he was then training some young actors for the stage he would with their permission proceed with his instructions this maneuver was highly relished and it became the universal fashion every noon to drink a dish of mr footes tea and for two or three years he termed pieces of imitation giving of tea and thence arose the puzzle which often happened to myself some years after on my giving tea and it frequently started difficulties and chagrin to a country audience  the run of this mornings diversion occasioned the actors one and all to exclaim they should be ruined by his mimicry therefore mr foot very pleasantly said since that was the case it was his duty to provide a situation for each lady and gentleman so circumstanced and that instead of murdering blank verse and assuming the characters of kings and queens lords and ladies for which their abilities were far from being suitable he would place them where their talents and behavior could with more propriety be employed  mr quin  from his sonorous voice and weighty manner he appointed  a watchman past twelve oclock and a cloudy morning  mr delane  was supposed to have but one eye therefore he fixed him as  a beggar man in st pauls churchyard would you bestow your pity on a poor blind man  mr ryan  whose voice for oddity and shrillness was remarkable  a razor grinder razors to grind scissars to grind penknives to grind  mrs woffington  though beautiful to a degree had a most unpleasant squeaking pipe  an orange woman to the playhouse would you have some oranges  have some orange chips ladies and gentlemen  would you have some nonpareils  would you have a bill of the play  mr woodward  he was puzzled to find any trade he was fit for therefore spoke the following speech in his voice and manner from sir fopling flutter wherever i go there goes a gentleman  upon my life a gentleman and when you have said a gentleman why o  here foot dropped woodwards voice and manner you have said more than is true  he was also very severe on garrick who was apt to hesitate in his dying scenes in particular as in the character of lothario   adorns my fall and chea  chea  chea  chea  chea  chears my heart in die  die  dying  footes tea remembered by me so well from that time when i became advanced in life made it seem strange that almost every person two hundred miles from the metropolis was not as well acquainted with it as myself who had lived in london without considering my long residence there had stamped a stronger remembrance on me than on three parts out of four of the rest of the inhabitants of that city  to elucidate this matter i need only instance mr footes pieces even of modern date most of them strongly pointed animated and bold in the drawing not destitute of great wit in the composition and pleasing to a degree in the representation  yet being local and at the same time merely drawn for reflections on the follies of the day their merit and claim to support cannot prevent their posting to oblivion while for years to come we shall behold pieces of inferior merit only aided by flimsy insipid mediocrity proceed with dullness and make their exit with a natural decay elizabeth canning mary squires the gipsey and miss blandy were such universal topics in      that you would have supposed it the business of mankind to talk only of them yet now in    0 ask a young man of twentyfive or thirty a question relative to these extraordinary personages and he will be puzzled to answer and will say  what mean you by enquiring  i do not understand you  the following lines from mr footes prologue of      will prove how occurences are remembered or forgotten the many various objects that amuse t is busy curious time by way of news are plys elections murders lottries jews all these comunded fly throughout the nation and set the whole in one great fermentation true brish earts the same high spirits show be they to damn a farce or fight a foe one day for liberty the briton fires the next he flames  for canning or for squires in like extremes your laughing humor flows have you not roared from pit to upper rows and all the jest was  what  a fiddlers nose the person here inended is mons cervetti engagd at drury lane many years before the trial of elizabeth canning who has been a standing joke with the uppergallery for a long time past on account of the length of his nose but as i am informed that no features of his mind are out of proportion unless it be that his good qualities are extraordinary i take this opportunity to mention that it is cruel to render him uneasy in the business in which he is eminent and by which he must get a livelihood note  footes prologue    pursue your mirth each night the joke grows stronger for as you fret the man his nose looks longer and strange to add that nosey from the use of being loudly called for in      is still retained by the galleries particularly at present in the york circuit where without compliment the leader is a man of great professional merit but has a nose as much too long as the managers is too short  the tea of mine for two or three years after i first went on the stage i judged would be an increase of lasting success although the season      when mr foot was at covent garden giving his tea proved that though a blazing comet two years before all attraction was over the wonder had ceased and no longer brought grist to his mill now let the tide be ever so strong yet those ladies or gentlemen whether favored by melpomene or thalia if they flatter themselves with thinking like alonzo  seen for ever yet for ever new will find themselves deceived and will fail in two points unless they attend to prudence and economy and by those means secure an independence which will greatly add to the continuance of fashion beyond its natural flirtation and as a weak constitution is often prolonged by strict attention to preservatives  so the performer who is secure in purse may look big and frighten the folks with a threat of  i will leave the stage  besides what a happiness it is to have a reserve against  the thousand ills that flesh is heir to   in the early part of the winter      i was brought from wandsworth to keep my birthday on the   th of october and again after christmas to see two plays then again at whitsuntide to see mrs woffington in sir harry wildair and apollo and daphne  and harlequin get into a quart bottle being the year of the bottle conjuror i complained of great severity indeed as my father and mother had been so cruel as to keep me nine months out of the twelve at school  this season was much superior to the former one at covent garden as mr quin returned from his bath retirement  mr delane and mr luke sparks from drury lane  also mrs woffington  and from dublin mrs ward and mifs bellamy who made her first appearance in belvidera  the following bill will give an idea of the company by the company of comedians  at the covent garden sir john falstaff  the part of sir john falstaff to be performed the king by mr sparks the prince of wales by mr ryan prince john by mis hipp sley westmoreland by mr oltnam northumberland by mr paget sir walter blunt by mr ridout douglas by mr anderson vernon by mr gibson worcester by mr dance brother to the late city architect he was afterward called mr love  the two carriers by mr arthur and mr dunstall francis by mr collins hill by mr bencraft lph by mr marten  by mr stoppeer sheriff by mr oats traveller by mr smith hoste by mrs bambridge lady piercy by mrs woffington and the part of hotspur to be performed boxes  s  pit  s  first gal  s  upper gal  s  no persons to be admitted behind the scenes or any money to be returned after the curtain is drawn up  places for the boxes to be taken of mr page at the stagedoor of the theater  n b these persons were then in their prime but are all since dead    when in town every morning by mr pages permission i attended the rehearsal there the desire to become an actor at only ten years of age appeared very conspicuous and will fully prove and clear an error conceived by mr churchill who was afterward convinced to the contrary that mr foot instructed me in the art of imitation which was neither truth nor within the bounds of possibility my frequent mornings admittance at the theater for two years intoxicated my brain and when i returned from that to me most luxurious treat my mind was solely employed with acting and studying plays particularly those i had seen and which had made the deepest impression i formed a mad idea thus early that i was certainly a manager of a theater and when locked up in a room i there supposed myself by turns the different persons i had observed this rehearsing frenzy increased to such a degree that at last i fitted up a room in a theatrical manner as a proof i have now several hundred of my playbills in fullsized paper wrote in red and black and could at this instant as easily tell what plays farces and pantomimes were performed at my theater in the savoy with a knowledge of all the performers whether married single old or young and what they played as if all the vision had been realized  the bills i have often produced not as a proof of my sense but insanity or theatrical influenza  the rehearsals that year were very regular at covent garden the scenes for volpone henry iv and their stock plays for at that house they seldom acted new ones or revived old ones were regularly changed  and all was awful silence  mr quin was sole monarch and had a manner most terrible to the under performers carpenters etc if he spied me within two yards of the wings  get away boy  and struck his cane with such violence as made me tremble  mrs woffington had that year left david garrick for more reasons than one  first she had before he proved a false swain lived with the charming garrick who wrote a favorite song called lovely peggy  once more i will tune the vocal shell over hills and dales my passion tell etc she was mortified at his marriage for she lost the reigning sway she expected to have had in sharing the cares of monarchy  mrs pritchards division of characters hurt her and mrs clive who was superior to fear was a constant thorn so much has been said of mrs woffington that it is needless to mention her lady townly lady betty etc  an elegant figure in breeches  she looked and acted sir harry wildair with such spirit and deportment that she gave flat contradiction to what farquhar asserted  that when wilks died sir harry wildair might go to the jubilee  and yet so far has his prophecy been fully verified no male performer even garrick or woodward succeeded but all have failed in that part she repeated it with never ceasing applause for several years her exellence when at drury lane occasioned the following joke which i do not give as new but hope it will bear the repeating  dame clive and that lady were ever at variance mrs woffington coming into the greenroom after a favorite scene in sir harry in high spirits exultingly said to mrs clive  she had got so much applause that by the living god she believed one half of the audience took her for a man  o  says clive archly  do not be uneasy as you are satisfied the other half know the contrary  the early part of this season i had been at a correct rehearsal of the careless husband  lord foppington mr cibber sir charles easy mr ryan lord morelove mr delane lady easy mrs ward lady graveairs mrs hale edging mrs ridout lady betty modish mrs woffington  after which i hastened home to repeat what i could recollect my mother observing me so particular stood at the room door to listen as she thought she heard a talking and hearing me pronounce in a strange voice  my lord foppington give me my snuff box  she after dinner desired to know what i was talking of when shut up by myself i was rather perplexed and said  i had fancied all that day i was sometimes mr cibber but oftener mrs woffington as she had acted lady betty delightfully on this she sent for the play and i studied different parts of it and also the first scene of sir john and lady brute which i had seen that winter i was then i believe very like mr quin and mrs woffington nay am certain i was as i can repeat the same at this instant in like manner a proof what force first impressions make in the days of our youth  this soon produced when i was visiting abroad or when we had company at home an entreaty for master tate to act mr quin and mrs woffington the applause of the company added fuel to the flame  drury lane theater i did not see till the season    0 and strange to tell did not wish to go there so strongly was i attached to sweet covent garden  and a something like hallowed ground to this moment occasions reverence and awe for the steps and avenues of that theater a full house at covent garden then was pleasing intelligence  the preference and success f garrick and drury lane i could not relish  this employment i pursued with unremitting slavery even to the prejudice of health  in september      i had an ague and fever which could not be conquered but kept me confined all the winter except being permitted to see three plays lady jane gray was one and to this moment i recollect quin saying in gardener i hold no speech with heretics and traitors  september    0 was the remarkable year barry and cibber joined forces with quin and woffington at covent garden as also macklin on seeing mr barry and mrs cibber lessened in my opinion the merit i had alone allowed to my first favorites mr quin and mrs woffington the run of romeo and juliet was that season when the famous controversy happened between the two houses on account of this play and which commenced at both theaters on friday the   th of september the following is an exact bill of the covent garden play by the company of comedians  at the covent garden  the part of romeo to be capulet by mr sparks montague by mr bridgewater fscalus by mr anderson benvolio by mr gibson paris by mr lacey lady capulet by mrs barrington friar laurence by mr ridout gregory by mr arthur sampson by mr collins abram by mr dunstall baltbazar by mr bransby mercutio by mr macklin tibalt by mr dyer nurse by mrs macklin and the part of juliet to be performed by mrs cibber an additional scene will be introduced representing  with an occasional prologue to be spoken  boxes  s  pit  s  first gal  s  upper gal  s  places for the boxes to be taken of mr page at the stagedoor of the theater  to begin exactly at six oclock    the first play i saw at drury lane was that year  it was the mourning bride  osmyn mr garrick zara mrs pritchard almeria miss bellamy  garrick was not in my secret opinion so enchanting as barry  miss bellamy very inferior indeed to mrs cibber  but mrs pritchards zara struck me with admiration the farce was lethe in which the characters were so inimitably performed by woodward yates shuter blakes miss minors and mrs clive that i felt actually angry at myself for being so pleased with the performers of the old house when in a comparative view with my favorites of the new i mention this as an instance of the force of obstinate and headstrong partiality whether we are young or old and am sorry to observe that conviction or reason will not conquer our prejudices as we grow old any more than prevail over the sentiments of waxen youth  the winter of    0 i saw several plays and for fear of being tainted with the prevailing powers of drury lane entered not that fashionable pace of resort the end of the season mr quin left the stage the opening play in the september following      was the recruiting officer at covent garden mrs woffingtons name was inserted for sylvia but on some sudden disagreement she went off for ireland and a mrs vincent performed the part  in october      was mr mossops and mr rosss first appearance at drury lane in the characters of richard and young bevil i passed my time as the preceding season only with this difference that i attended both theaters they closed as usual  in the autumn what i had ardently wished for two years before came to pass as my being sent to harrow school was put into real practice by my coming to the age of thirteen the ensuing  th of nov      being the year of the new style this when at a distance i thought pleasing but for a manager a critic to be sent to school was a stroke of real grief and horror my pride prevented me from owning the truth for i had sometime before petitioned for this indulgence therefore would not let my veracity or resolution be called in question  so o woeful day to harrow school i was conveyed by my mother where on seeing my friend george forbes i endeavored to compose myself and submit to slavery he introduced me to the duke of gordon and his brother lord adam gordon also at that school which was then second only to eaton in this kingdom were lord down sir john russiate and the capt divess to whom i have been much obliged but instead of the place becoming more easy by habit the manager rose strongly in my heated imagination  studying a play was the employment of a man but going to school the god of idleness convinced me was intolerable  i therefore resolved on a retreat not doubting but if i related to my mother that i had seen three boys whipped she would relent and receive me home again and soften all resentment from my father who humoured me to a greater degree than she did herself but when he was in a passion which thank god was but seldom it was dreadful to execute with wisdom and discretion such a dangerous undertaking the good the unfortunate andree used not more precaution  i waited for a public holiday and loading my pockets with oranges and gingerbread the night before got up at six in the morning and proceeded down harrowhill unfortunately not being accustomed to the road i turned to the right and every now and then looked up to spy if any one was pursuing me so strong is guilt  suspicion ever haunts the guilty mind  the thief does fear each bush an officer   having walked for some time i read on a stone one mile to partington or some such name i was alarmed and hastened back to my old ground the bottom of the hill if i looked behind and saw a man on horseback i was sure he was in pursuit of me i soon reached the fifth milestone where some men were at work on the roads here i was again puzzled by a separation of two broad carriageways and fearing a second blunder said pray good men which is the road to london why says one of them  to the left but i am afraid young gentleman you have run away from school  no indeed says i and to convince him he was wrong took the only method to prove him quite in the right by immediately taking to my heels the men laughed and cried catch him  stop him  i was truly a frightened hare after stumbling running etc at last i was obliged from sickness and great fatigue to stop but finding no pursuers in about ten minutes i continued my journey and got safe into london when advanced beyond the purlieus i stopped at a coffeehouse and breakfasted one danger being over i now began when hunger was satisfied to feel other qualms which were the approach of home i walked very slow and got to the savoy just as the bell was ringing for prayers i sauntered till it ceased well knowing that my father was then secure and for fear of mistake took a peep to be certain that he read the prayers that point being settled to my satisfaction i rapped at the door and soon with perfect ease asked my mother how she did  her surprise was great  all my relation of cruelties and whipping the little boys would not avail she expostulated on the great expense of the entrance to the masters as dr thackerey mr prior etc  said she would soften the matter as well as she could  but back i must go  i was ordered to retire and on so doing my reflections were by no means the most pleasant when commanded into the presence of my father i was conditionally pardoned but after a bit of dinner for which i had not the least appetite a chaise was ordered and a servant sent with me who was to stop the carriage at the bottom of harrow hill in order if possible that my difgrace of running away might be a secret this i was obliged to submit to and i arrived at the fatal spot like a culprit prepared for execution but when i came to the borders of the village i soon heard the warhoop of indians and perceived almost the whole school assembled and ready to tar and feather me for my flight  from many tokens of intelligence and searching enquiries i was soon discovered to have been more than merely out of bounds i therefore like a poor deserter wanted no more than handcuffs to make my appearance and contrition truly in character when like a god my friend george forbes appeared who was held in great respect and esteem drew me from my disagreeable situation and under his arm conveyed me safe to mr reevess the writing master house where i was boarded and delivered me from the hands of the philistines mr and mrs reeves were of a a genteel turn and what do you think good reader better than that  they were critics and fond of plays and what was better still mrs reevess sister then on a visit was play and romance mad but at this time of distress i was not acquainted with those delightful circumstances however they were kind not austere upon my disgrace and mr reeves interfered to prevent the deserters corporal punishment but the adventure reached the ear of admiral forbes who fearing my bad example might have an ill effect on his newphew over whom he judged i had great influence which might occasion his taking a trip over to dublin to see his mamma insisted on my being made an example of terror by way of prevention  dr thackerey was as benign and humane a man as ever was placed at the head of such an unruly community as a public school but the reverend prior loved to lift his arm up for the awful flogging better than fieldings parson thwackum and judged himself robbed of his rights when he was prevented from putting in force his love of torture he was in truth a despicable severe and disagreeable tyrant but on the hint being given while he went out of the great schoolroom i believe i might be speaking a little too loud when the head scholar ordered me to stand before the throne and am sorry to say except from my friend george forbes i perceived universal exultation for the lad that runs away is looked on like the cowardly soldier who retires on the day of battle soon entered governor prior who with exulting features ordered me to be prepared and brought immediately to the block and to strike terror desired attention to his skill on the occasion and as what must be must e i patiently resigned to my cruel fate he never acted the barbarian better  the blood did follow where the rod was driven the flesh did quiver where the birchen tore but that was foreign to the soul  not all his strokes or energetic arm could force a gran away that he might guess at   this proved in fact a most lucky adventure  as misfortunes past prove stories of delight for when school was over i was generally saluted and applauded for my heroism and from that time was on good terms with all the scholars my boardinghouse became every day more satisfactory for my fond mother to keep me easy under my bondage after such a life of indulgence as i had been accustomed to was even near in her family expenses and denied herself what was absolutely necessary in order to send tate luxuries such as tea sugar nice chickens bottles of wine pound cake etc with the playbills of the week those presents i gave to mrs reeves which occasioned an intimacy and my sitting up to supper this brought on stage conversation and from that i was asked whenever they had company to act plays so considering myself as a manager in distress the time passed tolerably pleasant till december we had only one dispute which was mr reevess pronouncing garrick not only the best actor but what was more intolerable the best romeo to which i must have yielded had not the wife declared entirely on my side of the argument and wondered her husband could make such a comparison  the sister avowed the same and they both agreed that barry was a charming man and made love like an angel to which i assented and significantly said it was not worth contending for it really was not every one that saw a play who was a perfect judge of acting  it may not be improper to observe how necessary it is to make every one a wellwisher instead of an enemy  friends are happy circumstances they are the foundationstone of human greatness from the highest to the lowest  civility is worth the preserving for if offended a star and garter may find himself hurt by the rudeness of a blackguard therefore as many friends as possible it is our interest to procure provided they can be gained without descending to meanness  a few insignificant enemies are not amiss they rouse the spirits to action and vigor while the kindness of friends and selflove are so far from improving the mental faculties that they only act on the understanding as laudanum and all real genius is lulled into lethargy and sluggishness  from my civility to mrs reevess sister i was not only made of some little consequence at harrow but the sequel will prove it led to an important part of my future life  while at mr reevess a theatrical fete was to be given before the christmas holidays in the great schoolroom as the custom had been for some years to act three nights before that period to which all the families from stanmore and the adjacent villages were invited the room was very commodious for such a purpose shapes were borrowed from mr rich who it seems always obliged the school on such occasions dr thackerey the good governor fixed on the roman father for the leading scholars to enact the first night the play was presented i was an auditor but mrs reeves and her sister were stung to the quick their pride was hurt to think their favorite boarder and such a promising actor had not a chance for fame and a share of the applause at this public time  mrs reevess sister felt herself so unhappy on this trivial matter that she waited on dr thackerey with me in her hand and requested i might reharse lord and lady townly which the doctor goodnaturedly assented to and i instantly performed lord townly alamode barry  lady townly alamode woffington which actually broke through the buckram of the college and the doctors accustomed solemnity and he and his good woman laughed very heartily for though he never saw more than three or four plays in a year and that during the christmas recess the transition of voice and manner from barry to woffington pleased the doctor so much that he actually sent for his eldest son frederick and desired him to study the first scene of lord townly and ordered it to precede the roman father the next playnight to which mr frederick like a good son acquiesced promised to be perfect bowed retired and kept his word mrs reevess sister and i returned in triumph and after congratulations of success on our embassy much consultation was necessary for the equipment and the attire of lady townly as if a matter of the utmost importance what they could not furnish me with was borrowed from their connexions in the neighborhood and with infinite pains attended to the manner and taste they were to show on the entree of the new performer  after not less than three hours in the equipment a chair which i wonder at in so small a place was to be hired to convey me to harrowtheatre and not i assure you without some emotion not that my first acting seemed distressing nor was it particular my playing lady townly as two young gentlemen of family personated horatia and valeria and as to dress my english attire as much surpassed the roman ladies on this occasion as mrs bellamys new parisdress is asserted by her to have outshone mrs woffingtons when they acted the rival queens however not having in reality played before any number of persons fit to be termed an audience it gave me a tremor natural to all young actors my performance was so much superior and so infinitely more like a theatrical one than that of the young gentlemen who acted in the roman father that i bore away the palm notwithstanding publius was represented by a lord nor is it to be wondered at as they played only from an established custom of the school therefore merely judged it a pleasing relief as by so doing for ten or twelve days they relinquished the dryer studies of greek and latin but no more likely to make a figure as actors without the possession of the god than those young persons were who are related to have acted with garrick when he was a child at litchfield for they as his playmates performed merely from civility and compliance to his will whilst we may venture to pronounce his whole soul was in agitation  the effect of my lady townly was surprising indeed so much so that every one of the audience spoke to me with marks of attention and an universal request was made the next night the last of playing that i would not only oblige them with lady townly but some other part to try my skill in contrast  for they were pleased to add that every one was delighted and those phrases are not to be wondered at as the speeches of parents and neighbors at a school play i do not imagine any one night of real success when even attended with the peunia ever gave me more exquisite pleasure  joy without measure to feel myself on such a public occasion the first mark of attention as a theatrical performer at a place of such consequence as harrow school  the request of the additional performance the ensuing playnight which had my secret and eager wishes of compliance dr thackerey not only assented to but gave his approbation i being attached to mr barrys acting fixed on the gardenscene in romeo and juliet to precede the roman father and lady townly after the play but here a difficulty started which was no less than the want of a juliet for though mr frederick thackerey had consented to be lord townly he would not submit to be my juliet this occasioned a demur but sir john russiate on hearing of the obstacle removed all inconvenience by obligingly offering himself for juliet and this mighty matter was immediately concluded and as speedily put into practice but as i did not suppose a man of quality could be so good a performer as myself i therefore managerlike taught sir john some of mrs cibbers striking manner in the particular passages  which did not a little add to my selfopinion the third night finished to the extent of my ambition  i looked talked walked and felt myself a great actor  such things were such things are and such things may be yet to come as must decide whether my play of life will end with all in the right or all in the wrong if all in the right i shall then conclude like panglos that all has been for the best  on my return to supper at mr reevess they were as proud and pleased as if their own son had met with the same approbation indeed my thanks were due to them  for this little esteem which i acquired at the school etc certainly was owing not only to their thought but they had even gone lengths beyond their situation in accomplishing a matter that required some degree of difficulty and address every one who turns over these leaves will reflect how fortunate it was for me to be boarded with a family that would condescend to humor me had i been placed in a morose boardinghouse bred up as i had been or rather not bred at all i must have led the life of a sulky negro slave  but better things thank god were in store  i cannot quit harrow for the christmas recess without recollecting that my stage success as i then termed it at that place occasioned serious reflections from the wise directors for my exhibition from the peculiarity of what i attempted was the groundwork of public conversation in the circle of harrow critics it was therefore judged truly necessary to convene a cabinet council which was directly summoned where it was agreed on mature deliberation nemine tradicente not in future to have any more plays cted by the young gentlemen at harrow school the annual custom was therefore abolished and i am told that law has been strictly adhered to from that time to this as they feared it might get the appellation of and an idle report be circulated in the world that it was a school for breeding up actors in lieu of scholars though without doubt since that period private plays having been so very fashionable many changes of opinion must have occurred for the improvement of that little state since my happy acting there in dec       but i judge had the ancient custom been revived and tolerated the newspapers or some chance intelligence would have before this fully informed me adieu to harrowhill and hey for the christmas holidays savoy and plays  i was received at home as usual with fondness and partiality even to a fault if asked a question relative to the progress i had made in my learning i quickly answered it with relating the fine play we had performed and that was sufficient but more so when i assured them i was the leading actor and father and mother were so pleased they determined tate should not be disappointed of his darling amusement i visited as soon as possible my favorite palaces of drury lane and covent garden and if money was ever so shor at home it was raised by some means no matte how difficult  i particularly recollect seeing on saturday th  0th of december the siege of damascusphocyas barry eumenes ryan caled sparks abudah ridout eudocia mrs cibber with the dances of il pastore and il morlaco by signor maranesi and signora bugiani two excellent dancers  by the bye the dances at that time were greatly supported very different from what they are at the theaters now  cook and hilliard both in a first degree were added to the maranesi and the bugiani the entertainment was apollo and daphne by command of his royal highness frederick prince of wales who seldom went to drury lane what were the reasons to have occasioned a disgust i cannot give or even guess at  had it been out of compliment to old quin who had the instruction of his present majesty in his youth it might in some measure have accounted for it as quin often exclaimed on being told that his majesty delivered his maiden speech with gracefulness and precision  ay i knew it would be so  for i taught the boy to speak but in      that cause had ceased as quin had retired in the spring      to bath and quitted the stage but the princes partiality continued  on monday january        mr smith made his first entre in the character of theodosius or the force of love  varanes barry athenais mrs cibber it was repeated the tuesday wednesday and thursday following mr smiths first benefit was on saturday april        the siege of damascus  when the drum beat for marching orders to the camp at harrow i feigned sickness very well and by continuing at home i was at the height of bliss mr and mrs reeves were on account of their civilities to me at harrow constant visitors at my fathers during the recess mr wier gentleman to sir francis delaval was smitten with my friend mrs reevess sister the lass of the hill and dr wilkinson was appointed to perform the holy rites  i was father on the occasion and gave her away  i remember it was a cheerful evening with us all and a genteel supper was ordered by sir francis delaval and so ended the marriage with the usual ceremony  my attention to the stage was truly unremitting  it was my day  my life  and it is not to be wondered at that my imitations when really produced on the stage were thought superior to mr garricks or mr footes for those particular actors and actresses whose manner and voice i so strongly presented to the public were taken on the truest ground that of feeling myself at the time the person i imitated and not exaggerated into buffoonery  and this was my work my toil my constant practice for some years before i played in london my mode was that as ideal manager i appointed myself to act lord townly now except lady townly lady grace and mr manly for i played all the parts had each a different voice and manner it did not please the buildings of my fancy unless that i had performers supposed to be under my command as thus  lord townly as mr barry going out so soon after dinner madam   lady townly as mrs woffington lard my lord what can i possibly do at home   manly as mr sparks yes madam in rather turning myself out of doors than her   lady grace as mrs elmy dont you think that would be going too far   manly as mr sparks i dont know but it might madam  for in strict justice i think she ought rather to go than i etc   a stranger on those occasions to have been at the door would have thought that four or five persons were gathered together and were rehearsing a play i had so habituated myself to this fluctuation of voice and to move and change my features to those of the actors and actresses i judged myself personating that from impulsive enthusiasm for i cannot think of another word i felt as if each individual i spoke and acted like were at that instant under the restrictions and reverence due to a real audience of the most collected and fashionable consequence and my fiction and dream of passion did work my soul up to its own conceit that from its fancy all my visage warmed my whole function uiting with forms to my conceit   when this thought is supported by an applauding audience it becomes more truly relished than an auditor or reader can suppose for the best actor that ever trod the stage as betterton booth wilks cibber quin garrick barry or kemble if not supported by encouragement would still have remained himself  not the character he represented unless happily thrown off his guard by the smiles and applause of the public which bestowed on silken wings sublime he cuts the air and is in reality the monarch he then represents the same aid the same comfort makes the comedian as well as the tragedian but not in so great a degree as circumstances differ widely  a smile only will cheer a drooping comedian but the ame smile is immediate death to the tragic hero  at the end of the season may      mrs cibber left covent garden and barry lost his juliet but son provided himself another  a miss nossiter made her first appearance in that character on wednesday the  0th of october miss bellamy returned to covent garden but her first appearance was very different from what she relates in her memoirs  i will put a stop for the present to theatrical anecdotes as well as of my family and self and must here entreat leave to introduce a little history of  lady cornwalliss father  a year before its real date that it may not intervene too much with that part of my life which on reflection from that hour to my last will be truly interesting to my feelings and i doubt not but it will claim and obtain the tear of pity amongst the variety of our acquaintance and visitors my mothers most constant intimate was a mrs jones wife of captain james jones of his majestys third regiment of guards who lived in the house allotted for the superintendant officer in the savoysquare and not above two hundred yards from ou dwelling as a private family history this tale might be thought intruding tiresome and impertinent but when i announce capt james jones as the father of the late lady cornwallis i hope i shall be permitted to proceed and be honored with attention nor will his lordship i trust be offended with any matter i shall here insert for i pronounce that it is the pen of truth which writes this relation of all my various and historical events and i would rather burn the book than let it be stained with slander what i here respectfully and with diffidence relate i assure myself his lordship will not  cannot be offended at but the contrary  cursed be the lines however so well they flow if they but make one single man my foe   at the time i give this short detail of change and chances in lifes ickle dance i must notice i have been for many years thrown so distant from my ancient friends and patrons and my visits of late when in london were so limited that i know not whether mrs jones motherinlaw to lord cornwallis is living or dead however if that good lady is now in our earthly region i take the liberty to mention that the material part such as the grand change in captain joness latter fortune i had from her own lips or rather my mother was honored with the relation  captain jones was of a most accomplished turn of mind to which was added every requisite to constitute the true gentleman  a strong understanding wit vivacity and generosity his person well made smart elegant but not handsome i cannot ascertain capt jones and his ladys mode and manners better than by referring the reader o fieldings capt booth and his amelia i could suppose mrs jones the amelia in every respect and have my doubts whether fielding did not take exact measure and actually founded that novel on his knowledge of those two persons  nay i could almost swear it for i never can believe that captain jones and his lady would have been so very complaisant as to have studied their very foibles and rush into scenes of distress merely to imitate characters drawn by a novelist  to these worthy persons the world was obliged for a son and daughter  the son mr james jones is still living near whitehaven his estate being in that part of the kingdom miss jones the daughter was when a child of a remarkably quick genius and possessed a theatrical turn at eight years old could repeat all the speeches of juliet with the utmost precision and her fathers judgment and attention made her quite correct but dame fortune will have her frolics and like a naughty woman makes no scruple of introducing her daughter miss on every occasion  nay so abandoned is she that she forces her into the worst as well as the best company and what is truly lamentable no living mortal will ever hear of her death for the wicked jade will live and triumph while the world is a world and she too often from her whims by being an universal plague obliged captain jones to make the verge of the court his most frequented walks  and of course being often weary in body and mind in such walks of recreation and the reflections on this noon lounge he would frequently sit down in a reverie on one of the benches in st jamess park mrs chance not her daughter met him one morning and suggested his resting himself on the same bench with general skeleton who was then an entire stranger to him of an ill tempered morose turn like old rueful in the natural son this happened often and by these interviews and chit chat they of course became mutually acquainted as parkfrequenters to create an appetite for dinner but no more for the general never once asked him to his house or formed any further intercourse in the variety of ups and downs which capt joness spirit and humor occasioned that hydraheaded monster gaming the origin of most human ills precipitately urged him to the brink of ruin his affairs grew so embarrassed that he found it necessary to have a secret retirement about eight miles from the metropolis near mortlake upon the thames and by art and disguise he found means to see his family some time elapsed when after a long absence he was obliged to appear at st jamess  being in a hurry to reach that place of royal protection fearing every instant a rude fisted bailiff he was posting with the eyes of argus to get within the sacred verge when he was suddenly called on by an audible voice which he took to be that of an acquaintance he did not wish to be near therefore made the best of his way the other continuing in full speed after our captain fear did not add wings on this occasion for he looked on this fatal demon as one that would so far prove a devil as to plunge him into ruin and irretrieveable distress finding it impossible to gain the wished for asylum he determined to face his enemy and wheeled about as in a posture of defense  this short pause soon brought the parties to a state of parley jones on looking steadfastly on his supposed enemy knew him to be a gentleman of the law and of reputation therefore said what is the reason sir you hazard my resentment by treating me in this rude and contemptible manner  why says the lawyer damn it jemmy what are you afraid of  i am mr brown the ttorney and have had the pleasure of knowing you for some time  true said the captain but you are not at present one of the most pleasant acquaintance i could wish to meet in my present circumstances  mr brown dear jones you never were in a greater error for before we part i will make you confess i am not only equal but superior to any friend you ever had in your life   captain jones indeed   mr brown i will prove my assertion therefore without apprehension or surprise let you and i adjourn to the next tavern and the mystery shall be made perfectly clear   the reader cannot doubt but on this mixture of alarm doubt fear and apprehension joness heart beat as quickly from curiosity as it had within a short space done with fear in silence they entered the first house of public invitation that offered  having procured a room etc after three or four hems stirring the fire and the lawyer guessing at the others eagerness he for once in his life omitted the laws delay and proceeded to business  brown my dear sir to ease your suspense and bring the extraordinary cause of our meeting to that conclusion which tends to promote the success and happiness of your life there is an unknown friend anxious for your prosperity and for the welfare of your worthy wife and family therefore let me know the amount that will make your affairs easy and i have authority to assure you it shall be immediately done   jones i declare sir  here his features brightened  it is a surprising as well as unexpected proposal but as i have dipped into fatal debts of honor which i cannot as a gentleman screen i fear when they are known i shall forfeit all the noble intentions of my concealed patron   brown fear not even that for your patrons scrutinizing eye has made him well acquainted with every part of your misconduct as well as your nobler and deserving qualities and the latter in his judgment weighs so much superior as to kick the beam with your errors and i feel the happiness at this instant to have it in my power to convince you that you may be free from all terror or inconvenience during life   jones good god who can this paragon of friendship be  or am i in a dream   brown term it a dream  and though a very pleasing one you shall wake to the reality  but now let me inform you  that general skeleton has done you this favor   jones general skeleton  why except my chance meetings and conversations in the park i have little or no acquaintance with him   brown however it is true   jones let me fly this instant to the general to express my rapture acknowledgments and gratitude   brown not so fast captain  the general will never speak to you again   jones good god this is more incomprehensible than all the rest   brown not at all strange as he died last night   jones last night it is a romance  an arabian tale   brown ay or a mother shiptons prophecy and it needs not only your credibility but more  all the fortitude reason and philosophy you can summon to your aid for you must of necessity comply with not a request only but a demand   jones i hope after this act of unexpected generosity no tie is annexed to expect any compliance that may be a disgrace and oblige me to refuse the benevolence he has honored me with   brown of that you must be the judge and to be plain he had taken a great dislike to the name of jones and has ordered you to change it   jones if that be all i will consent to be called any name he may have pleased to appoint or that may have struck his fancy  but as jones is my real name i must be obliged in all transactions to retain it still   brown even that may be settled without difficulty as acts of parliament can remove greater obstacles and as you have borne the first surprise like a soldier know my dear friend i made his will and have for some time known the generals secret intentions and with sincere pleasure congratulate you on being truly and bona side left sole heir to all his ample possessions only in return as he had not a son that you by authority resign the name of jones for skeleton   here the joy the rapture of our captain may be imagined much easier than expressed yet what follows will too fully prove how transitory are all human events and the extraordinary fact plead with the feeling heart a sufficient excuse for my insertion of it  jones immediately with his good genius the honest attorney hastened to mrs jones and after the forms of necessary preparation informed her of the glad tidings  the fortunate captain and his lady went with brown to view the new palace in henrietta street from which place her impatience made her elope to see her friend mrs wilkinson in little bedfordstreet to inform her of these wonderful and delightful particulars  miss chudleigh the late duchess of kingston at that time a toast in the fashionable circles and who absolutely appeared as a naked venus at a masquerade given some years since at somersethouse was a near relation of general skeltons being apprized of his death she immediately ordered her carriage and entered the house  secure in her sanguine expectations that not only part but the whole of his estates were left at her will and disposal when the time came for the usual form of opening the will and jones was pronounced sole executor the disappointment of miss chudleigh burst out in terms exceeding all bounds of delicacy  her rage was excessive  and indeed few would be found who would rejoice at the good fortune of another when opposed to their own loss of election in short unless being too violent from extreme of passion her feelings must be allowed as the result of nature  she ironically declared the general was an old fool and in his dotage and that jones and his wife were impudent low upstarts beneath her notice  returned to her coach with a scornful quality toss and was drove furiously home to sigh fume and fret at leisure  this was the exit of that ambitious haughty dame  here with pleasure we behold after the storms of adversity a serene sky and this accomplished amiable couple surrounded with every prospect of unbounded happiness and promised addition of joys even as their days did grow with a son and daughter possessed of every endowment to make their mutual felicity complete  the house in henriettastreet after the solemn and respectful interment of general skeleton was soon new decked they remained there till the summer had made some approach it was then judged necessary on account of business pleasure and inclination to visit his estates left by the general in cumberland the son was at school and the captain his lady and daughter set off with that kind of selfsatisfaction which such a journey would naturally inspire they safely arrived and for about three weeks seemed not only in an enchanted spot but a paradise and o delightful that paradise their own unfortunately the captain wilfully and against the persuasion of his friends would be let down to view a leadmine from which indeed he did return but was instantaneously seized with a disorder of the most malignant and fatal kind which in a few days baffled all skill and he died in the arms of as sensible and endearing a wife as ever blessed a husband or honored the world her feelings on this occasion were poignant indeed but by degrees her strength of mind rose superior to her grief  her loss was great and irrevocable fate had signed the warrant and the dreadful stroke had been sustained she curbed the sudden throbs and impulse of her heart  nature had claimed her rights and she had been obeyed mrs jones reflected that though she had lost her husband her protector yet not many months before had this melancholy event happened in her book of fate she had been left destitute without friends or means of support and that a son and daughter who would now attain rank and affluence would then have been obliged to submit for their existence to means below their birth talents and education  mrs joness first cares were employed in the further improvement of her daughters education adding every accomplishment of art to those blessings nature had bestowed with a profuse and bountiful hand on her darling child a few years completed the pleasing task when the mother introduced her bewitching and attractive daughter under her matron ing into the more elegant and polished scenes of life mrs jones was of a most lively and entertaining disposition when once more returned to mix with the world she was willingly visited by the gay the good and the great amongst her round of acquaintance was the brave the present lord cornwallis he soon felt an impression not to be effaced by the frequent conversations he had the happiness to enjoy with the lovely miss jones nor was the young lady less pleased with the great attention his lordship honored her with his lordship made proposals which the mothers good sense approved and her daughters inclination and duty obeyed their souls were congenial  and to his valor and his valiant parts did she her soul and body consecrate   the match soon took place to the joy and credit of all parties never did wedded felicity promise more lasting happiness  one day past by and nothing saw but love another came and still twas only love the suns were wearied out with looking on and he untired with loving he saw her every day and all the day and every day was still but as the first so eager was he still to see her more   when lo the dreadful the unfortunate war with america appeared and to her ladyship indeed a view of horror his lordship though all the lover and affectionate husband would not suffer his honor to forget that he was a soldier and eager to hazard blood and life for his king and country he entreated not to be an idle spectator in the time of danger if his services could be rendered acceptable which was immediately granted and his majesty conferred particular command and honors on his lordship  whose regiment was ordered into immediate service lady cornwallis struck deep with grief urged every plea that affection reason entreaty and endearment could suggest to win his lordship from his purpose but there he proved inexorable  he was indeed a hector but she could not sustain the difficult firmness of an andromache she even ventured to try her influence over an high personage a near relation of his lordships the a  b  p of c  t  rb  y  who moved with her heartfelt affliction begged her to be comforted with every assurance to accomplish if practicable lord cornwalliss continued residence in england this exalted person waited on the king and painted her ladyships agony in such terms that his majesty could not refuse a request to such an incontestible proof of connubial love and relinquished his intentions of lord cornwalliss going to america her ladyship now felt secure of all her wishes but how vain how unsubstantial is human bliss  for the instant he heard an item of what was done and the source from whence it sprung e flew like lightning to the throne judged his honor duty was at stake and his fame would be for ever tarnished should he suffer such a weak womanish motive however affectionate to over balance superior duty his majesty was convinced of the propriety and nobleness of his sentiments and therefore his command was continued  to america he went  as to the hour of separation turn your light inward  eye behold and picture  he relied on her ladyships strength of mind and pride for his honor to reconcile her poignancy of sorrow  but love almighty love reigned in her distracted bosom  with horror she sunk beneath the weight of grief  her eager heart followed her other self  over leaped its bounds  and beckoned by the attending spirit her soul departed to the angels sure and left her precious image deeply engraven in his lordships heart  here let me pause and with truth declare i could not relate this tragical event of the lady by me so well remembered without paying the tribute of a tear to her lovely and virtuous memory here arises an awful and an useful lesson for reflection as it evinces that no rank whatever is exempt from misfortunes  the gilded carriage too often carries a heavy mind within  where we have feared death we have borne life away and where we would be safe we perish  since i wrote the foregoing history i have been honored with a letter from james jones skeleton esquire of pap castle near cockermouth in cumberland son to the capt jones before mentioned  i conjecture pap castle to have been the eat of good old general skeleton  the season at covent garden in

have merely given a place to fill up the chasm of my life from christmas      nor would i have offered these notes here as i intend a regular account of the success of every performer their seasons etc in a publication that will not only contain much information but be of real service to every young candidate for the sock or buskin whether lady or gentleman with the terms advantages and disadvantages of all the principal play houses and circuits in the three kingdoms and the particulars of my own theaters from my commencing manager to the present date but without any idea of another subscription therefore this little sketch is only done by way of supply for my sameness of life till november      being entirely at home  in      my father began the dreadful experiment of exerting his supposed rights as minister o the savoy and my constant attendance at the theaters was aided by a pocket full of money for soon after the fatal marriage act as i man truly term it took place my father judged h had a right to grant licenses as usual and that i was a privilege annexed to the savoy as bein extraparochial those marriages brought in profusion of cash  and instead of thinking of a rainy day all was rat tat tat at the streetdoor and a variety of company  mr foxs popularity was then arrived at such an height from the opposition he made to the marriage act that his chariot was dragged along the streets by the populace for several days together  i have known as much crowding to hear my father preach a condemned sermon as to get admittance on a fashionable night into a theater  the famous doctor killigrew who had been many years minister of the savoy and all my fathers predecessors had ever retained the power and right of granting licenses for marrying from their own authority and being extraparochial my father judged himself secure and not within the reach of that severe act the temple of hymen being so seasonably opened for the relief of distressed lovers marriage begot marriage  easter day was crowded from eight till twelve  so many pairs were for the indissoluble knot being tied that he might have made a fortune had he been blessed with patience and prudence and been contented with publishing the bans of marriage only many persons came on a sunday out of curiosity to hear such a long list of spinsters announced all females of spirit engaging for the public good the parisian dames were not less fearless on their late march to versailles had he stuck to the bans only he had puzzled the minister who framed the act  and  wisely and slow they stumble that run fast might have been my fathers motto debts that had been the plague of our house were now almost unknown and i must say in justice to government from my own knowledge he had hints of the terrible consequences that would certainly ensue and they wished him to drop a practice that must inevitably end in unavoidable ruin he supposed those hints proceeded from their fears of his undoubted right and that was the real cause of their lenity without keeping in mind that had it been so  might will overcome right  so it proved for the laws were put into immediate execution  there was then and i suppose there is still a regular walk over the leads at the savoy through the kitchen of the prison to a private door into the chapel where the condemned deserters were taken to hear service the sunday before they were to be shot and that road he took for the purpose of evading the kings messengers supposed to be at times on the watch one fatal sunday morning a sudden alarm came that the officers were in the church  a general panic ensued in our little family  my father sent word he was suddenly taken ill  nay actually wanted me to read prayers in the clerks desk and fearing that a forcible attack would be made on our territories from the the said gentlemen not meeting him in the church he went down the garden to a gate that opned on the banks of the thames the tide happened to be low  his person unluckily was weighty and he was aged about fiftyfour  the stes were old  his foot slipped and he fell very eavily against some logs of wood such as are frequently seen floating on that river he recovered himself and kept close to the shore which as very muddy and not public till he got to somersetstairs and there he immediately took a boat and by one maneuver or another got into kent for had he been seized he must not only have suffered immediate confinement but our marriage temple would inevitably have been at an end therefore in kent he engaged one mr grierson a clergyman to perform the marriages as his curate but the licenses he granted himself thinking that mr grierson could not suffer for what he in his authority as minister of the savoy was to be responsible for but he was again in error i must here take occasion to observe that those marriages were not privately conducted as through fear but quite the contrary for my father publicly advertised his authority for so doing  mr vernon of drury lane theater was at that time married by mr grierson to miss poitier of the same stage and this circumstance has occasioned a thousand ill founded stories  we all know stories beget stories but then we make em and when made we tell em  mr vernon was banished the stage by the audience in london as an informer in september      the fact was simply this  mr david garrick ever loved to be meddling and though the marriage act concerned him not half so much as  whether the emperor of moroccos sultana was the daughter of an irish oyster woman or not  yet still he would be busy  mr george garrick attorney at law his brother had wedded a daughter of mr carringtons the kings messenger and lived at somerset house on hearing of mr vernons being married he mr george garrick judged it a glorious opportunity to prove his vigilance and mr carringtons diligence in the service of government therefore they summoned mr vernon to appear and to give king david a satisfactory account of his marriage as to the where and the when for as to the tale of vernons being immediately after marriage tired of his lady it is merely a fictitious story  consent if mutual saves the lawyers fee consent is law enough to set you free  infidelity was so demonstrative on both sides that the archbishops license would have had very l tle force in tying faster the marriage noose  the lady liked a variety of husbands and the gentleman a plurality of wives they frequently changed their mates till at last in dublin he became acquainted with miss macartney who was wellbred sensible and handsome she fixed the rambling rover and with that amiable woman he lived happily till death robbed the public of one at least of the most pleasing singers the stage or vauxhall could ever boast of  he had a great advantage added to his taste and expression as a singer as he possessed what seldom accompanies vocal performers strong abilities as an actor which aided by a pleasing person gave united force to his performances on every occasion mr vernons assertion as to his being really married at the savoy to miss poitier mr david garrick affected not to believe but asked who married them  if it was doctor wilkinson mr vernon replied no  the clergymans name was grierson  mr david garrick still seemed not convinced but insisted on seeing the certificate which mr vernon immediately obtained from mr grierson and gave it to mr david garrick who delivered it to mr carrington and mr grierson was in consequence forced out of his lodgings in open day and committed to newgate tried and condemned to transportation for fourteen years  mr vernon was subpoened to the trial and was obliged to appear when called on mr grierson had a iarge family in great want of subsistence  had no living and nothing but the name of a poor clergyman for his support in circumstances so desperate he was glad to lay hold of any decent means for their support and if the worst came to the worst and the law should make a clergymans joining people in wedlock a crime which for ages had been a ceremony held in the first estimation in the minds of men why he would reconcile himself to the consequence well knowing that whatever land he should be thrown upon it could not be worse than this after he was sentenced a subscription was raised but i have been informed he died on the voyage  his family were with him but my knowledge of him was so trifling never having seen him except in those few months that he was engaged as the marrying clergyman at the savoy that it is not likely i should be fully acquainted with particulars relative to that unfortunate clergyman  my father in the intervening space supplied by grierson had so arranged his matters as in his opinion would carry all before the wind it was not four weeks before he returned home mr brooks was his attorney and the reverend mr brooks brother to the attorney who lately died at norwich was my fathers curate for the public duties of the church he was husband to mrs brooks the authoress who favored the world with rosina marian etc a perpetual round of company went on but the family strongpurse was waining into a sudden decay with feasting the counselors and lawyers who were to support his cause and one and all assured him over the flowing bowl that victory was certain  but the event of war no mortal knows mr brooks being my fathers officiate an acquaintance with his family naturally occurred mrs brooks was his second wife  her mind was good but her person much the contrary  she then had a literary turn and her agreeable sensible remarks observations and instructions were given with affability and proved to me of great advantage  at her house i frequently met with mr quin who was using his interest with mr rich to produce mrs brookss tragedy of virginia which was very properly rejected as it was not only a very poor play but one on the same subject by crofts at drury lane and another by moncrief at covent garden had been performed in      and      and neither of them attended with success but croftss was by much the best  mrs woffington and mrs elmy were also her visitors mrs elmy knowing my inclination for the stage corrected many of my faults her understanding was allowed by all to be very extensive she is still living and now must be greatly in the vale of years and i beg leave to assure her that wheresoever she dwells i have not forgot her lessons on pronunciation manners and characters nor can her merit in octavia lady grace or mrs marwood be ever erazed from my mind mrs cholmondley sister to mrs woffington was often there but hearing i had dared at that time to imitate mrs woffington mrs brooks never had influence to get me into any degree of favor with either of those ladies i twice or thrice visited mrs woffington in yorkbuildings with dr and mrs brooks but it was a forced civility in compliance to them  mrs woffington had conceived a disgust not to be removed and it was rooted even to hatred as will hereafter appear it must be observed that thirty years ago mimicking of the performers had not been attempted at the theaters except by mr garrick and that when he was at goodmans fields and by mr foot at the haymarket for when mr foot acted at covent garden he left out that part of his performance and the haymarket was the spot for him to be the hero of each tale and where he shone in a conspicuous light to every advantage his mimickry at covent garden consisted of a whimsical teaching of stage pupils the puppets  the chevalier tailor and a doctor heberden two very public characters and well known by every body  i was the first that ever gave an entertainment of that kind at drury lane or covent garden theaters since which it has been so often well and ill attempted that though the actors and actresses naturally do not approve of the practice nor admire the talents of such an exhibitor yet it does not by any means create the spleen and unhappiness it did formerly for the frequent exertion of such comic powers certainly have taken off that edge which thirty years ago was judged most cutting and not to be endured the peculiarities of mr delane an actor of the first rank were so severely pointed out by mr garrick in the character of bays that it is said to have actually occasioned mr delanes flying to the bottle for relief to his hurt mind he continued to use it with such excess that he never was himself again in other men we faults can spy and blame the mote that dims their eye each little speck and blemish find to our own stronger errors blind mr delane is mentioned as a gentleman of family in ireland of liberal education and great qualifications for the stage  mr garrick at the solicitation of his friends  remonstrances of the actors without whose assistance he could not live for what avails a general without an army and from full conviction his own merit required not such aid as mimickry as it was merely a trifling feather in his cap of fame he for once in his life did a generous action and gave up what he no longer wanted  but to return again to my father who was at home fairing most sumptuously every day on the gleanings of the marriage harvest but with very little attention or anxiety paid to the evil hour and i was in my glory full of feasting company personating a hero at night in my own playhouse or visiting one of the theaters and sometimes both if i did reflect it was very briefly  i argued thus that if the worst should happen i could be a great aor in time and did not doubt but that i should be a manager in reality  o glorious thought i did enjoy it though but in fancy but after sunshine comes a storm   my father having persisted in the pursuit of his golden vision and being of an intrepid spirit and as he thought secure of victory on the day of trial the week previous to it in july      he visited several of his friends and on the sunday evening attended by two or three of his intimates took an affectionate leave of my mother and myself and delivered himself up at newgate as he had given notice that he was ready to abide trial the next sessions which was to begin on the monday following and on the friday in the same week came on his dreadful day  a dreadful day indeed was it to my disconsolate mother whose features indicated a mind replete with woe the trial of my father was not a scene for me to be present at but i remember to have heard he urged in his defense that he had been pursued with unrelenting vengeance  as he was chaplain to his majesty had they been determined on no other act of severity they certainly for his hostile demeanor in defiance of government would have taken his place of chaplain from him however it is too well known whatever he might think as to his rights and privileges that the court found him guilty of the offense and it is as well known that though the public at large wished him well and detested the act in force yet most of his reasonable friends thought he would at last suffer the consequences announced by law by which he was sentenced to fourteen years transportation  this was a stroke he most severely felt for it struck at his affections his pride and his false dependence which was the most mortifying of all for the condolence of what we suffer from consequent effects and causes clears in some degree the rugged paths of misfortune but what our own wisdom fails in when in opposition to the opinion of wiser heads makes the disappointment terribly mortifying  and distressing indeed  the general or admiral who on a great undertaking does not prove victor however able in judgment and valor seldom or ever escapes censure my father therefore fell an unfortunate victim to the memorable marriage act his purse was drained to the last for the purchase of being promisecrammed by the alluring and flattering hopes given him by the gentlemen of the law  it now became an act of necessity for the public and his friends to be stretched to the extent of their humanity to equip and support him as a gentleman for his voyage to america his connections were considerable consequently his recommendations were such as would doubtless have placed him in a light of admiration as a man of the gospel had he arrived and lived in that country his qualifications as a scholar and as an orator with the extraordinary law that had occasioned his removal there must in all probability have made amends for his sufferings and ave raised him to the highest estimation it was after some consultation determined as soon as he was well and happily situated in america that my mother and myself should go after him  the following petition which i now present to the reader from his own hand writing was delivered by my mother herself to his majesty king george the second but without effect or notice the secretary of state would not assist  petitions were hackneyed then as now and deemed troublesome intrusions on the time of a politician  it is seldom the fortified breastwork of the minister is the friend of affliction and where pale poverty is the supplicant i fear too often his heart is callous and proof against every attack that may e attempted by the feeble efforts of mercy or charity therefore to trace entrance there for a needles point to pierce its feelings is barely possible to the kings most excellent majesty the humble petition of john wilkinson most humbly shows that so long since as the year      your petitioner has been minister of your majestys royal precinct of the savoy  that your petitioner always apprehending and believing the savoy to be a royal exempt and as such not subject to the ordinary of the diocese so he has occasionally during the time of his being minister of the savoy solemnized marriages in the chapel there by virtue of his own licenses  that in the   th year of your majestys reign an act was passed to prevent clandestine marriages it enacts  that if any person shall solemnize marriages without publication of bans unless license of marriage be first had and obtained from some person or persons having authority to grant the same every person knowingly and wilfully so offending shall be deemed and adjudged to be guity of felony and be subject to be transported for fourteen years  that your majestys petitioner from the hopes that his mistake was not criminal voluntarily surrendered himself to take his trial upon a charge of having acted against that statute but having been convicted at the last sessions is liable to be transported for the term of fourteen years and by this conviction has been deprived of that office in the savoy and his wife and family thereby now in the utmost distress  that your majestys petitioner as he innocently pursued the example of his predecessors so from your majestys paternal goodness he humbly supplicates your majestys pardon to prevent a clergyman of the church of england who for more than thirty years has enjoyed other preferments in the church from being banished his native country and who has been universally confessed to be a faithful loyal and useful subject  and your majestys petitioner as in duty bound shall ever pray john wilkinson     the time for his departure was early in march      and the last meeting between father mother and son was in that most dreadful of all places newgate we who had for so many years moved in a different sphere and who were more than commonly united  a description of it must here be omitted but if the sensible feeling mind will take a short pause and honor the ashes of the dead with a moments reflection and a tear of pity it will be only paying a tribute due to humanity and mercy and from whence ideas will flow in painting the result of such a tragical affecting scene as imagination will easily describe much stronger than any words can possibly express for apelles when he placed his hero in an agony of grief cast a mantle over his face thereby indicating that strong passions were more naturally supplied from the glow of ideas than from the pencil of the artist however fine or excellent  my dear benevolent indulgent gracious and loving parent farewell may your last blessing procure me at least a small portion of your wishes for my short remains of life  my father with every comfortable necessary as a gentleman  all his valuables clothes his writings his bureau cash with recommendatory letters etc set sail for america but was previously obliged to pay thirty pounds as a perquisite for freedom  a tax on misfortune  as a tribute to the hungry commanders of such vessels but it seemed as if the almighty arm had purposely interfered to prevent the disgrace of any one of his holy servants here on earth landing as a banished criminal in a foreign clime for only performing that ceremony instituted in his holy writ as a sacred band of unity between those whom inclination had led to his sacred altar therein obeying the impulse of nature ordained and sancted by god himself  when they reached the downs they could not proceed the winds would not permit them from thence we received a letter containing an account of my father being but very indifferent as the gout had made a severe attack in his stomach a complaint with which he was every year more or less afflicted in that dangerous seat of its residence they were driven by stress of weather into plymouth where his enemy the gout assisted by the severity of the elements seized this dreadful opportunity to league with death and volently assaulted a mind and body already lded with anguish affection and affliction and by finding himself bereft of that assistance and tenderness from those he sighed for but sighed in in  the merciless invaders proved too mighty for his fortitude  the noble cordage cracked and broke grim death sat triumphant over his conquered manes  then my fathers soul might smilingly exult after all his sufferings here on earth and as  to his god rejoicingly cry out o death where is thy sting  o grave where is thy victory  before the end of this tragical story i must relate that the captain of the vessel had my father privately interred at plymouth from whence as fatality seemed to pervade the whole mysterious event on the captains returning to his ship his boat was overset by a rough sea the crew were saved but the captain perished with one winters brush thus was i left open bare for every storm that blowed  me to bear that  who never knew but better  was some burden   when the marriage act took place in      the duchy of the savoy certainly was in a lawless state as acts of parliament have passed within these fifteen years to put it under the power of government i recollect several instances  two will explain as well as five hundred from the savoysteps in the strand on to duchylane which is the last turning before you come to somerset house down to the waterside and next the water on to somersetstairs that used to be for watermen is all the savoy precincts i remember that a mr wood a timbermerchant purchased the house next door to ours near the savoy watergate and placed in it one pugh who belonged to covent garden theater to take care of it but wood neglecting at the time to put furniture into the premises when he wood wanted his house pugh not only refused but kept possession of it for himself and wood could not get any remedy at law the reason i do suppose was that no original right could be proved by him pugh after living in this house for some years sold it to one meredith a welchman and taffy well knowing how to turn the penny even stripped the lead off the roof of the house which he afterward covered with boards and arred them over the lead i believe was the property of government for it reached over that a part of my fathers house and some of the savoy prison  a man whose name was waller kept a public house near the savoysquare he heard of a house being empty next the savoy watergate where mrs porter a celebrated actress in cibbers time had lived the house had been left and stripped of all the furniture  breaking a lock was a service of danger therefore this waller who kept the suttlinghouse near the barracks with a ladder fixed against it from a lighter mounted and got in with ease at the old balcony and by the same means in the might conveyed chairs etc into the house took off the lock on the inside and became so dexterous thereby as to be firmy established in the possession of it  for while furniture was in the house and that furniture his the house was also his property as long as he dwelt in it or had his goods there  such was the unruly state of the savoy  waller was still more lucky  for one burdet a very rich old german i dare say near eighty years of age who walked the streets in rags and was a picture of misery equal to otways witch for his eyes with burning rheum were scald and red and went about picking up dry sticks and mumbling  would not allow himself the necessaries of life  was filthy in every sense of the word this man purchased for a very trifling sum of money this same house of waller and which the old man expected to sell for a good round sum in comparison to what he had given but first he had placed in it a broken bedstead  chair etc more luxuries he needed not as the cold earth was often his bed and water his draugh of refreshment  he had been missing for several days at la waller was the lucky man to obtain the house once more for after repeated rappings at the door he burst it open and found this old unaccountabl character this poor good miserable extraordinar being for though he grudged himself food and rament yet he ad a heart open to anothers misery i have known him do great acts of kindness for m father laying dead and by appearance had been so for some days and in all probability for want of common cheer and a little assistance now waller was so lucky by this accident as again to become the possessor and the house since that time about      went gradually down from tenant to tenant according to the savoy law and was burnt to the ground the very week before i went to london in the summer       the house above it which i mentioned before as having fallen into the hands of one meredith suffered by the conflagration all the large shops in the strand from the surry steps to somersetgate were all sold or taken by surprise time out of mind any old person in that district will confirm what i relate as the words of truth though they may seem bordering on the mavelous  the melancholy account of my fathers death was soon conveyed to us and was submitted to with resignation then to think of means for subsistence for my afflicted mother and myself no restoration of the effects which my father died possessed off could ever be had as the following lines in a letter some time after from my mother so long as january      will elucidate   hearing the vessel was returned from america  i sent mr philips a clerk of your fathers to the captain of the ship who was astonished at the demand upon him for effects which he plainly demonstrated to be left in maryland  this enquiry cost me ten shillings and sixpence  all i can now do is to get a letter conveyed to the merchants abroad to undertake a restitution  which application ended in fruitless and additional expense   yet in this destitute forlorn and miserable state was she left to support and maintain not only herself but me it was in the time of the war with france  captain jones immediately offered to procure me a commission in the army  lord forbes the same but my own wise head led to higher views  no less than monarchy itself in short the stage was my throne of adulation i therefore rejected their offers which to my mother gave a heart felt pang as we were really reduced to live by the sale of such articles of remaining luxury as could produce subsistence and which enabled us to continue an appearance fit to be received at those tables we were invited to and here let me remark that a lord may dine in a dingy dress and it is genteel fashionable and elegant but let the needy man set down to table and a lord by chance should come into the room the master and mistress of the ceremony do not know how to help or look at the poor guest for fear of disgracing themselves yet at the same time wish to convey an idea to every one present that they are amiable and beneficent and that really they have put themselves out of their way in order to support the pauper by giving him a meal  my mothers friends were capable and willing to afford every support to enable her to keep up a decent appearance both at home and abroad by a respectable assistance which when so bestowed will ever gladden the oppressed mind but not when offered as a supercilious gift  as who should say i am sir oracle  how good i am lear  take physic pomp  expose thyself to feel what wretches feel  that thou may cast the superflux to them  and show the heavens more just    these kindnesses assisted by our false crippled friend hope who leads astray the old the young the gay the lively the rich and the poor with her delusions lulled us for a while into a stupid lethargy at length we were suddenly aroused by its being seriously pointed out by mr jonas hanway and others that they could not help being angry that a lad between seventeen and eighteen not bred to any business and whose education had been shamefully neglected should by his having been accustomed to indulge his own selfwill and pleasure refuse to receive a commission especially as i ought to have rejoiced and have been ready to have accepted of a genteel competency instead of idly preferring hanging on a mother for subsistence who was herself dependent on others for her support these hints to a young selfconceited mind are always received by such unfortunate pets as the effects of insolent authority and impertinence  as i had not then actually experienced the rod of affliction or necessity i did not or would not perceive the rapid strides i was taking for my destruction there are many situations such as conway sands lincoln marsh etc where on a summers eve it may be pleasant to walk and view the prospects round but if thoughtlessly the proper time for returning is neglected  what had the minute before appeared pleasing and delightful is surrounded with water  ingulfed and swallowed up reflection then comes too late  this is exemplified by a passage in king john  for in a night the best part of my power  as i upon advantage did remove  were in the washes all unwarily  devoured by the unexpected flood   from my then situation may youths take a lesson and  learn to be wise from others harm  and they will do full well   though i had not seemingly attended to mr jonas hanways authoritative lecture and remonstrance yet conviction inwardly and sullenly told me that something must be done the stage my thoughts had not forgot though i dared not avow my inclination for it fearing my patrons and mother would not prefer my being a player to that of an officer and what i dreaded still more was my hearing a mean opinion delivered of my education and want of capability as a servant of the muses however unknown to them i plucked up courage and waited on mr rich and after rehearsing several speeches from richard iii he behaved very familiarly and desired me to hear him act richard iii and his acting over i was without loss of time enrolled on the list of his pupils after some time he taught me a trumpery speech for to make my appearance as one of the three ambassadors in the humourous lieutenant but after the honor of attending his levees having free admission behind the scenes and receiving a few lessons from him he  my astonishment declared i was incapable of becoming an actor but whether the fault lay in the preceptor or in the stupidity of the pupil is difficult to determine but so it was  and my only consolation was constantly attending behind the scenes where i by mere accident grew familiarly acquainted with mr shuter the only one who took the least notice of me  i lived on hopes however that mr rich would ere long perceive my genius which i assured myself was beyond compare and soon after on my repeating the first speech of richard iii one morning in the exact tone and manner of old rich he seemed delighted and i judged all would soon terminate in the accomplishment of my wishes but the following odd accident frustrated all my hopes and i innocently incurred the fixed displeasure of mr rich  my ideal opinion of greatness ouzed away and what sense i had formerly possessed was now returning with a melancholy prospect before me  even that of existence stared at me with an aspect that struck with every mortifying and humiliating sensation this total overthrow to all my expectations was occasioned by mrs offington the cause was as follows  one day my old friend captain forbes had invited me to dine with him at the bedford arms and after a choice dinner with plenty of good wine etc the captain said tate we will go to the play and added that he wished to go behind the scenes but as i went there only on sufferance i told him it was not in my power to oblige him  if so said my friend george we will not separate for i will treat you to the boxes being jolly with the bottle i assented and when arrived at the theater i could not prevail on him to sit any where but in the stagebox he was in full guard regimentals  myself by no means dressed fit to appear as his companion but as he persisted and led the way  i followed and in the front of his majestys stagebox we were seated and no more strange than true the lower sides exhibited a beggarly account of empty boxes and only a few persons were scattered in the front ones not an extraordinary circumstance to relate then of an unfashionable night at covent garden theater the play was the conederacy  being in such a conspicuous situation the eyes of the performers from behind the scenes were instantaneously attracted on beholding a poor young lad  a mere dependent  skulking nightly behind the curtain placed in a stage box  they were therefore astonished at my audacity in usurping and possessing such a particular seat of distinction  and a creature too that was destitute and soliciting for bread they naturally concluded i had gained admittance by an order and taken such a place by way of ignorant and impudent bravado the which deserved chastisement  they sent and spoke to mr rich and it was agreed that wilkinson should be instantly ordered from his improper situation a messenger was sent to put this mandate from mr rich in full force  the boxkeeper came to me and captain forbes warm with his wine and the insult offered to his friend soon convinced the official messenger of his mistake and the boxkeeper was sent back to assure mr rich that mr wilkinson was seated there by proper authority as captain forbes who was well known by being a constant box attendant at their theater had paid ten shillings for admittance this i was well informed caused a general greenroom laugh of contempt at the expense of the poor povertystruck gentleman in the stage box but unfortunately mrs woffington who acted clarissa having been frequently told that i was remarkable for taking her off as the phrase was and is came close to the stagebox finishing her speech with such a sarcastic sneer at me as actually made me draw back  my unfortunate star sure was then predominant for at that moment a woman of the town in the balcony above where i was seated repeated some words in a remarkable shrill tone which occasioned a general laugh like electricity it caught mrs woffingtons ear whose voice was far from being enchanting on perceiving the pipe squeek on her right hand and being conscious of the insult she had then given apparently to me it struck her comprehension so forcibly that she immediately concluded i had given the retort upon her in that open and audacious manner to render her acting and tone ridiculous to the audience as returning contempt for her devilish sneer she again turned and darted her lovely eyes though assisted by the furies which made me look confounded and sheepish all which only served to confirm my condemnation when the scene was finished and she had reached the greenroom  she related my insolence in such terms as rendered me a subject of abuse contempt and hatred with all the company but of that circumstance i was quite ignorant  at the instant i had it is true observed to my mortification mrs woffington looked angry but could not divine the real cause  the noon following when i attended mr richs levee i was kept in waiting a considerable time but as that was and is the too common fate of distressed dependence  patience was my friend and companion  at last mrs woffington passed through the room where i was thus humiliated and without a word curtsey or bow of her head proceeded on to her sedan from which she as haughtily returned and advancing toward me with queenlike steps and viewing me most contemuously said  mr wilkinson i have made a visit this morning to mr rich to command and to insist on his not giving you any engagement whatever  no not of the most menial kind in the theater  merit you have none  charity you deserve not  for if you did my purse should give you a dinner  your impudence to me last night where you had with such assurance placed yourself is one proof of your ignorance added to that i heard you echo my voice when i was acting and i sincerely hope in whatever bam you are suffered as an unworthy stroller that you will fully experience the same contempt you dared last night to offer me with a flounce and enraged features without waiting or permitting me to reply she darted once more into her chair i really was so astonished frightened and bewildered that i knew not how to act or think but was relieved from longer suspense and tedious waiting by a message from rich intimating that he could not see me at his levee either that day or in future or listen to any engagement whatever for my behavior was too gross and rude to be justified and i must immediately depart but the person added i might continue the liberty of the scenes during the season with this proviso that i should not on any account take the freedom to speak to mr rich  i wished not nor had the power to make an answer  provisions were short at home  my good mothers poverty increased  one good advantage this distress produced was that what i should have devoured that day with my noddle full of vanity was reserved for the next  my stomach being quite satisfied with grief shame and vexation poverty pursuing my steps my mother of course execrated rich and woffington  wept over her darling boy and flew to that refuge which she often declared always afforded her support and had never forsaken her even when sinking under the greatest affliction and that refuge was a constant address to the deity and a trust in his divine mercy however i would not give up the play that night nor in a pet resign my permission of being behind the scenes but the theater was no longer that earthly paradise i had formed for the mist was removed and i saw actors actresses and myself in a different mirror which convinced me what we all really were  when i went into the greenroom an universal laugh of contempt ensud  woffington the queen be of the hive was there  i had disturbed and offended her majesty and therefore all her faithful servants beelike joined to sting me except mr shuter who saw my distress and good naturedly took me by the hand  led me to his dressing room and desired me not to be cast down but observed i must not enter the greenroom again as they were one and all determined on my banishment in such a situation it will naturally be conceived i had a claim to pity and some little protection and that players must of course be the most cruel of all people  but i must in justice clear them from that imputation as they are in general benevolent and always ready to relieve the unfortunate but i had in their opinion then forfeited all title to commiseration and assistance as they felt themselves much hurt with the constant accounts they heard of my rendering most of the leaders in their profession ridiculous by my freedom of mimicry and the open and audacious affront which they believed and assured themselves i had given to mrs woffington which could not be removed or palliated mrs woffington being generous familiar and friendly to the comedians it was not surprising that they should obey her mandate which added to their own supposed wrongs agreed with their inclinations therefore as a common cause they all concluded such treatment to me was only inflicting strict justice on an ignorant pretending upstart  i own i often at that time practiced this said talent and had frequently set the table in a roar but that without any design or intention of injury to any one the fact lies plainly here  we can all laugh at each others foibles and peculiarities but think our own are not perceived or if perceived should be overlooked  if to do were as easy as to say what ought to be done and such a mode was adopted adieu all murdering of reputations and private peace that gorgeous meal for malignity i confess as a joker to have been free but never stabbed in the dark and i do also profess i kindly set down my own satire as harmless and from my heart most nobly and truly have forgiven injuries but fear i shall never bring myself to esteem those who ignorantly and wickedly have presented me in colors most disgustful and that in a point wherein they were so bewildered and egregiously mistaken that the true foundation of the story so far from shame or disgrace had honor and real humanity for its supporters at my last moments if able to articulate i shall not even in the agony of death deviate from this solemn oath and awful asseveration i have not inserted this on my own account but as incumbent on myself to cear the aspersed the unfortunate and miserable and i could wish my avowal recorded in the golden letters of truth over my grave where nothing  no nothing can touch me further  it is too often demonstrative and much to be lamented that persons of distinguished rank and pride can forget their true dignity and instigated by the appetite for scandal yield and mingle with the vulgar herd and on a bare supposition meanly stoop to throw poisoned arrows on the defenseless who if they themselves at that moment were reminded of the crimes and misdemeanors of their own families would shudder and shrink appalled  go bid them laugh at that  verily we all can ken many of such description but as they are numerous there is not any occasion for any one to put on the cap  unless it fits he who cannot rise superior to calumny may be a good man but never a contented one i will quit this intrusive matter and calmly observe to anonymous vipers  malice scorned puts out itself  but argued gives a kind of credit to a false accusation  but i must return to mrs woffington and be her theatrical herald and faithful chronologer she ever had a train of admirers she possessed wit vivacity etc but never permitted her love of pleasure and conviviality to occasion the least defect in her duty to the public as a performer six nights in the week has been often her appointed lot for playing without murmuring she was ever ready at the call of the audience and though in the possession of all the first line of characters yet she never thought it improper or a degradation of her consequence to constantly play the queen in hamlet lady ann in richard iii and lady percy in henry iv parts which are mentioned as insults in the country if offered to a lady of consequence  read this ye heroes and heroines  she also cheerfully acted hermione or andromache lady pliant or lady touchwood lady sadlife or lady dainty angelica or mrs frail and several others alternately as best suited the interest of her manager  at nine years old i became acquainted with mrs barrington of covent garden theater by being at the same school at wandsworth with mr t hale her son by her first husband mr hale the actor i had for some years been kindly received by her and annually at the time of her benefit traversed from st pauls to westminster to dispose of tickets which canvass generally proved productive but now the child of sorrow and having incurred the hatred of mrs woffington to whom mrs barrington was a close intimate even to adulation she withdrew her courtly smile glance or nod from poor tate who she was once proud of acknowledging  one evening some few weeks after my late mentioned disgrace mrs woffington was acting lady dainty in the double gallant  mrs barrington sylvia mrs vincent clarinda i ventured after much hesitation to say to mrs barrington i thought mrs woffington looked beautiful  mrs barrington tossed up her head and said that was no news as she looked so every night at which she and mrs vincent laughed  this occasioned mrs woffington to turn her head and condescendingly ask what they were smiling at mrs barrington replied that the young man was saying that lady dainty looked beautiful that night and added she had told him there needed not that information as she always looked so  mrs woffington viewing me disdainfully cried poor creature  o god says i what shall i do for bread  i had better exhibit in a barn but am not sure if i can even get that situation  my only comfort was my acquaintance with the facetious ned shuter it grew soon to a strong friendship for he took me to all his parties and that made my time glide more pleasantly i mentioned his kindness to my confidant captain forbes and also informed him what excellent company shuter was  he said he looked upon his civility shown to me as an obligation to himself he was then appointed on the command of the savoy guard and he desired i would constantly be with him and present a general invitation to mr shuter the compliment shuter seemed highly pleased with accepted of the favor offered him and went with me there very often  we had many pleasant parties captain forbes and shuter grew very intimate shuters talents were wonderfully shrewd quick sensible and to a degree highly entertaining  he was no mans enemy but his own one evening over our bottle shuter told me that his benefit was to be on the   th of march and he would get up never performed at covent garden the farce of lethe and would play mr garricks character of lord chalkstone and i should represent the fine gentleman a difficult part for any actor and at that time playing by woodward at drury lane who was in his zenith and was certainly the most improper character for me of any in the whole round of the drama but most young actors think if it be a principal one the business is done for it is a rule fixed in the theatrical corpse that parts make the actor  not the actor the parts they will also urge that managers can always by such partial means and subterfuge create as many great performers as they please but a very little reflection would evidently contradict it to the mortification of most of them because at that rate the loss of a grand actor or actress could always be supplied by the managers so if their doctrine be true the favorites of the public should not at any place trifle with the manager as according to that supposition the performer may foolishly and wantonly quit a good situation and the manager from his own creative quality as the carpenter of genius could mould and chisel any block to supply such a loss but true genius will show itself in the flightest character nor did shakespeare ever write a westmoreland or northumberland without strict attention to their true quality now and then actors nay even the ladies mistake their tatalents nor was mr garrick exempt who acted lord townly and sir harry wildair othello lord foppington pierre etc all unfit for him and they were judged so by the town  mr mossop the west indian mr ryan varanes mrs cibber lady townly and lady brute mr barry richard mrs clive zara quin chamont and young bevil and all this by their own choice therefore if such persons of judgment and experience were led away by their performing characters unfit for them it is not to be wondered at that i young and inexperienced should attempt the fine gentleman  however advertised for it i was and away went shuter and myself to monmouth street where for two guineas i was equipped with the loan of a heavy rich glaring spangled embroidered velvet suit of clothes and in this full dress fit for the king in hamlet with my hair in papers did i advance with timid steps through crowds of people for shuters popularity had brought the whole london world a large amphitheatre was built on the stage numbers were lying on the ground and only one entrance on each side to get on the stage and that was with great difficulty obtained however at last i was produced on the center of covent garden boards as a performer  and o grief of griefs as a fine gentleman  a great number of my late fathers friends were assembled the prepossession in favor of his sufferings  the public clamor and pity of the audience on my known destitute situation gained me such a reception as might have misled a wiser head than mine as audiences every where but at london in particular are ever considerate and encouraging to a young performer i do not mean to insinuate here that i possessed the promethean heat but it gave me courage to proceed for it was a perpetual applause i endeavored to copy woodward but with aukwardness and having no knowledge of the stage etc it certainly was a dreadful performance not but that some of my friends thought from the great approbation that was given and having no opinion of their own i had done wonders  i was so highly satisfied with myself that as soon as the scene was over and not having patience to wait till i was summoned with the other characters by mercury at the end of the farce i took a chair to mrs townsends where my mother was sitting and entered amongst the astonished circle of old ladies assembled together  all glittering with my fine dress and quite elevated with the applause and my own conceit myself being the harbinger of the joyful news the partial mother seeing her son so fine and fully persuaded he had acted well could not restrain the glistening tear no doubt prognosticating in her mind that she beheld in her offspring a second garrick  my ignorance was so great that i had intended also to have obliged the town with the frenchman in the same farce but was luckily persuaded from it for if that had really happened it must not only have deprived me of that happy night but have made it one of horror and irretrievable damnation  friday april the   th was fixed for the benefit of mr bencraft and mr costollo at covent garden the play was alexander and the part of alexander by mr barry they applied to me for to study don quixote in england and i readily agreed to it but thanks for once to my stupidity i was under the necessity of giving it up as i could not by any means drive the words into my pate and if i had it must have proved an unfortunate attempt therefore that quixote scheme being abandoned lethe was again substituted and they requested of me to act the fine gentleman which i consented to not but that i inwardly thought my alexander would have done as much for their interest as mr barrys however as that was not their opinion why hey for the river styx once more and i surely that night needed a draught of lethean waters to forget my cares  a dress was to seek for bencraft and costollo would not pay so extravagantly as shuter had for the hire of the grand velvet suit therefore the wardrobe of the theater was to furnish me but all the decent modern clothes were appropriated to the principal actors and on inspecting the grand repository mr whitfield the wardrobekeeper produced a very short old suit of clothes with a black velvet ground and broad gold flowers as dingy as the twenty four letters on a piece of gilded gingerbread  this apparel had not been brought tlit since the first year garrick played lothario at that theater in      when quin acted horatio which was the last character that he performed in the last week of may      as an engaged actor though he played twice after that his favorite character of falstaff for his friend ryans benefits     and       the suit being garricks i with eagerness snatched at it bedecked in that sable array for the modern fine gentleman and to make that appearance complete i added an old red surtout trimmed with a dirty white fur and a deep skinned cape of the same hue honored by old giffard i was informed at lincolns innfields theater to exhibit king lear in this grand dress with an old stock muff used for the gentleman usher in the rehearsal my hair in papers as on my first curious exhibition gave the tout ensemble to my all accomplished figure that when quite equipt had it not been for the whimsical contradiction of my large paper curls lord chalkstones motley nephew of delicate notions might have passed in a barn for a strolling sciolto no sooner had i made my entree than an involuntary fit of laughter seized the whole house from below to above and from above to below for such a contrast to the name or idea of a fine gentleman sure never was till then beheld the preposterous figure was heightened in absurdity by woodwards appearing every week in that character with infinite credit his acting was assisted by every elegance that whim dress fancy judgment and fashion could bestow whilst poor pilgarlik chose to finish the curious appearance by quitting woodwards manner entirely and spoke in my own voice which is naturally deep so that my tones were drowned with the excessive laughter and when i made my exit as the fine gentleman whether the peals of mirth or the universal hisses were the strongest seemed difficult to distinguish i would not appear again at the conclusion of the piece but flew to shuters dressing room to tear of my pomp and know myself but wanted not a sedan to convey me as before to mrs townsends the next days reflection presented fresh difficulties and approaching ruin  unfit for the stage what could i do my mothers existence was procured by the sale or pawning every trifle that could raise a few shillings and she trembling to view the darkened prospect when the last resources were expended compelled me to wait on mr rich once more and solicit him to retain me on any trifling salary for the ensuing year but i received a short and peremptory no you are unfit for the stage muster whittington and i will not larn you  you may go muster whittington and he stroked his favorite cat  summer did not promise me better than the winter had done for with my bad reception i could not get a recommendation or a probability of any engagement whatever even in the country monday may         as you like it was acted at covent garden for the benefit of mr anderson mr wignel and a mad gondou i was standing near the wing as mrs woffington in rosalind and mrs vincent in celia were going on the stage in the first act mrs woffington ironically said she was glad to have that opportunity of congratulating me on my stage success and did not doubt but such merit would insure me an engagement the following winter i bowed but made her no answer  i knew her dislike to me and was humiliated sufficiently and needed not any slight to sink me lower for then and not till then adversity had taught me to know myself she went through rosalind for four acts without my perceiving she was in the least disordered but in the fifth she complained of great indisposition i offered her my arm the which she graciously accepted i thought she looked softened in her behavior and had less of the hauteur when she came off at the quick change of dress she again complained of being ill but got accoutred and returned to finish the part and pronounced in the epilogue speech if it be true that good wine needs no bush  it is as true that a good play needs no epilogue etc etc  but when arrived at  if i were among you i would kiss as many of you as had beards that pleased me  her voice broke she faultered endeavored to go on but could not proceed  then in a voice of tremor screamed o god o god tottered to the stage door speechless where she was caught the audience of course applauded till she was ut of sight and then sunk into awful looks of astonishment both young and old before and behind the curtain to see one of the most handsome women of the age a favorite principal actress and who had for several seasons given high entertainment struck so suddenly by the hand of death in such a situation of time and place and in her prime of life being then about fortyfour she was given over that night and for several days but so far recovered as to linger till near the year     but existed as a mere skeleton sans teeth sans eyes sans taste sans every thing  vain is beautys gaud y flower  she died in rich circumstances colonel caesar of the guards was by agreement to have received all her possessions it having been settled between the colonel and mrs woffington that which of the two was the survivor should inherit all that the other possessed and this was signed by a will by each party but the generous colonel was deceived for she secretly made an after will while her colonel was engaged out at a dinner and left every article whatever to her sister mrs cholmondeley i dont believe even the shilling was bequeathed him and her sister not choosing to omit or let any infringement prevent her from faithfully executing the will of the dead demanded all mrs woffingtons paraphernalia from mrs barrington with whom all her stage jewels were lef in trust and from their long acquaintance she expected to enjoy them in their full luster with  good legacy added to cheer her woe on the occasion but to her great surprise mortification and disappointment the whole even to the minutest article was demanded and mrs barrington was unwillingly compelled to resign her crown her coronet and all the marks of royal distinction belonging to the late queen margaret  this profusion of stage pomp and grandeur the most rich and elegant of the kind and all of them set in silver in the hands of an actress was a property of great consequence looked most splendid and would have descended from queen to queen from phoedra to cleopatra from hermione to the grecian daughter in due tragical willprogression but in the hands of a lady of fashion only a few of them could with propriety be worn and as what profit could arise from the sale of them must be indeed contemptible i wonder she had not the pleasure of making a genteel gift to an old friend and acquaintance of her sisters particularly as mrs cholmondeley was secure of all the real jewels etc  having so often mentioned mrs woffington i naturally apprehend many persons who have not had the pleasure of seeing her would like a short description of that celebrated actress and having related so many particulars concerning that lady and pronounced authoritatively how much i was thought a strong caricature of her stage manner it might be judged that i could give some ideas as to a similitude which indeed i can with the strongest traits and at the same time compliment the present age on their possessing an actress in a first polished character in the arch and attractive miss farren such parts as lady townly maria millamant etc now represented by her were formerly thought mrs woffingtons best line of acting miss farren is to a certainty very like mrs woffington in some points and enchantingly superior in others miss farren as to every intrinsic quality may bid the world look on scrutinize and envy while on the opposite side we are compelled to place comparatively mrs woffington who also had her share of praiseworthy qualities yet a veil will be sometimes necessary to shade the frailties too often prevalent over the human disposition  scale of merit their complexions and features much alike  miss farren will be more like ten years hence before which time i hope she will be distinguished by some other appellation mrs woffington miss farren mrs woffington was tall so is miss farren mrs woffington was beautiful so is miss farren mrs woffington was elegant so is miss farren mrs woffington was well bred so is miss farren mrs woffington had wit so has miss farren mrs woffington had a harsh broken and discordant voice miss farrens musical and bewitching mrs woffington could be rude and vulgar miss farren never  so undoubtedly miss farren seizes the wreath of fame with security as she adds to her perfections in the scale of merit virtue modesty reverence to a parent and every other endearing quality therefore with propriety and for the credit of the drama let me hurl my cap and cry  long live the farren  so my dear agreeable miss farren for the present adieu  and now let me inform the reader that on the night of mrs woffingtons fatal illness mr wignell an under actor at covent garden was enlisting troops to form a party at maidstone in kent where it was said there had not been a company of comedians for some years and that one from london would of course do wonders i asked mrs barrington to intercede for me but she refused any interference i therefore waited on mr wignell who told me he was erecting a wooden booth at maidstone and that mr and mrs barrington who usually went to bristol were disappointed that year on account of some dispute with the mayor and he should find in them his cousins a tower of strength  mr barrington was not a very good comedian but yet was in low irishmen mr moody indeed excepted the best i ever saw  such as the teagues in the committee twin rivals etc but would have been a bad major oflaharty as he was in fact a very indifferent sir callaghan miss hallam was to be there niece to mrs barrington and had been bred under her with the utmost care and reared to be an accomplished actress as the reader will allow when i announce that miss hallam is the present mrs mattocks for whom i have and shall ever retain the highest regard and am indebted to both mr and mrs mattocks for repeated acts of kindness and friendship  i was from the emergency of mr wignells company not being filled to my delight accepted as a sharer and enrolled one of their commonwealth the performers collected for this kentish expedition were  mr wignell mr barrington mr morgan mr smith mr haughton mr clough mr jones mr wilkinson mr buck mr castle  mrs barrington miss morrison now mrs hull miss bradshaw mrs roberts mrs wignell mrs haughton and miss hallam  i got home and judged that i had for once done something like a transaction of business and also found i had the interest of a great friend of my mothers who i have the honor at this day to call a relation and to whom i am and have been greatly obliged  the ladys name was wardale she lived at carlisle to those who knew her i need not add praise those who did not may regret that they had not the pleasure of being acquainted with such an agreeable sensible well bred woman  this mrs wardale anxious for my situation and welfare had prevailed on the honorable miss foley sister to lord foley to ask the favor of a letter of recommendation from her intimate friend lord mansfield to mr garrick which his lordship immediately complied with so with those credentials i was to proceed on a visit the next day and which i assure the reader seemed to me to require more than common fortitude i marched up and down southampton street three or four times before i dared rap at this great mans door as fearing instant dismission might follow or what appeared to me almost as dreadful if graciously admitted how i should be able to walk move or speak before him however the rap was at last given and the deed was done past all retreating  is mr garrick at home  yes  then delivering the letter from miss foley with an enclosed one from lord mansfield and after waiting in a parlour for about ten minutes i was ordered to approach mr garrick glanced his scrutinizing eye first at me then at the letter and so alternately at last  well sir  hey  what now you are a stage candidate well sir let me have a taste of your quality  i distilled almost to jelly with my fear attempted a speech from richard and another from essex which he encouraged by observing i was so much frightened that he could not form any judgment of my abilities but assured me it was not a bad omen as fear was by no means a sign of want of merit but often the contrary we then chatted for a few minutes and i felt myself more easy and requested leave to repeat a few speeches in imitation of the then principal stage representatives nay  now says garrick sir you must take care of this for i used to call myself the first at this business  i luckily began with an imitation of foot it is difficult here to determine whether garrick hated or feared foot the most sometimes one sometimes the other was predominant but from the attention of a few minutes his looks brightened  the glow of his countenance transfused to mine and he eagerly desired a repetition of the same speech i was animated  forgot garrick was present and spoke at perfect ease  hey now now  what  all  says garrick how  really this  this  is  with his usual hesitation and repetition of words  why  well  well  do call on me again on monday at eleven and you may depend upon every assistance in my power i will see my brother manager mr lacey today and let you know the result  i now really thought fortune had done with tormenting me honored not only with the approbation but friendship of that great man i was elated into a degree of rapture i had not experienced for a long time and in truth i fancied that should the infallible pope garrick quit the stage either by death choice or accident i should in a few seasons be able to supply the vacant chair so light is vanity i did not walk but flew to my lodgings where my poor anxious mother sat trembling for the event  the noise i made in running up the stairs and my countenance on entering the room denoted in full evidence that she was to receive good  not bad news on my relating to her mr garricks kind behavior and his assurance of serving me she concluded her son tates fortune was made she blessed garrick she blessed me and we were both for that day perfectly happy something may be said in savor of my belief at that time as i was unacquainted with managers actors theaters and the world not that i mean to insinuate that every manager is a devil  i know the contrary that managers are men and have their faults and sometimes act wrong is natural and a spice of the devil in the composition is absolutely necessary or what would become of a manager at times when surrounded by agitated fiends  mine and my mothers dinner that day the   th of may was most luxuriant and i can affirm that neither his majesty nor any of his subjects dined with better appetite or greater happiness  not even my old friend mrs bellamy see her apology vol v page     who describes as she sat on the bottom step of westminster bridge where she remained for several minutes watching the gently swelling tide and blaming its tardy approach but thinking better of it she changed her cold situation and chose to return home where she found her maid to her great surprise had provided a good supper and declares that even in the most elevated situation she ever was in and when her table has been spread with dainties that she never made a more pleasing meal so the king of france with twenty thousand men marched up the hill and then marched down again shakspeare remarks if the man go to the water and drown himself it is will he nill he he goes mark you that but if the water come to him and drown him he drowns not himself  on the monday i negligently slid up southamptonstreet not with the tottering attendant fear of the preceding week i was spruced out knocked at the door with a degree of assurance was instantly admitted and not only found mr garrick alone but as soon as he saw me he expressed a wish of impatience for my promised visit said he had heard a most favorable account of my mother of whom he had made an enquiry and should be glad for the sake of so deserving a woman to assist me to the utmost of his power  this was a cordial to my heart and i believe it may be made a certain observation that whenever young or old wait on a superior as a dependent character he or she is anxiously tremulous until satisfied whether the grant can be obtained or not but now all appeared to me in a happy train  mr garrick said young gentleman i have seen mr lacey and we have determined to put you on the books at thirty shillings per week the ensuing season  i will think of some line of characters for you to perform on the stage  my time is short and not at my disposal this morning as i must be at hampton to dinner therefore as i am on the wing do oblige me with a repetition of what you recited last saturday  i readily complied and executed it with spirit  from the imitation of foot i proceeded with great alacrity to several others and when i came to those of mr barry and mrs woffington as macbeth and lady macbeth i was obliged to stop he seemed so truly entertained i thought it very comical and that the joke might not be lost i laughed too but on the merriment ceasing i perceived a concealed third laugher  the lady teazle behind the screen which greatly puzzled me when on a sudden a green cloth double door flew open which i found led to a little breakfast parlour and discovered a most elegant lady  no less a personage than mrs garrick who had it seems been purposely posted there for her secret opinion of my imitations of foot as mr garrrick always affected to pay great compliment to her judgment and opinion and i really believe not all acted complaisance but founded on real esteem  but like his brethren mortals had his frailties  mrs garrick apologized for her rudeness and intrusion  confessed she had taken possession of that snug spot unobserved at the desire of mr garrick as from his account of my imitations on the saturday she expected to be much gratified but when she heard the tones of mrs woffington the ridicule was so strongly pointed that it was not in her power to restrain from laughter by the pleasure and great satisfaction she had received if it had happened otherwise mrs mouse would not have appeared but kept snug in her hole  perhaps female prejudice here might operate in my favor as mr garrick had previous to his marriage with madam violette paid his devoirs to mrs woffington  before i took my leave i acquainted our rocius with my intention relative to maidstone which he approved and said practice would acquire me freedom and ease on the stage  it was what he had done previous to his public appearance in london but the chief lesson he would give to a young man trying his fortune on the stage was sobriety and above all  in a great character or in an inferior one however trifling it might be always to be perfect for that he observed was the groundwork for excellence in every walk of the drama and by attention to the author a novice would soon find from the feelings of his audience his natural bent as without being master of the words no actor could comprehend or execute the character or so far forget himself as to assume the being another person whether a king or a cobbler actors he said often mistook their talents by following their inclinations in lieu of their real genius but if always perfect a lucky hit might set them right and perhaps in the very characters they expected to fail in here ended garricks lesson i made my bow and departed not doubting but when the autumn approached i should read my name in the newspapers and as the apprentice says stuck in large capitals the part of othello by a young gentleman but  hope thou have told me lies from day to day   in a week my expedition to maidstone commenced my mother with much difficulty equipped me with five guineas capt forbes gave me a flaming purple satin waistcoat profusely trimmed with silver such was the fashion of those times which i reserved for sundays and visiting days  i stepped into the gravesend boat and for one shilling sailed with a fair wind and arrived at the end of my voyage safe but sick and from gravesend a stagecoach conveyed me to chathem and the next day in a chaise i arrived at maidstone it seemed to me a very long journey for going once with my father to sheerness when about the age of fourteen on some election business for a mr taffe of ireland was my extent of traveling and richmond hampton court and greenwich what i called going into the country and cockneylike thought my being once with captain forbes to windsor a tedious journey the country about maidstone seemed delightful but now it is almost past my remembrance  mr garrick had unknown to me spoke to miss bradshaw then of his theater but now no more to keep me as much as possible under petticoat government and to be one of her party at tea cards etc and to observe how i went on and to send him minute information in consequence of his request i was admitted like ptulant or witwoud into the female club on first subscribing the proper allotment stated for tea coffee sugar etc the quartette consisted of mrs bradshaw mrs roberts miss morrison and myself this brought on not only an acquaintance but a lasting friendship and high esteem between mrs hull and me if riches immense could be added to her other good qualities my praise here would not be neglected but read with pleasure the latter part of the season brought mr hull she introduced me to that gentleman and with whom good fellowship and good will has from that time and ever will i hope remain between us  were i to expatiate on the kindnesses i have experienced from mr and mrs hull i should make such a digression as might not be excused and therefore will conclude with thanks and truly wishing them every happiness and prosperity  we opened at maidstone with the beaux stratagem  archer mr wignell aimwell mr wilkinson foigard mr barrington dorinda mrs barrington mrs sullen miss morrison  not more than five pounds in the house i was much frightened very imperfect and more alarmed than when i first sported my figure in the fine gentleman the play except as to myself was got through decently the little motley troop from london certainly deserved more attention and encouragement than was bestowed  mrs barrington had an excellent wardrobe of her own and being the intimate of mrs woffington had the entire treasure of her tragedy jewels which at that time mrs barrington eyed as her own property by having nine parts of the law in her favor  possession her royal train should alone have been sufficient to have allured the country bumpkins added to the tragedy diamonds mr and mrs barrington amazed the eyes and ears of the little streets with a very handsome onehorse chair and every noon took a genteel airing they were wellbred sensible and behaved properly to every body there living with economy and every decency which could cause them to be esteemed and respected and were a credit to their profession our houses were shockingly attended though even i was the romeo barnwell shore orestes and the douglas in douglas without a joke i was very well received but not even my orestes nor mrs barringtons andromache could attract a sufficient audience those who attended we were obliged to dismiss from our booth the consequence was great grumbling great poverty and infinite uneasiness  some weeks not sharing six shillings and what was as bad  wignell my manager acted lord townly and made me perform a constable a drawer etc which much offended my dignity an error most young actors and actresses are apt to fall into if the performers do not approve of the parts allotted them they will against observation decency and common sense ever take pains to be ridiculous rude and absurd by which behavior they are certain every judicious thinking spectator bestows the censure on them which such conduct deserves  be it in a village a barn or theater  a performer will never convert an audience to the belief of finding him worthy of being trusted with a thousand lines if he does not speak six with great care attention and propriety what leads actors in some measure into this unfortunate and illconceived practice for their future welfare is listening to idle dissipated companions who too often are termed their friends and encourage them in such behavior while they are laughing on the stage because they do not know three lines of their damned parts as they term them and instead of joining the hiss for reformation to make them know themselves and feel the insult they have given the audience applaud them for it and are the occasion of leading the performers next day into what colley cibber justly remarks a jolly negligence of rehearsals and teach them to become dupes to their own folly players should one and all weekly repeat shakspeares advice he is the great masterly explanator  his single short lesson conveys the whole art and says more to the purpose than any laborious writer could cram into the largest folio  mr quin by proper conception of character made his first impression on the public by his respectful manner when acting the lieutenant of the tower but had mr quin treated it with contempt as i did the constable he might have missed the happy tide of fortune and continued in obscurity to the loss of his own future fame and the public would never have seen him as that excellent actor he ever after remained  mr quin had wit generosity and a strong understanding and by never forgetting his own dignity he was never forgot by others he obtained the respect and esteem of all his death was as much lamented by all ranks at bath where he resided as if the first man of quality there had departed this life and possessed of the same good talents and qualities  doctor mushett now in york will testify my assertion relative to mr quin as he attended him to the last and was for years intimately acquainted with him  i have had the pleasure of hearing and seeing that gentleman within these few years at general st legers introduce mr quins character in such a manner as to be a striking portrait of that celebrated man a demonstrative proof that however the illiberal the ignorant the malevolent the envious and the enthusiast the conceited or the vain may treat stage professors yet where talents are graced with virtues the actor will be acceptable at any table it is galling to remark but it is a truth that it is the actor which disgraces the stage and not the stage the actor and the vulgar not knowing how to distinguish indiscriminately throw the good and the bad in the same dirty reservoir of disgrace to prove the assertion true many actresses by the help of natural genius only the gift of god himself have arrived at the summit of fame and fashion  as mrs oldfield bracegirdle cibber woffington bilamy crawford etc but if persons of rank and fortune could offer such respect to stage talents only what difference must they think and eel when paying that polite tribute where superior talents adorned by virtue are combined in the name of siddons her example as a wife and mother the greatest need not blush to follow and those who from misfortune labor in a degraded and middling line may be proud to admire and imitate  mrs siddonss private worth deserves regard the credit of the stage may always wish it to be preserved and never struck from its annals mrs cibber is the only actress my remembrance can compare with mrs siddons and mrs cibber in five or six parts might be if on the boards and in equal bloom able to occasion the odds but it would be a contest of a confined nature as mrs siddonss lady macbeth zara in the mourning bride etc were characters mrs cibber could not have attempted with any degree of comparison and mrs siddons in a theatrical lottery would certainly obtain fifteen prizes out of twenty no bad compliment to mrs siddons for if her predecessors are to be considered by her admirers as people who knew nothing of the matter her praise must be less on a comparative struggle for victory certainly where disdain contempt pride or indignation are to be expressed it may safely be affirmed she there stands unrivalled and is herself alone in one passage she always reminds me of mrs cibber in voice manner and features where in isabella she pronounces  now i defy you  now i laugh at you ye tyrants murderers  i do not mean to insinuate mrs siddons has ot foibles or faults  i can only say if she has i am not acquainted with them but says llnature i am sure she does so and so  and why so much pains anxiety and labor to insinuate that mrs siddons is not al perfection let the accusers take the same pans to look at their own faults and pluck the beam from their own eye and then fairly make the comparison and let them ever keep in mind mens evil manners live in brass their virtues we write in water    i will conclude mrs siddonss panegyric with this wish that every lady on the stage may follow her example in private life and with proper emulation endeavor to surpass or equal her in her public character  having taken the liberty to be so free with my opinion as to the several stage favorites and having entioned mrs cibber only as competitor with mrs siddons i cannot but in justice and gratitde also with shame recollect i had forgot mrs yatess merit not to mention her attractive person her margaret of anjou stands as much urivalled as does mrs siddonss zara her epilogue to that play must not be forgot nor her elegance and various excellencies or mrs crawfords fifth act of lady randolph i fancy myself jogged by some old critic  o for shame not to recollect mrs pritchard indeed i do  her manner and person were clumsy her face not delicate but open and agreeable yet with that large figure she in comedy nay even in the fine ladies threw all competitors at a distance her lady betty modish mrs sullen maria and beatrice were wonderful and her clarinda was so easy so natural so spirited and vivacio that in the third act her comic powers were such as to cast all other actresses at so great a distance as made the beautiful woffington shrink under her superior and combined excellence in tragedy lady macbeth was by much her best part  and good acting it was but she was not so finely collected throughout as mrs siddons is in that character mr garrick assured me he did not approve of her tragedy for her scenes of grief were tiresomely blubbering in no part more remarkably so than in the last scene of volumnia in coriolanus i had forgot to mention mrs cibber though very indifferent indeed as a comic actress but to which she foolishly gave the preference she spoke an epilogue equal if not superior to any lady i remember  to say those ladies had merit is the true compliment to those of the present day for what modern performers insinuate that the late actors did t understand the art of playing is paying themselves a very bad compliment as i observed before if mrs cibber had been comparatively an indifferent actress where is the wonder that mrs siddons should be superior i urge it is mrs cibbers great excellence raises mrs siddonss reputation  indeed were snarlers to advance that music peras theaters singers and splendid scenery to plays in the present era were not on a par with the magnificence of the year    0 then indeed all credit might with propriety be rendered doubtful and the names of barry cibber or even a garricks reputation would require caution and consideration as to the belief  most undoubtedly the improvements are wonderful but beyond the mark of profit for managers were thirty years ago gentlemen of more than ideal property but now in all the three kingdoms produce me an independent one i wish there were many contradictions to this assertion and myself included in the number  i have made such a digression on stage matters that i have left myself acting the constable etc far behind like the prisoner at large so must return to maidstone duty where the business was so bad that we were obliged to begin the benefits in hopes that what our good acting could not produce ye regard for individuals would soften their hearts and fill the house  i had the distressed mother the amount only three pounds  my profit on the expenses being deducted was actually one shilling and sixpence and two pieces of candle  a dismal banquet for prince orestes  i was reduced to two shillings consequently under the necessity of asking leave of absence like a boy at school for not being a constable on the monday and i would return on the wednesday which being granted i resolved on a long walk being then much more convenient than the stagecoach to gravesend from thence in the gravesend boat arrived in london and drained three guineas more from my affectionate mother  necessity has no law thus replenished i returned back and got to maidstone on tuesday night  i had not exposed my poverty to the troop if i had they were neither able nor willing to have relieved me  avowed poverty would have lowered me immediately and my five guineas when i first went to maidstone had enabled me to appear in a genteel decent manner on this my first tour i was grasping for great parts but from timidity and not having time to be perfect my prospect was not the most favorable  miss bradshaws secret account a toad eater the spawn of adulation did not lead mr garrick to any favorable expectations a curious letter of my own to mr garrick blotted badly spelt and very incoherent confirmed his then growing ill opinion of me and he had declared from the maidstone accounts which he relied on that nothing could be done with me wilkinson was a stupid lad and he had for once deceived his judgment on a sudden surprise  the business grew worse and worse  benefits instead of improving or giving hopes of an approaching harvest overshadowed us with clouds and darkness we were all poor and sulky  neither to be led nor drove  soldiers unpaid who hardly did their duty   the manager by paying his bills etc and being what they termed a good stroller who understood well the art of application and solicitation was certain of a good benefit mr and mrs barrington from their dignity carriage and diverse marks of distinction also expected the same nay seemed assured of it now we the said soldiers and our lasses did not approve of this determined distinction intended by the inhabitants of maidstone to feed the rich and let us poor be the marks for scorn to point its slowly moving finger at the consequence was a conspiracy  which soon burst out and flamed into an open rebellion a memorial of dissentients was signed and presented that as the playhouse in the star yard maidstone was so ill attended and as there were so many sufferers they could not  would not proceed or act any more in that booth for the emolument of two or three persons as to continue a fortnight longer would plunge all in the utmost penury and want alluded to numerous inconveniences therefore unless they were mutual gainers they would not undergo difficulties and distress for the advantage of the trio and themselves in want of means for existence this was immediately assented to signed and sealed by the manager and mr and mrs barrington or a revolt the next day was determined this demand cannot be justified on honest grounds because had any one of us four weeks before that been blessed with a crowded house that one would have judged it a robbery to have been compelled by the rest who had failed to have shared the profit amongst them however if poverty is a plea for an act of injustice that point we could prove and swear to with safe consciences  as we thought wignell and the barringtons getting such an amazing sum as nineteen or twenty pounds was too luxurious a prospect while we were in so barren and dreary a state the result was that with the assize week and the two benefits equally divided matters closed with such brilliancy that on my return to london i was enabled to restore two guineas back to my mother in part of payment for the three she had obtained for me with difficulty and it was a double gift as the received it from that welcome visitor her son  early in september      drury lane opened and i attended as being then enrolled on the royal list of his majestys company of comedians mr garrick acted early in october  his second character was romeo and without having looked or spoke to me or even affording me an opportunity of addressing him when i saw him on the rehearsal of romeo and juliet i was summoned on the stage by cross the prompter who said he had orders from mr garrick that i should wait as a torch bearer in the last act and also as a waiting gentleman in every play on which mr garrick advanced and before the company said aloud this sir is my command  and if not complied with i shall take your coat off and do the business myself and you sir will immediately be dismissed my theater there certainly was a severity in this for though i stood astonished grieved and petrified at this sudden appointment i had not refused and therefore the pointed manner in which he spoke was tyranny in a degree i never then had seen exercised without provocation i cannot but at the present moment think this unprovoked behavior in my then situation was cruelty to the extreme what secret pique he had for such sudden treatment i never could learn but he really made me truly miserable  and if he aimed at that as an act to gratify ambition he accomplished his purpose  the theater being for the first month opened three nights in a week my salary was only fifteen shillings as playhouse pay and when got to four nights merely twenty shillings but that pittance was too material an object for me to think of relinquishing i waited as it is termed in the mourning bride  the funeral procession in romeo and juliet  macbeth and twice rode a hobby horse in the field of battle when garrick acted bays early in the season mr foot was to play cadwallader in the author which farce had been produced the winter before and acted with great success foot was to perform six nights then go to dublin and return in january and revive the same farce again  the author was at that time so fashionable tha becky  my dear becky was a constant phra from all ranks of people both high and low  they walked the streets of london i have ev been supposed a pupil of mr footes  the fowing circumstance will prove the contrary for on my word of honor i had never seen mr foot till that very season behind the scenes excpt as a performer on the stage  had i met him n the street or seen him in a room i do not beee i should have known him the last week of mr footes playing in drury lane previous o his intended trip to ireland he was accidentally with garrick after his performance of kitely as was mr holland and others the conversation s i was informed by chance turned on imitaon  garrick said egad foot there is a young fellow engaged with me who i really think is superior to either of us at mimicry  i used to think myself well at it but i actually gve him the preference he has tried to resemble me but that will not do though mrs garrick sas she is sure he will be like me  damn t says foot i should like to hear him holland with garricks approbation came immeately to inquire for me i was soon found a the greenroom and escorted to the aagers cabinet assuring me that mr garrick anted to see me on particular business my art panted with fear doubt and hope on this expected summons after an awkward entrance d a silence of a few minutes my suspense was ed by mr garrick very good naturedly saying that he had spoke well of me to mr foot and desired i would satisfy that gentleman with a taste of my quality such as first struck my fancy adding that he expected i would do my best in order to convince his good friend mr foot that his assertions of my merit were not exaggerated i complied and as the phrase is took off sveral performers  barry sparks wossington ridout sheridan etc  received high encomiums and thanks  made my bow and retired from the august assembly mr o  n now living not then on the stage can testify all these partiulars  the next day my friend mr o  n who was intimate with foot waited on me with tha gentlemans compliments intimating that he wa going to dublin for a few weeks in five or si days time  he had observed mr garrick though me only fit fr his hobby horse in the rehearsal and if i ished to be released from such tyranny he would be glad of my company to ireland  his own  and he would fix me on genteel erms with mr sheridan  that i should appear in othello and he would act iago the was a cheering cordial elixir to my droopi spirits and to my still more drooping pocket turned over in my mind several of the irish fmilies mentioned in the early part of this work d that was one inducement  another was my situation might be bettered but it could not be worse and on a short reflection i desired my repetful compliments with my mothers approon to mr foot and was apprehensive i ight incur mr garricks displeasure and if i should be so unfortunate as not to meet with a faurable reception in ireland i should in consequence thereof be greatly involved on my return to england if i should be expelled from drurvane theater for though the pittance i then reed was small yet trifling as it was it was my only support but if mr foot could obtain mr garricks permission i would gladly embrace the offer begging that mr o  n on the delivering my message would not omit my sense of mr footes kindness and good opinion mr o  n undrtook this embassy most cheerfully and exctd t with friendship and punctuality mr  te without loss of time waited on mr garrick that very day and acquainted him with what ha pasd and obtained my leave of absence for  weeks  on the evening i met my master garrick at  thatre who consirmed the above treaty and  he was glad of an opportunity to serve me  hped it would turn out advantgeous but s it was probable as well as possible the expedition might fail and i might not meet with success he had from his motives of tenderness for me consulted with mr lacey his brother manager and that i might not want an asylum n case of failure and disappointments he had ordered an article to be drawn up for two years from that day the  0th of october to the end of the season       the managers giving me their consent for an absence of six weeks with mr foot i dared not object to the proposal and indeed thought his reasons friendly and afforded a prospect of bread for two years by which time i hoped that warmer days might come the article of course was prepared and signed my equipment was poorly provided  my old black was my only suit a small pair of bags easily contained my wardrobe my mother dreaded this long voyage and being used to vexation and crosses  experience made her give me but little hopes from irish hospitality or the appearance of a shabby distressed lad soliciting favors  for friends will fly you in the time of need   from lodging livelihood and support al that my mother could spare to give me to supply my empty purse with was six shillings bu luckily mrs wardale the lady of carlisle beforementioned hearing of my journey an knowing mine and my mothers inability presented me with two guineas i took leave of my affetionate parent  met mr foot at the bedrd arms and in one hour after set off with im in a post chaise and his servant on horsebk we only traveled that night to his little ttage at elstree in hertfordshire two days after that we dined at kitty keneys at west chester and the following day went with captain bonfoy who was then commander of the royal yacht for parkgate as the captain said he would sail that afternoon  here we were detained th seeral persons of fashion who had been impatiently attending on the caprice of the wind mr hill an elderly gentleman lord macartney mr leeson now lord milltown and several others we all went on board but all returned as the wind continued obstinate we all messed together for footes company as he was well acqainted with each was the only treat that truly dreary place parkgate could afford our patiene being exhausted it was unanimously agreed that we should proceed to holyhead horses were hired  this was early in november and was not pleasing to me who had never rode twenty miles on horseback in my life however there was no alternative as i was become a dependent traveller and must submit to follow i though we were all to have set off together  they went at seven oclock in the morning requesting footes company at each house they stopped at but foot and myself remained behind and on my asking him the reason of his delay he answered that it was a rule of his and worth my observation  that whenever he met with persons of distinction and fortune on the road traveling to small inns as was and is the case on the welsh roads he made it a rule always to be half a day behind or before them as with all their politeness they expected the best accommodations or if they were so kind as to offer you a preference you could not in policy or good manners accept such an offer therefore you never could on such a journey be well suited or attended unless by being the stage at least before or after them and if going to another inn the landlady of the neglected house would pique herself on her behavior to convince her guests they had paid the compliment of preference not to her only but for their own comfort and advantage  i performed this journey on horseback better than i expected and was truly struck with wonder on passing the stupendous mountains of penmanmeaur and penmenbough indeed penmanmeaur then not only from its astonishing height but from its perilous and immediate drop into the roaring deep gave every idea of horror which the pets pen could describe it is not so tremendous now for though that mountain still  its lofty head above the clouds yet a  read is at present cut for a carriage which       was not and instead of falling from the prpie into the deep if your horse stumbled tre is a friendly wall to secure you from such  danger  holyhead in wales is about tytwo miles from west chester there we e detained again some days and strange but true the high living with the persons at that place and a severe cold had kept me ill in bed most pt of that day the wind changed but it changed to a violent storm  will fortune never come with both hands full and at nine at night all dark and dismal did we roll in the boat belonging to the packet over waves most dreary to behold for the whitenss of the breakers shone double from the darkness of the night when handed into the packet i asked for a bed but they were all secured not even one for mr foot  as plenty of cash from the great people had made that request possible to be complied with the cabin was edged like the blackhole at calcutta the multuous moving of the ship soon made my inquiries after a bed of down quite needless for i sunk on the boards where my poverty bags were my only pillow and there i lay tossed in the most convulsive sickness that can be imagined i have seen many suffer by this sea malady but never i verily think such an object of commiseration as myself the storm increased but the wind was fair for ireland  as to death i was so truly sick that i was very indifferent whether i sunk or swam mr foot was tolerably well and walking most of the night from place to place  thank god we arrived safe in dublin bay about twelve oclock and by one was taken in a dunlarey hoy to dublin quay a coach conveyed us to a tavern in collegegreen where we were regaled i say we though i continued very sick and much out of order indeed my stomach was ever inflated and disturbed with a bilious complaint which may be called hereditary and that added to my irregular mode of living and neglect of healthful exercise should make me thankful it has not yet entirely overthrown me in about an hour mr foot went to the lodgings provided for him and left me to take care of myself i inquired for a hotel and was directed to one on essex quay to which place i took coach where overpowered with illness sickness and fatigue i went to bed and lay till monday noon but in a comfortless state i rung the bell for breakfast but it did not afford relief and about four oclock in the afternoon crawled to the house i remembered to have left the day before in collegegreen where i had some soup chicken and wine and after sitting full two hours fancied myself better owing to the momentary spirits the wine had given me paying for my repast i inquired of the waiter where mrs chaigneau ved he replied just over the way this was agreeable intelligence as indeed that was the amily the reader i hope will kindly recollect i so particularly mentioned in the first part of my history  then my fluttering heart hoped welcome to the poor the orphan and the stranger next the apprehension of a rebuff occurred but distress of situation pushed me on and to the house as directed i went  when i advanced with trembling and tottering steps to the corner palace and enquiring if mrs chaigneau was at home i was answered with an affirmative  i desired the servant to acquaint his mistress that a person from england requested to speak with her and after waiting a few minutes which my impatience doubled a thin looking lady entered the room but i could not recollect a feature or any likeness to resemble the form i expected to ehold but supposed time or illness might have made heavy inroads on the brittle frame  with the utmost agitation i presumed to inquire if her name was chaigneau the lady answered  yes i then ventured to pronounce madam i flatter myself you recollect me when you was in england my name is wilkinson son of the late doctor wilkinson of the savoy she answered indeed sir you are mistaken this was a thunder stroke as my fears interpreted it a wilful disclaiming of her knowledge of me but i was after a pause relieved by her looking serious and repeating to herself   ilkinson wilkinson  and suddenly said o young gentleman i beg your pardon believe i can now clear up this mistake in which we both are at present involved  i have often heard your father and mother mentioned in terms of the highest regard by my brother and sister chaigneau  you as a stranger have made a mistake as to the house i am married to mr john chaigneau brother to mr william chaigneau and to whose house you have been wrongly directed  they live in abbeystreet i not knowing the way she requested her servant might call a coach for me which was instantly done as there was then and always is a stand of coaches in collegegreen i took my leave  apologized for the trouble i had given was drove to abbey street and on my road over essex bridge was vatly pleased at seeing the number of lamps sedan chairs carriages hackney coaches footmen with flambeaux etc as it appeared to resemble another london when arrived at abbey street and the awful rap was given i was not only from frequent misfortunes and disappointments all flutter but found myself not well yet i gave myself the comfort to attribute it to ancied illness proceeding from anxiety distress and unaccustomed fatigue and therefore hoped t would go off the first answer to my inquiry at mr william chaigneaus door from the servant was that he could not tell whether either his master or mistress were at home or not but would go and see he soon returned with an answer more potent than the first that they were both at home and what was more fortunate they were without company i had no sooner entered the room where they were sitting then  then what  why to proceed requires the best of novel pens to present fulfill and do service to the seen that followed this generous mr william chaigneau and wife were on the list of the few instances where mutual temper with unclouded ray could make to morrow welcome as to day   their pleasures were the same  their affections were the same their instantaneous recollection of me  the great intimacy between the families  my fathers death and calamities being so lately public and now refreshed to their memory revived the idea of their own distress from the loss of their darling child the infantmarriage between me and that daughter my present assured unfortunate helpless situation with a look of desponding hope dependent on their feelings all collected rushed on their alternate sudden thoughts with such quick transitions as made them all combined too mighty for mrs chaigneaus tender spirits indeed so powerfully that the fictitious distress of lady randolph on the stage was by no means equal to her poignant sense of my misery and situation and it was actually sometime before she could recover herself with any degree of composure to inquire what had brought me there or what could be done to serve me mr chaigneau was also greatly agitated but not to so extravagant a degree as my good benefactress as she afterward proved to the utmost extent after a little composure and my full relation of what had happened to my mother and myself since the fatal marriage act passed a comfortable supper was set on the table after which pleasing ceremony they assured me that every exertion in their power and all their friends and connexions i might as much depend upon as if the welfare of their own son was the person whose interest they were to plead for  during a short interval i felt elated beyond myself the transition was so wonderful but alas how fleeting are human joys as to pain hope or sorrow for soon after this pleasing unforeseen sensation of rapture i suddenly sunk into an heavy everish languor not in my power to uphold mrs chaigneau exclaimed my god tate is ill her words were prophetic  i wished and tried to shake it off but all in vain  disorder and derium grew too powerful my head felt dreadfully deranged my real friends in every sense of the word were alarmed mrs chaigneau declared the cold not permit me by any means to return to the hotel in such a state of apparent illness as i then seemed to labor under they sent to the next door engaged a comfortable lodging for me and provided me with hockwine whey and ch accommodations as they thought immeiately necessary the ensuing day instead of finding myself relieved i was seized most dangerosly by an outrageous miliary fever i had from their wonderful attention and regard the attendance of one of the first physicians then in dublin doctor lucas and their own apotheary with a constant careful nurse mrs chaigneau preferred waiting on tate to the luxury o company she and her cousin mrs carty during the day were seldom from my bedside a stranger to have seen mrs chaigneau weeping over me must have supposed it her own dying son she was lamenting i have often heard her repeat that except the death of her dearly beloved daughter she never suffered such distress and said it awakened so strongly the remembrance of the sudden loss of her only child ever by her to be lamented that it excited her feelings beyond the power of restraining them and recollection brought fresh to her memory her long intimacy with my worthy mother and knowing her life of almost perpetual sorrow by affliction heaped on affliction and viewing in every light my helpless situation these all conjoined was too much for her spirits to support  in that outrageous fever did i continue and in a truly lamentable state with a complication of distraction and agony for near three weeks blisters on my ancles and every physical torture to increase my miseries mr chaigneau often used to joke and say what an expensive guest i was to him for his old hock the quantity i drank in whey by his account was incredible however providence aiding my youth brought me once more into the world and here i must not omit my sincere and grateful acknowledgments to god for good reader will you believe it that all this time of my severe suffering notwithstanding mr foot must have heard i had left the hotel and ern with evident marks of indisposition he never once to the disgrace of christianity be it asserted made inquiry whether i was living or dead or if living whether i had decent necessaries d with regret i am obliged to relate that had i  left dependent on his care though such an  ect of compassion i had never from the dictates of his feelings or pity his honesty or honor  to give this relation of my illness and i ould have remained for him truly destitute ng no mother or friend that he knew of in ieland o close my eyes but god raised me friends therefore i have indeed reason to rejoice and praise my maker  before i was able to go abroad or even to leave my apartment i sent my compliments to mr ote to acquaint him where i was for mr and mrs chaigneau were so offended at such brutality of behavior toward me that neither of them ad ven him any intelligence concerning me r foot on my information waited on mr igeau and by way of apology said he could  se me for three or four days for fear of ching the infection from the fever  professed himself anxious to supply my wants which he was informed was at that time quite unnecessary after that he waited on me as my most anxious friend  and in about three weeks i recovered so fast by the help of my good nurses that i dined every day with my preserving angels at the next door was attended every noon with jellies etc and what was more extraordinary had my chariot every morning at the door to take my daily aring  o gemini a coach the scene was changed  was altered quite and indeed it was as sudden and unexpected a metamorphose as that of the cobblers wife in the devil to pay  as soon as i was able to be taken by my patrons a visiting an elegant suit of clothes was provided for me that i might be a credit and not by my threadbare appearance disgrace either my friends or myself mr and mrs chaigneau introduced me to all their acquaintance nor could they be pleased more than by any act of kindness that was bestowed on me their connections were particularly numerous mr william chaigneau being principal agent to most of the regiments on the irish establishment and was consequently universally known and likewise respected  all the families in ireland with whom my father and mother had formerly been intimate in london proved by innumerable acts of generoty and true zeal for my welfare that friendship i sometimes more than a name their deeds and actions to me gave full evidence of their partlity nor do i in this account deceive the reader with the smallest particle that is erroneous for there are those that are living who can attest it inutely yet were i now to land in this said dublin where i was thirtytwo years ago univerly acquainted the theaters excepted i do t know one house i could with propriety approach  such quick and certain havoc does that said voracious monster death make with mankind on my visiting abroad i was soon ined to lord forbess in stephens green also to the kellys alderman and mrs forbes achesons callages john chaigneaus coatess hamiltons etc and received particular favors from those persons as well as from lord clambrasil lod bellamont lord milltown mr hill miss knoxes etc etc at each of the above families in the full meaning of the word i had a home and i never received a cool look unless for staying away though a favor may be bestowed with an ill grae and i will beg leave here to give an instance lord forbes i had been used to see frequently in london even from the time of my wearing roks and i am certain his invitations in dublin were intended most friendly and his will was ever to serve me but one day on dining with his lordship when several persons of quality were invited  the bottle our sun of the table after dinner moved quickly round and as the wine circulated not feeling any restraint and his lordship not being a ranger to me i very heartily smcked my lips and said o my lord this is excellent wine on which he paused and looking fll at me by which means he drew the attention of the whole company said with a satirical smile pray tate what or who has made you a judge of wine never give your judgment in company as to wine for in a young man like you it is not becoming or proper this effectually silenced me nay it did worse than that for it made me feel my inferiority and i as abashed and unhappy till released that evening from the company of the great and which two hours before had greatly elaed me nor do i think it excusable in any rank whatever by any speech or look to lessen the guest inted in the presence of others for bread and cheese at home is preferable though the dependents dinner may be termed an honor  from such honor with such behavior heaven defend me  that lord orbes had a more than common right to give his free sentiments to me is certin and beyond doubt meant it well is as certain but time and place in many things make ch material difference as the same actions suit not all men alike for had his lordship privately rprimanded me it would have been an obligation but in the manner he did it  i to this moment ink it was cruel and ill bred it made such an ipression that notwithstanding after that i had a general invitation from him which i could not rm duty and policy avoid accepting yet i always whed the hour of visiting his lordship was over  this leads me to a like anecdote which suddenly and impulsively bursts on my recollection a st eseemed gentleman in the spacious county of york whose polished understanding and manners were universally acknowledged and admired even to the extent of popularity in the great world me few years since desired to patronise a pla i sent my treasurer with the catalogue as is usual on such occasions to any leading person but on looking over the list of tragedies comedies and rcs he declared he could not determine and desired mr wilkinson would attend him and his party after dinner at the inn where he then for a few days resided which mandate i obey and without being arrogant in my idea s his majestys patentee undoubtedly expted being favored with fitting at the cheerful board and holding some chit chat relative to the play and farce that he intended to sanction instead of such usual and indeed common civility after waiting a considerable time in the bar i was at length ushered into the room where the company had dined when sir   beckoned me to approach him at the upper end of the table where i impertinently expected to have sat down but neither found a vacancy or the waiter even ordered to produce me a chair sir   discoursed relative to the play  then of york city graciously observed i had acted bays so as to merit his approbation and to heighten the compliment remarked he was no judge as he seldom visited the theater either in london or elsewhere at length he condescendingly asked me to drink a glass of wine which i begged to decline but he requested a worthy and respectable gentleman now living to give a glass the which he handed as if i had been a common porter waiting for a message for i actually stood all the while at the backs of their chairs i was most truly happy to depart and from that day lost all anxiety or ray of inclination to pay my devoirs or wait on that great man who was then termed the grandison of the age  i would attribute this to want of thought at the time but i do not see how that could be the cse for so long a space where sense and good breeding were by all allowed to be the characteristic qualities of that gentleman i am aware i shall be blamed by particular persons for mentioning the above but in order to disarm unfair anger  five minutes pause and a little allowance may save my condemnation if i restrained myef from relating little matters which have pleased r vexed me  i should by such a rule be depriv of the liberty of expressing my thoughts when erently affected i dare say although it is a ct which i have related it will be argued it night have been omitted i subscribe to that pinion but then let every feeling mind condr that if i am allowed the freedom to express my being hurt by a person of quality in ireland and to whom i was so greatly obliged i certinly have a right to mention the other in ngland for unless respect due to his rank and character obligations i had none and in conusion it was only a speck upon ermine  but his present grace the duke of norfolks beaiour to me is as great a contrast i could fill a olume with encomiums but that would offend m  and he is so universally known and beloved that what i could say would be only superfluous  to grace a title that was rich before  to gild refined gold  is wasteful and ridiculous excess   his grace of norfolk is plain in his attire possesses wit accompanied with infinite understanding that leads his natural temper which is gracious and condescending in his manner friendly and honorable and is ever endeavoring to promote the cheerfulness and happiness of others yet let not that easy manner betray ignorance into the error of being too familiar for though his graces strong sense and good nature may smile and pardon yet that person will find himself egregiously wrong who supposes that the first of his majestys subjects in the kingdom of great britain ever forgets he is the duke of norfolk therefore let inferiors out of regard to themselves bridle their familiarity and always remember that every deference is justly due  permit my lord duke to sink his own rank to render himself still more agreeable and bestow heartfelt joy at the sprightly board but ignorance beware of too much encroachment lest such impolicy incur his secret contempt and like macbeths vauling ambition you oerleap yourself and fall on the other side to those who are honored with the acquaintance of his grace of norfolk or to those who are strangers i would pourtray my ideas of that nobleman in the words of home that  in his eye sits observation in each glance of thought decision follows as the thunderblt pursues the flash   but having carried myself into yorkshire as i le traveling let me now return to my station in dublin near christmas i began to think of making my appearance on the stag  mr chaigneau invited mr sheridan the manager mr victor and mr foot to dinner mr footes me of acting drew near an expiration he had played cadwallader in particular with great suce lord foppington sir paul plyant bays fndlewife buck etc he said to mr chaigu at dinner that he thought it necessary for mr wilkinson to make his appearance on the dublin stage before he departed all joined in the me opinion mr chaigneau wished me to see the theater mr victor was to dine with him the next day in a familyway and to take me tre  mr sheridan was all politeness the first  aw was in the lattices with mr victor which  are what is called in london the  the play was the recruiting officer  mr  first appearance in that kingdom in the ater of captain plume he has since given rsal satisfaction both as manager and actor  ireland and his merit is now well known and confirmed in england foot acted brazen isaac sparks kite sylvia by a miss kennedy who soon retired well provided for by the generosity of mr l gardener  it was appointed for me to appear the monday following in mr footes tea in the character o a pupil under mr puzzle the supposed directo of a rehearsal  mr puzzle by mr foot h sent me a part called bounce but which i begged as the time was so short to decline and as i did no attend any rehearsal it was agreed that i should appear as mr wilkinson his pupil when calle upon and repeat just what i could select to pleas myself  not any regular character  when the night came lord forbes mr chaigneau and all my friends went to encourag and support me and engaged all they knew o the same purpose one lucky circumstance wa my not being known as a performer therefore had their wishes and pity in a high degree  bu great fear of my not being able to succeed th story of my distressed situation  the blazoned marriageact  my being a young gentleman  my illness etc etc were become topics of public conversation as to intelligence requested by critics from the players relative to myself they neither did n could pronounce with knowledge either good  ill but i will rather suppose five out of six spo  my disadvantage from the too general depraty of human nature as persons listen to satire ther than praise it is more descriptive displays e tripping tongue and suits conversation much etter it gives energy to the informant and  ears to the languid  the bill ran thus after the play by eight in the evening i was in full dress behind the scenes i had never been there before the company were all strangers to me i not knowing how to enter into conversation with the perormers and being announced as a pupil of mr footes i did not receive any civility from them or if i was a blockhead i was not worth their oce and if an impudent imitator or mimic of their profession bred by mr foot in the same rthy art i was in their opinions a despicable trder i could conceive all this and certain my situation on this critical night was not to be  as their sentiments though not avowed re the result of nature i on eflection soon w weary of my soitary seat in the greenroom alone in a crowd and between the play and farce looked through a hole in the curtain and beheld an awful pleasing sight  a crowded splendid audience  such as might strike the boldest with dismay  the farce began and mr foot gained great applause and roars of laughter succeeded in the second act my time of trial drew near in about ten minutes i was called  mr wilkinson mr wilkinson  had i obeyed a natural impulse i was really so alarmed that i should have run away but honor pricked me on  there was no alternative  my brain was a chaos but on i went and must have made a very sheepish timid appearance as from fear late illness and apprehension i trembled like a frighted clown in a pantomime which foot perceiving good naturedly took me by the hand and led me forard when the burst of applause was wonderful and apparently that of kindness and true benevolence but it could not instantly remove my timidity and i had no prompter to trust to as all epned on myself  foot prceiving i was not fit for action said to his two friends on the stage seated like smith and johnson in the rehearsal this young gentleman is merely a novice on the stage he has not yet been properly drilled but come my young friend walk across the stage breath yourself and show your figure i did so the walk encouraged me and another loud applause cceeded i felt a glow which seemed to say what have you to fear now or never  this is the night that either makes you or undoes  quite and on the applause being repeated  to myself that is as loud as any i have heard  to mr garrick i mustered up  and began with mr luke sparks of lon brother to isaac sparks then in dublin in the character of capulet most of the gentmen in the boxes knew all the london payers and no play in london was so familiar te as romeo and juliet they were universaly struck with the forcible manner of the speaking and the striking resemblance of the features a particular excellence in my mode of mimicry a gentleman cried out sparks of london sparks of london the applause resounded n to my astonishment and the audience were equally amazed as they found something where they in fact expected nothing next speech was their favorite barry in alexander universally known and as universally felt i now found myself vastly elated and clever fear was vanished and joy and pleasure succeeded a proof what bametrs we are how soon elated and how soon depressed  when quite at ease i began with mrs woffington in lady macbeth and barry in macbeth the laughter which is the strongest applause on a comic occasion was so loud and incessant that i could not proceed this was a minute of luxury i was then in the region of bliss i was encored yet that lady had declared in london on hearing i was to go with foot to ireland  take me off a puppy  if he dare attempt it by the living g  d he will be stoned to death here the lady was mistaken for on repeating the part the second applause was stronger than the preceding a sudden thought occurred i felt all hardy  all alert  all nerve  and immediately advanced six steps and before i spoke i received the full testimony of true imitation my master as he was called sat on the stage at the same time i repeated twelve or fourteen lines of the very prologue he had spoke that night being called for to the author and he had almost every night repeated i before mr foot presented his other self the audience from repetition were as perfect as i was his manner his voice his oddities i so exactly hit that the pleasure the glee it gave may easily be conceived to see and hear the mimic mimicked and it really gave me a complete victory over mr foot for the suddenness of the action tripped up his dacity so much that he with all his effrontery sat foolish wishing to appear equally pleased with the audience but knew not how to play that difficult part he was unprepared the surprise and satisfaction was such that without any concluon the curtain was obliged to drop with reterated bursts of applause they are remarkable in dublin when pleased to continue applauding ill the curtain falls often not suffering the play to finish this was a compliment frequently paid to mr sheridan  foot once said to that gentleman very seriously my dear sheridan i wish you would relieve yourself of a great deal of labor and trouble  in what manner says sheridan do inform me and i shall be obliged to you  why says foot instead of richard the third act king henry in that tragedy  good god mr foot why should i relinquish richard where you are a witness i get such universal applause  give me your reason  o says foot the best reason in the world for if you will perform henry instead of richard the play will finish in the first act and the players may all go home in good time to supper  when the farce called tea was concluded i had great congratulations paid seriously and ironically mr foot affected to be vastly pleased but in truth it was merely affectation so differently do we feel for ourselves when ridicule is pointed at us but he said it was perfectly well judged to make free with him yet he did not think it very like himself for it certainly was my worst imitation but he rejoiced at my good fortune in truth mr foot got the cas not me what i did was for him as he acted on shares and the fuller the house the greater was his profit he was piqued and chagrined but as he had kept within no bounds himself and made free with all characters whatever stage pulpit bar public and private peculiarities benefactors patrons friends as well as foes he could not with any degree of sense appear displeased or censure me for what i had done but kept his resentment locked up for a more proper and convenient opportunity as he considered the repetition of himself in my imitations was to his advantage by the evident partiality the public had shown me he made himself therefore tolerably easy and may be truly said to have pocketted the affront  the conversation the next day particularly of all my eager partial friends was an universal cry of foot outdone foot outdone the pupil the master and this was greatly assisted by their agreeable disappointment for i do not believe any one of them however warm they might have been in their wishes for my welfare but trembled for the event they felt unhappy lest i should make a despicable attempt and be universally disapproved and then reflected within themselves good heaven what is to become of this poor youth what can he do for a subsistence after my performance from the success i had met with i could neither eat drink or sleep that night pleasant dreams i needed not my waking thoughts were so much superior  the tea was acted in regular succession several nights nay it was commanded by the duke and duchess of bedford his grace was at that time lord lieutenant  the rehearsal was repeated in which i performed the princess chloris being well dressed y likeness and serious acting alamode woffington procured me great applause though in so  a part let it be here considered that the itation was universally felt above and below as mrs woffington lad played three years in  her salary not less than  00 l per season and  benefits she was also very conspicuous at he head of the court party with which she had certainly no business to interfere but as scrub  it must be a plot because there was a woman in it and that party increased the heat of he patriots and in the end though it made her more public it all ended in the destruction of the theater and the banishment of the manager who relied on something better and secretly expected from courtiers promises that his greatness would rise from his destruction  but plays without his own learning might have taught him better  alas who wants not teaching  mrs woffington being so well known to all ranks and degrees was of infinite assistance to me as an imitator after the first night of my performance mr sheridan appointed me a salary of three guineas per week and requested with my approbation which was readily obtained that mr foot would write to mr garrick to grant permission for my continuance in dublin till the end of february foot was oblige to go to england with all speed as he had staid beyond his time but i was left behind waiting for mr garricks answer to mr sheridans request but which soon arrived and granted the petition requested by mr foot  before january expired i played cadwallader spoke the prologue and acted othello with much applause and credit to myself the latter was certainly a very bold attempt for by the bye barry had performed that his favorite character repeatedly two winters before mr king performed iago and miss g philips mrs jordans mother desdemona here it would be unjust and ungrateful in me not to reflect with pleasure on the great civilities and kindnesses which i received from mr and mrs king in that early stage of life there are different kinds of memories a good memory a bad memory and a convenient memory what i am going to reelate requires a bad memory as not proper to be retained but i insert it to please myself and being a sweet story will with it refresh the memory of my friend mr king  this said mr thomas king had set his heart on well preparing a new pantomime in order to give his manager mr sheridan a lift and it was advertised for the thursday but it was not fit for preparation on the wednesday it was called the whim or harlequin villager as mr king is and ever was indefatigable he was determined to be at the theater the whole wednesday night that he might be a spur to industry and observe that the painters carpenters etc were strictly at their duty and to make the time pass more pleasantly in his dreary mansion for a large theater certainly is so when only lighted with three or four pieces of candle and being a spot where murders of various kinds are weekly committed and where ghosts undoubtedly are known to stalk he therefore to cheer his spirits desired mrs king and myself to be with him in the greenroom we agreed but i made it conditional which was provided we had something to eat as well as to drink as muttonchops or beefsteaks he assented and mrs king agreed to cook them and i was to assist her about ten oclock wine rum and oranges entered the room and the muttonchops properly sprinkled with pepper and salt were placed in order on the wellrubbed gridiron which a servant set close to the fender waiting for further orders i complained of cold and the only seat in the greenroom was as usual benched round and immovable chairs were called for  two were immediately brought  i answered for procuring a third for myself  and recollecting mrs fitzhenrys dressing apartment was adjoining to the greenroom where i had seen an elbowchair and mrs fitzhenry as hermione sitting in her royal robes i went in the dark seized the chair by the elbows but when i brought it near the fireside by a sudden jerk off flew the bottom and o ye powers by the violence of the shock the regalia the treasures of queen elizabeth and cleopatra rushed like a golden tide over our muttonchops and bright gridiron reader turn the leaf and guess the rest or do not guess at all just which suits your fancy however for one hour it cured all complaints of cold or hunger while we retired the servants of the theater had the disagreeable trouble to assist to put the room in order which indeed required some patience and care to accomplish when the stable was cleansed eating was out of the question we had an excellent bowl of punch which proved salutary palatable and restored us to harmony and we passed two or three very cheerful friendly hours  early in february i received the following letter from my mother it may not be thought worthy attention to readers in general but every parent will be pleased with the genuine language of nature i shall therefore occasionally introduce a few letters as they occurred from a pattern of arental goodness to mr wilkinson abbeystreet dublin my dear tate i reckoned every day and hour until i heard how you got over so daring a part as that of othello is said to be which by the information of yesterdays letter from ireland i find you have executed beyond my expectation my wishes for all the joy pleasure and advantage in that way of life with unsullied reputation you may be assured of with the same from mr townsends where the account of this great character was as impatiently wished for as by myself it gives me great pleasure to hear you are looked upon as so considerable a person in dublin and am of your opinion that in all respects you will never find the stage again so much suited to your own humor  i dined yesterday in deanstreet with lady forbes the two miss wilsons there and the captain just come home we had a very good dinner and were all in good humor and very merry i got home by day to meet your letter then to mrs townsends with the contents  you dont say one word of mr and mrs chaigneau nor the kellys i take for granted they are all well and went to see othello the house at covent garden is quite forsaken and rich gives away his box tickets by the dozen  mrs davis has wrote that she will send snuff by you to lady forbes i would have you pay your respects there now and then as i believe his lordship to be what he professes beg you would present my most sincere and grateful respects in abbeystreet wishing a long continuance of good spirits and lasting satisfaction  i am your most affectionate mother g wilkinson london january         ps an impromptu by miss jones upon hearing that you played the part of cadwallader in the style of foot who was then acting the same part at drury lane  one night when sleepless in my bed garrick ran strangely in my head his legs so handsome  though they are short the mans just formed for play and sport hear a new wonder in his praise beyond a lear or matchless bays wide is the space by sea and land from drurys house to dublins strand yet in one instant i will engage a foot he will place upon each stage        it had not at this time been usual to have plays acted on saturday nights as they never had turned out beneficial or fashionable though put into practice when woodward and barry opened at crowstreet and from use soon became as good a night as any other for the manager but not i believe to this day as a benefit  the prevalence of custom is astronishing  a lady in london will go to a known bad opera on the saturday and though she professes being an amateur in music will not go on the tuesday though a good opera because it is tuesday a lady will go to the theater at edinburgh bath and york though to the most indifferent play and as indifferently acted on the saturday because it is saturday yet the best acted comedy shall be offered to the public at either of those three theaters on any other night and be totally neglected unless it is hinted that the night is to be fashionable which alters the case at hull the house would not even be a decent one to whatever play might be performed if it was a saturday unless the fashion at doncaster and wakefield there is not any material distinction as to nights  i am led to these observations by recollecting when in dublin on this my first excursion i judged it necessary early in february to wait upon mr sheridan in order to appoint a night for my benefit which had been stipulated to be in that month in consequence of my continuing with him mr sheridan observed that my being a young man and a stranger it could never answer for me to venture on the expenses of the theater the charge being forty pounds but at present sixty or seventy pounds per night but he had an expedient to serve me more effectually which was to permit me the privilege of disposing of tickets dividing the sum taken for those tickets between us and he would himself play and secure its being serviceable to me in fat this secret service of his playing he thought would make my strenuous friends pour in tickets and he ap great advantage by them and by his playing a great favor on a benefit make himself appear in an advantageous light and as generous humane and full of pity  his throne again  the necessity of a second abdication from he towering walls of crowstreet in terrorem ly rearing their lofty heads in stately   to this act of liberality i objected and with re degree of spirit abided by my express engagement though verbal and referred him to the  of my friends he now plainly perceived  would make him appear in a mercenary and on light therefore he gave up the point but  the same time observed mr wilkinson i cannot ge you a night in february unless you will ake a saturday and to this proposal from necessity i consented that article being settled he complained that i was not studied in farce parts to b of service to him which indeed was true and further observed that instead of the performers whom i had taken the liberty to bring into company where they were not he judged it would ave a better effect if i would exhibit the  of the performers where they actually were  introduce imitations of such as were at that very time acting in dublin i observed to him that i had not had leisure to have paid a sufficient attention to that company as objects for imitation it could not be the work of a week or a month besides were i capable if i should take that freedom they would most likely not only insult me but make it a plea to refuse acting for my benefit that argument seemed with mr sheridan to have but little weight he persisted angrily i then intimated that if i complied i hoped he would not have any objection to my using his name and that i did not do it of my own accord but had his express command for that purpose and further urged surely sir will they not think it unkind of the manager that he should order a satirical performance on them which they must feel and term a cruelty in their governor to inflict mr sheridan seemed much vexed said that what he had asked me to do was to get me applause and to serve me  not himself but he should by no means consent to my exposing the peculiarities of his actors and actresses under the sanction of his desire and approbation he wished it to come before the audience as a sudden surprise and as my own voluntary act and after that had been done he would have taken care to have had it so called for by the audience as to prevent a possibility of the performers anger being of weight sufficient to prevent its repetition and the more it vexed the actors and actresses the greater relish it would give the audience that i believe was too true  however i continued my objection but at last like a fool in the knowledge of mankind and the human heart a lucky bright thought as i judged r occurred to me and i said my good mr sheridan i have hit upon the very thing to establish myself as a favorite with you and the town he seemed all impatience to know what it could be my dear sir a thought has just entered my pate which i think will draw money and be of infinite service to myself what is it what is it says sheridan with the utmost eagerness  why sir says i your rank in the theater and a gentleman so well known in dublin on and off the stage must naturally occasion any striking imitation of yourself to have a wonderful effect i have paid great attention to your whole mode of acting not only since i have been in dublin but two years before when you played the whole season at covent garden theater and do actually think i can do a great deal on your stage with you alone without interfering with any other actors manner whatever  hogarths pencil could not testify more astonishment  he turned pale and red alternately  his lips quivered  i instantaneously perceived i was in the wrong box it was some time before he could speak  he took a candle from off the table and showing me the room door  when at last his words found utterance  said he never was so insulted what to be taken off by a buffoon upon his own stage and as to mimicry what is it why a proceeding which he never could countenance that he even despised garrick and foot for having introduced so mean an art and he then very politely desired me to walk down stairs this was truly on the second not the first floor it being more convenient for his communication with the theater from that part of his dwelling house i was obliged to march and really felt petrified with my bright thought which had turned out so contrary from what i had ignorantly expected mr sheridan held the candle for me only till i got to the first landing and then hastily removed it grumbling and squeaking to himself and leaving me to feel my way in the dark down a pair and a half of steep stairs and to guess my road in hopes of finding the street door  mr sheridans voice was deep and as oppositely sharp and i should not have disliked then to have put in practice what i proposed had he given leave for i was really perfect and ready to a reader this may appear insipid but any person who can well recollect mr sheridans manner ould be entertained to hear me in the proper vein relate it as much depends on that for there is a great deal in being in spirits  after that fracas he neither permitted me to play or spoke to me during my stay in ireland any own night excepted i fixed on jane shore and tom thumb for my play and farce on the night allotted me saturday february         mr chaigneau himself waited on mrs fitzhenry to request her powerful assistance in alicia to which request she kindly assented hastings by mr wilkinson shore by mr dexter  jane shore by miss philips alicia by mrs fitzhenry queen dollalolla by mr wilkinson hneamunca by miss g philips  at the bottom of the bill tickets were to be had of mr wilkinson at his house in big strand street for be it known that in three or four weeks after my recovering from my illness when in abbeystreet my good cheer round of friends and company occasioned me to keep very late uts the then bishop of lantaff lodged during the winter on the floor under mine the  i made on coming home and the added rumbling when got into my own apartment with d acting singing etc made the bishops lodging very uncomfortable to him he sent for the landlord and informed him my rehearsing in the day and the greater noise i made at night rendered him so uneasy that he was under the necessity of insisting on the young actors instantly quitting the lodgings or he would for he really had tried his patience to the utmost and could no longer submit to it the landlord per force waited on his next door neighbors mr and mrs chaigneau and informed them in full of this unfortunate alledgement of his grace and humbly hoped they would not be offended at his not continuing mr wilkinson as a lodger as he could not permit it without sustaining the loss of his good and generous bishop mr and mrs chaigneau laughed very heartily at the complaint agreed in opinion with the landlord allowed that he and the bishop were both right the latter having just cause for his stated objections at dinner at my good home where i actually was the king of the table mrs chaigneau with an assumed anger a humor peculiar to the irish only  my god tate i am mighty angry with you and faith you do not mind me  i can tell you illy chaigneau is angry with you too  upon my conscience i do not think you care whether we are or not but come my dear tate i will not make you uneasy  we are both joking so after explaining the landlords visit with an exaordinary bottle for me and the good mr william chaigneau and passing a happy afternoon with them and three or four intimates i concurred n thinking it right to settle about my disgraceful departure from my lodgings and neighborhood when mrs chaigneaus bright thought far super or to mine with mr sheridan was first to save tates money and next not to inconvenience themselves she said if you will not discredit our house as you have the bishops we have one in big strand street not let this winter and there is a man and a woman servant live in it   is decently furnished and it is kept well aired  ur own house which we live in you know is your eating house we look on you as our son  you cannot want any thing but tea for breakfast d such trifles this is friday i will send immediately all necessaries such as sheets table linen etc etc and all shall be comfortable by tomor night quit your lodging and do not by any means fail in leaving a respectful card to the bishop as i am certain you have been very troublesome to him or he would not have alleged such complaints against you for he declares he is not angry but you are a plague to him  these orders i obeyed  called at my house the sound of which pleased me much on saturday noon and was highly delighted and told the servant pompously i should not be at home till late as i was engaged to dinner and for the evening at mr george hamiltons in henry street with a large party we dined at five observe reader that the custom of dining in dublin was and is much later than in london very few if any person or persons in established trade there ever dine till three oclock but in general at four i kept my appointment at mr hamiltons and a happy day and evening i had i got home about three oclock in the morning proud and satisfied was i when conveyed in a chair to my new mansion where all seemed to be conducted with the utmost care and made comfortable for my reception  a merry day and plenty of good things had prepared me for sleep the dining room was spacious the bedchamber large the bed excellent and i laid myself down expecting a delicious repose to repair the fatigues of luxury to relate what follows may seem superfluous i need not add with a mind at ease i soon had the blessing of a sound sleep which to prince or peasant is most delicious well says techy impatience sleep and be d  d what is that to me why my waspish friend if you in any one point smatter of antipathy here bestow your pity on me i ask it as a charitable boon to my sufferings though it is possible you may laugh at me and i beg you will make some little allowance for what you do not feel but if you do smatter of the like sensation i am certain of your bounty i can be astonished how any man woman or child can faint at seeing a cat because a cat i am partial to and like as a companion another will faint at the smell of cheese a lady will shudder at a leg of mutton not being cut to please her and a thousand instances might be given of the weakness of human nature in such trifling matters yet they are in truth terrible to the persons who labor under the like unhappy prejudices and too often laughed at by the observers which is cruelty in the extreme for how can i reconcile to myself in conscience the being pleased with the terrors of  there on seeing a cat where i feel no uneasiness but on the contrary pleasure and yet i should be very angry indeed at any ones laughing at my horror if a rat was near me yet so composed are we all at what does not affect ourselves that it is  lamentable truth to say and we must all be sensible that these things are unavoidably so  that these unfortunate prejudices should be ened in their progress is an indispensable duty and lesson which it is true ought to be inculcated for our own sakes and the repose of others that antipathies are dreadful i think i can warrant prove and explain for a sword or pistol at my breast i do not think would prove so great an alarm to me as a rat would in my pocket or bed my distress on such an accidental misfortune would be attended not only with agonizing sensations but i verily believe immediate danger  to prove that fear is the result of nature i will observe that by my living on the banks o the thames in london for many years rats were as familiar as kittens to my sight nay more so for where i saw one cat i must have seen twenty rats at low water about the logs of wood lighters etc on a fine day they swarmed and toward evening it was their grand rendezvous my mother had the same prejudice i have heard her mention repeatedly that when she was near her time with me one day when dressed to dine out with company being near the top of the stairs a rat passed suddenly between her legs which alarm caused her immediately to fall from the top to the bottom and instead of visiting was put to bed extremely ill and judged to b in imminent danger whether that might b the original cause to ground these fears in me i cannot decide but am certain i am so  to return to my house in bigstrandstreet where i left myself fast asleep and thank god that sleep continued till within an hour of daylight but that hour seemed to me the longest and most painful i had ever experienced the fever and blisters on my ancles not forgot indeed we generally feel our present woes as the worst i was waked by a lump falling on my breast my first conjecture was that a thief was in the room and had placed his hand there i then thought by no more moving it might be a cat which refection was of great comfort and consolation and next like richard the third concluded it was but a dream and possessed heroism sufficient to start myself up in the bed and like our stage harry the eighth to cry out hough hough  which act of valor was no sooner performed than i was immediately saluted with the squeaking of vermin and their running up and down the curtains and over the d and under the bed i distilled almost to ly with my fears lay covered over head and ears not daring to call for assistance or feel for the string of the bell or even to move a limb  the rats i am convinced must have made that oom their constant nightly residence not having been used i suppose for above twelve months on my suddenly calling out and striking the bed those devils by such an unexpected alarm of danger must have been almost as much terrified for their preservation as i was for mine for had they as i have been told they will made an attack they would soon have conquered me their petrified foe what resistance immediate danger might have enabled me to perform i know not but as i feel at this moment on the relation i am certain the bribe must be enormous that could prevail on me to touch a living rat  when daylight had befriended me and the gentry had retired to their secret apartments i found the bell and courageously rung and called for the servants at last a lazy dirty figure made his appearance to whom i related my woeful tale but did not find it made any impression or called forth the falling tear of pity for all my nightly sufferings and when the dingy wowski his wife made her entree and had heard the particulars from her darling trudge they both laughed and thought it a very good joke the dusky lady only uttered o faith i wish i had been with these varmant cratures by my shoul i would have made sport for them by cutting them pace male however though it was sunday i got the upholsterer where i had lodged in abbeystreet to oblige me with a man to take the bed down and search even the ticken to see if any rats had taken refuge where a flea might have security or lodging i had all the apparatus moved into the dining room and a large cat from mrs chaigneaus was sent to be as a guard all holes and crannies whatever were stopped and as a proof of my politeness to the nhabitants i never even at noonday entered that fatal chamber without a previous knocking  this childish story will be condemned by all xcept such as unfortunately are liable to such unonquerable aversions  nor would i here have nserted it but from one motive  to engage as r as possible some pity and allowance from those who are so happy as not to be liable to such diagreeable sensations however trifling they may  thought for if a dungeon was my lot my first idea would be the ratholes some men there are love not a gaping pig me who are mad when they behold a cat masterless passions sway us to the mood of what we like or loathe    i have frequently heard of a pet cat but never yet of a pet rat  i once conquered prejudice so ar as to have familiarized mysel to a pet squirrel which certainl bears some resemblance though it is paying the frolicksome squirrel a shabby compment a pet muse has at times been happ cherished in a ladys pocket but never so particulrly described or authenticated for its renly and uncommon attachments as by the renowned general baron trenck in his late prussian romance printed within these three years and universally read  so now farewell to rats and mice and such small deer  and i hope for ever antipathies are as unconquerable as unanswerable john bull loves beef and pudding the frenchman soup the dutchman butter the scotchman haggess the irishman potatoes the welchman leeks and kid the italian macaroni and a urk what we find poison laudanum  it would unavoidably occasion inconceivable trouble to invite a guest of every tribe and nation to one table and possibly contrive the means to provide a avourite dish for every separate visitants palate for there are as particular and fixed aversions to our eatables as to different specis  i like cheese yet the friend at y elbow perhaps strong in constitution and naturally robust and spirited might faint at its being produced on the tble i can aer that cream sauce to a turkey with all my precaution and determination to a certainty spis my dinner  it is a feast that takes away my stomach  as i was lately speaking of my strandstreet stuation i will proceed with giving information that the approaching   th of ebruar seemed to proise being most prosperous from the exrtions of mr chaigneau lord forbes and my long list of more than common friends my boxes were rapidly taken and for want of places in that circle no less than seven rows of the pit were added and railed in at box prices which are the ame as in london indeed more as every shilling goes in ireland as thirteen pence mr chaigneau paid me forty guineas for tickets the hole receipt of the house not then so large as it was made by mossop after that time was    l d an overflow from every part of the theater gold tickets to a considerable amount not only from my friends and some persons of distinction but particularly from the gentlemen of the army over whom mr chaigneaus situation as principal agent gave him great sway and he paid personal sits every where for the purpose of serving me  jane shore has been already stated as the play on this memorable night but i have omitted the mentioning my own performance at that period lord hastings i believe was not much graced or honored by my assuming his chamberlainship together with his star and garter which did not receive from me any additional luster that could be possibly handed down to his successors with honor however i cannot blame my manager for not being well dressed the wardrobe it is true was not equal to equip a number of persons of fashion fit to appear at court on a royal birthday but with the managers consent and mr dexters approbation i wore mr dexters grand suit for particular occasions which was a new blue satin richly trimmed with silver looked very elegant and what was better fitted me exactly  mr dexter was the gentleman who appeared at drury lane in      in oroonoko with more than common expectation of great success and was in      noted as a leading actor in the heroes and fine gentlemen on smockalley stage i must say in justice to myself that i was perfect to the line if not to the letter consequently the play went smoothly on and i obtained applause of course from so numerous a set of friends mrs fitzhenry in alicia gave as was usual great satisfaction as i did to an extravagant degree when magnificently arrayed for queen dollalolla in tom thumb which obtained a continued roar as i played it as woffington and i certainly may be allowed to say the steadiness and earnestness of the imitation was at least equal to any modern professors attempt  the rapid step from my late illness extreme poverty and friendless situation had taken such a turn that with my coach tableacquaintance presents and great benefit i thought my fortune made and early in march with true felt gratitude not from that day week or month but never effaced to the present moment now including above thirtytwo years i took leave of my good friends in possession of two valuable gifts health and wealth  indeed to the wonderful care of these good and undescribable persons can i only attribute my existence and also my wealth as from that time till encumbered with the cares of my present unpromising and perplexed state i never knew in the course of several years the want of cash which state of happiness my after frequent visits to dubn made me as a young man in a kind of independence  early in life i envied theatrical monarchy and like most things when obtained i soon experienced like the wisest man that all was and is vanity and vexation of spirit and as gay says lifes but a jest and all things show it i thought so once but now i know it   with now   0l in that pocket which a very few months before contained only two guineas and which i then termed a treasure  but good god what a change  like a ten thousand pound prize to a cobbler the contrast nearly the same only with this difference the cobbler might have been in health and happy but i had been ill very ill and a povertystruck youth  i sailed from ireland with a fair wind attended by the waft of numberless good wishes for my safe arrival in old england  at chester i met young mr bagnal a gentleman of family in ireland and as i was become a man of fortune we traveled post like gentlemen and arrived safe in the metropolis i felt myelf in step air and mind a very different person from what i was when i left london  soon after my arrival i took leave of mr bagnal and presented myself with as much duty as pleasure to my dear mother as every son should and ought to do and am certain the return was overpaid by her her joy surprise and a thousand etceteras which may be supposed and only affectionate and good mothers can feel such heavenly sensations i do not speak from supposition but can aver that though there was is and ever will be good parents yet mine was really sprung from the tree called the nonpareil and i can with truth boast i possessed one truly praiseworthy quality and that was being one of the best sons not from any merit as a duty from myself due to my mother but because i loved and revered her worth and conversed with my true friend and what might be termed coldly that of duty did not create the groundwork only of my esteem for all i did sprung solely from selflove as making her happy was my inclination pleasure and delight nor do i mean by these protestations to convey merit in any extraordinary degree to myself for had she not been a sensible and an endearing mother i doubt whether my good behavior had been conspicuous beyond mediocrity the giving to her an account of my riches and my friends in ireland was a feast and my producing the   0l bill was a dazzling sight indeed though only in black and white letters  soon after my arrival i paid a visit to mr garrick who wished me joy though not in a joyful manner i gave him an account of my benefit etc and thanked him for his leave of absence the second saturday after my being in london as i had staid in ireland by permission only i went to the treasurers office for my weekly stipend of thirty shillings as stipulated in my article but which at that time would only have been twenty shillings as the season of lent was not expired  on my asking for my salary mr pritchard first treasurer and mr wood subtreasurer informed me that as they had not received any orders from mr garrick or mr lacey they dared not pay me and i could not as they apprehended have any right to it but would inquire what they were to do when they saw either of the managers i argued my right of payment was undoubtable by my article but of course was obliged to depart as i came neither richer nor poorer  a few days after i met mr garrick in bridgestreet who on seeing me instantly with upbraiding and severe terms accosted me for my being so audacious as he termed it to call at his office for money he added in a supercilious manner that i had met with a little accidental success in ireland a circumstance that never could happen again and he had from motives of charity obtained me a retreat to secure me from want of bread and i repaid his kindness with impudent assurance and ingratitude this sudden attack really alarmed me as i had still formed great hopes for my future success on mr garricks power and friendship from what he had so often professed though not yet put into practice in my defense i urged with the aid of truth that i had only been absent upon furlow and by his permission had only continued on the same granted authority not having presumed to stay in dublin though a severe and dangerous illness had intervened but under the sanction of that grant and having an article for that and the following year i esteemed myself much obliged to him but inwardly presuming on my right of article i could not in word manner or obedience in duty to myself give up a point i had so far engaged in with that great monarch but persisted that on my return to london and his theater i was every way entitled to my salary  he austerely answered had i returned as he exexpected i should in great distress his own goodness and feelings would have allowed me the salary but as i asserted a falsehood and was not in want my insolence deserved punishment for there was not any such agreement subsisting between us i all security and full of open conviction against him in the face of day not only asserted my right but hastily produced my bond which was worded thus on the back articles of agreement between david garrick and james lacey esquires and tate wilkinson gentleman for two years from october         here i concluded myself quite sure and of course felt as elate as any plaintiff on the gaining a verdict in his favor when after a look of disdain and a sneer of ineffable contempt mr garrick said thou foolish pert boy go home to thy mamma she can read though you cannot ook carefully over the contents of your article and you will there find that on the inside it does not commence till september      i of course had no occasion to ejaculate o upright judge but hung down my head and sneaked home to my mother when to both our astonishments it was really and truly as mr garrick had said this shows how careful people should be to read every thing before they sign and never to trust the seeming generosity and good nature of others the contents of the inside of this great and mighty article did not take place till the september following      how he could think it worth his notice to treat so insignificant an object as he termed me some months before in so mean so artful and so ungentlemanlike a manner i from that time to this could never devise unless through fear of my talents as an imitator he held me in a contemptuous light yet still ever watchful and careful in regard to himself he might perhaps think me worth retaining for a trifling salary as an exotic for his hothouse for he always used to term me his exotic therefore he chose to ock me up like a wild beast to prevent my distracting his repose or his consequence thus without salary was i obliged to remain and have recourse to my philosophy and sit down contented but being a man of fortune as i then thought myself i went on a visit to a new spot the fashionable city of bath to drink the waters having had an invitation from my friend mr hull my intimacy with that gentleman and miss morrison now mrs hull was fixed from our first acquaintance the summer before at maidstone from that time to the present i have ever been favored with their study to oblige and serve me which i have never yet had it in my power to return according to my wishes this acknowledgment i offer as a debt of honor and though not substantial my gratitude and good opinion could not let slip this opportunity of paying a tributary compliment to the merit of those particular and worthy friends  my first appearance at bath was on monday the  th of may      for miss morrisons benefit othello mr wilkinson from the theatreroyal dublin also mr wilkinson will treat mr foot with a dish of his own tea i was kindly received mr quin was at the play the imitations were well received but from my not being known on the stage and not having had the sanction of a london audience the applause was very different from what i had been honored with in dublin and what i afterward gained at bath when i had become more used to the stage by a variety of playing and the praises and applause of london had wreathed my brow with that all powerful phrase termed the fashion so prevalent is that word that even the siddons and the jordan bow to its shrine but a fickle jade is fashion and the first actress that thinks she is secure will at times find mrs fashion a shallow and inconstant friend  i gave tea for mr hull on wednesday the  0th of may and acted essex for the first time with cadwallader in the farce of the author for miss ibbott in the interim the families of the townsends and the hanways in london were all wellwishers for my mothers and my welfare and were ever devising ways and means to advance and establish my future success their tables when i was in london were my constant welcome places of resort while i was figuring away at bath for my own diversion from may without any engagement till september following at drury lane they were deliberating for my real prosperity much more than i could myself the townsends had at that very juncture major strode and his lady from portsmouth at their house on a visit major strode was the first in command at the portsmouth garrison at the same time there were a mrs arnold and miss arnolds her daughters from portsmouth also on a visit in london they were distant relations to the hanways my mother who was a frequent and a welcome visitor and indeed a desirable guest being at dinner at the townsends on a grand gala day and where the above ladies and gentlemen were present the good old lady mrs townsend with her genuine marks of benevolence and kindness desired a glass round to the health of her young friend and pupil for prayers tate wilkinson which was of course immediately assented to and complied with according to her wish this gave my truly good mother an opportunity to inform the worthy circle that after all the afflictions and misfortunes that had unremittingly pursued her through life she was she thanked the great being blessed with a son who made it his study to support her and to bestow every assistance in his power to render her latter days comfortable and easy they all agreed that being so good a son as my mother had described i deserved every praise and every encouragement  mr jonas hanway confirmed what my mother had related and they all joined in wishes for my success and a continuance of regard and duty being paid to her allowed worth after a short silence mrs strode broke out in the following exclamation  good god mr hanway a thought strikes me swift as lightning whereby we can with pleasure and ease to ourselves be of infinite service to tate  my mother of course bowed and gave eager attention as did every one at the hospitable table mrs strode proceeded with observing it was then a time of war between france and england may      and we have at portsmouth added she a glorious fleet for the honor of old england and the terror of france in consequence of which ou little garrison town is full of soldiers and sailors and all with plenty of money in their pockets which they cannot bear the thoughts of keeping there  as sailors in particular are never careful for the morrow  we have every year at portsmouth a company of players who travel also to plymouth and exeter a mr kennedy an elderly man is the manager of the company and he always makes portsmouth his summer place of residence the major herself and family should return there in a few days and when arrived at home would send for the manager and then make a point of her friend and old acquaintance mrs wilkinsons son being engaged for the summer season she also added her house should be my ordinary and from her intimacy with mrs wilkinson and her friend mrs townsend she would introduce tate to all her acquaintance and fattered herself she could answer that his jaunt to portsmouth by her contrivance and management should be profitable and pleasant with every reason for his satisfaction and none to occasion regret the party assembled added every assurance of patronage and support to the theater and had no apprehensions that my friends and merit could do so well as in dublin but they should prove a sample at portsmouth in a comparative view likewise to bast of this was no sooner said than done by mrs strode  all these wonderful and agreeable particulars it may be supposed were by the next post transmitted to me at bath with all the joy and heartfelt satisfaction and partiality of a fond mother i returned on the wing to her in london and got equipped with what i thought necessary for a ung gentleman not omitting a laced suit of thes which in those days were all the fashion and a rich gold laced kevenhuller hat and waited with impatience for my return of the portsmouth lttery ticket which proved no blank but a prize for mrs strode and the arnolds finished the business they had undertaken not like that of the laws delay for on their arrival at home it was no sooner mentioned than accomplished as when the theatrical troop arrived the manager was summoned to attend them and he was commanded not entreated under peril of their authority and the severe law in force to comply with mrs strodes mandate for that company of players did not want or approve of interlopers either to act the characters they possessed or to give any encouragement to strangers fearing if they did grant permission they might lead the inclination or the town into temptation and create an appetite for the london actors during their vacation for many london performers at such a critical time would not have disliked such a pleasant trip it being only seventytwo miles from the great city for health and profit  and they would have been refreshed with delightful sea breezes and the londoners once admitted would have diminished the fame as well as the profit of the devonshire and and hampshire candidates of the sock and buskin who basked in the sunshine of wealth at plymouth and portsmouth during the glorious war so called by the poor players like mr cumberlands jew who says the plague is a blessed circumstance and both for the same motive  selfinterest it was agreed i was to have a share as there was no distinction of emolument from romeo to the apothecary all received an equal portion likewise a clear benefit whenever i chose to appoint and was to act from friday the  th of june      until august the   th as often as called upon by the manager my being represented to him as a gentleman whom a large party of people of fashion were determined to support and not being sufficiently established as a performer to cause any grounds for jealousy in point of fame prevented any opposition from the company to hinder the managers compliance with the offer proposed for the noviciate therefore as it conveyed an idea of aiding their interests and a refusal would have occasioned much displeasure the preliminaries were agreed to and mrs strode wrote to mr jonas hanway an account of her success and summoned me immediately to portsmouth i received a letter of invitation couched in genteel terms from the manager and on this expected and wishedfor intelligence i set off with eager curiosity for the new scene of pleasure and what rendered it more enchanting to my youthful mind was a corrobroation of such happy events sudden springing up and snatching me from the brink of hopeless poverty and despair and all within the pace of seven months and as in a dream or enchantment was known and engaged in not only a polite circle of acquaintance but welcomed and eceived with such flattering aspect from every benign and friendly countenance that a stranger to have entered the room would really have supposed i had been a person of consequence in an enviable rcle happy happy minds that shed such sunhine and genial rays on the sons and daughters of affliction and as happy are those young ladies and gentlemen who are favored with such rays from superiors as to make them observant of not only manners but of what is really good youth of both sexes when treated so kindly are too apt to attribute it as a compliment to their own self superiority instead of truly feeling where the gratitude is justly due indeed i have seen so much of supercilious behavior on granting a favor and so many instances of affectation and selfsufficiency on receiving that i truly think and believe it would have been a difficult matter for one possessed of real genius to distinguish on which side lay the greatest absurdity  i arrived safe at the garrison but not without inquiries at each gate and drawbridge for my name and what was my business as the road from hillsey barracks to portsmouth is a continued chain of drawbridges etc i had not been housed three hours in this well guarded town when a capt chambers brother to sir charles chambers an old friend and intimate of my fathers and well acquainted with captain james jones formerly mentioned of the footguards and a captain scott of chester with three or four other officers came not only to welcome me but capt chambers as my late fathers friend in the name of all his brother officers gave me an invitation to constantly dine and sup with them at their mess i of course accepted of it and made a decent acknowledgment for the favor conferred but my heart felt much more man my tongue could express in short from the introduction of the strodes the arnolds and the officers my father having been universally known and i may add beloved by the gentlemen of the army i had such a general acquaintance that there actually were few houses in portsmouth but where i was received on the same footing as when in dublin and from my universal intimacy the streets seemed to become a part of my own fancied property  on friday june the  th i appeared in othello which part i had founded as mr hitchcock observes in his history of the irish stage on the manner etc i had observed and caught from mr barry and also gave tea the theater was crowded to a degree and had my performance been bad instead of tolerable it would have been attended with applause the tea of course was received with much approbation but i was fond of undertaking too much at one time either to serve my reputation as an actor or to the preservation of my health as a man for my constitution was never one of the strongest being racked at times from my youth to this day with a dreadful bilious complaint and an irregular life has encouraged that enemy every week to convince me of its pitiless power which pushes my feeble steps downward before my time from the pinnacle of fifty i must remark that as my reception was secure from my friends being present i should have consulted my own ease and have had patience to have studied better for my own advantage by giving more satisfaction to the audience and less trouble to myself but young performers have an idea of striking the observers with their various powers which is a wrong and dangerous experiment for instance it would have been more prudent for me to have acted othello only as a test of my abilities and reserved my tea to another night for the refreshment of my acquaintance  when i look over and recollect some of the nightswork i have gone through on the stage to my infinite fatigue it is wonderful i am existing to relate the particulars the study the labor and the bad hours i have ever kept considered indeed at this instant i feel my stomach painful which makes the observation occur that perhaps could i provide a better leg in exchange for my broken one i should not be surprised if in high spirits the following week i was to laugh at my own reflections and gravity so true is lord chesterfields remarks on our courage and our fears with every other sensation according to our habit of health custom and exercise from the same ought i imagine arises the saying ascribed by our soldiers of the americans they did not l bold on such a day however from my rst stage success i certainly was bit by a theatrical tarantula for my appetite for acting was insable illness unless verv severe never was a restraint for if able to crawl out of bed i have ten gone to the theater much disordered and if m performance has been received with applause ave returned home recovered and perfetly well on the contrary i do not know a more mortifying or disagreeable situation than to act to a poor  indisposed in health and to be only infferently received yet these unpleasing circumtances have happened to every performer from the ihest to lowest at particular times  it is the unaidable lot of human lie in all its stages if an atr or actress be really l those who are well uld lend every assistance in their power on such a emergency to serve the royal till and preerve the audience in temper not any thing sours a conregated assemblage of persons so much as frecet apologies nay the manager is often blamed m the pettishness of the audience because the erfrmer is sick and i am sorry to say i beieve  on such sudden disappointments is of refed not so much from ill nature in the dispsitn of the actor or actres as fear in the player of not being well received by the persons assembled together and besides yielding to a false pride and fancied selfimportance in the one so fixed on to supply the place of the sick performer which indeed might often be prevented if the audience would good naturedly support the actor or actress who in such a predicament undertakes the part however inferior his or her situation may be in a theater and they may by such kind assistance draw forth sparks of future greatness which may have been obscured by not having had an opportunity of displaying them and of receiving the sanction of the public  but let me crablike get back to portsmouth from which place i had not any right to have strayed but i fancy myself in these remarks and incidents as if i was speaking to some particular friend and if i cannot obtain great lenity pray in compassion to yourself good reader as well as to me close and drop the book for i neither possess wit or talents nor profess any such gifts as to furnish me with hopes of entertaining any one as a writer indeed i never had an idea or attempted any thing of the kind so i stand like hope wishing patience to be granted to every reader sprinkled with a few grains of good humor if any one ask why i now take this liberty i will honestly and frankly own that confinement occasioned by a broken limb has made the year very tedious wearisome and heavy therefore i sit and recall past joys and misfortunes to mv mind and as i know they are various i think they may please both friends and enemies for any hour that may hang heavy on their hands and though time is allowed as precious yet the wise people sometimes throw an hour away not to be bought back again at any price next i value myself on the authenticity of what i relate and pedge my truth and honor for the whole being a recitation of strict matters of fact only mrs bellamy averred the same but she took such pains to be untrue in her accounts that it could not be the effect of a bad memory as she hints but on the contrary labor and study to dress things so widely different from what they really were i would have set her right then and she mentions it in her sixth volume but she there acknowledges she is a bad chronologist  from what i have mentioned of my portsmouth visit it may be easily conjectured i was naturally not a little vain of my pleasant situation i played an extensive list of characters and it would seem incredible if not accounted for by my long reguar study and practice as a lad when mockmanar some i acted with merit and can truly say all with applause such is the happiness of being secure of the good will of superiors and obtaining a general kind opinion nay am certain at that time my youth and inexperience gained me such a partiaity from the families i was intimately acquainted with that they really fancied as i was a favorite among them that i was clever where indeed i was not and when glaringly wrong or imperfect would readily frame an excuse for me even against my own conviction of error  list of characters at portsmouth acted by mr wilkinson from june   till august          othello twice  romeo twice  hotspur  lord townly  richard iii   times  castalio  osmyn in the mourning bride  horatio hastings essex  lear four times  hamlet twice orestes twice farces cadwallader six times  ld chalkstone twice  petruchio tea ten times nb those marked with a  i had not acted before but it proves my industry to make myself well used to the stage  during my residence here i wished for a nearer view of the isle of wight for it had a tempting and beautiful effect from portsmouth ramparts the bath company were there at that time with them i had nearly engaged myself on the late trip to bath had not mrs strodes lucky thought intervened and put a stop to the business and a fortunate preventative it wa that and another escape of the same kind some years after makes it always recur to my mind as the peculiar care of providence indeed the portsmouth engagement was a lucky golden drop of madam fortunes in every respect  the bath comedians were induced to the isle of wight by the self same bait that at one time or the other seduces all mankind that is the love of lucre and which great ministers as well as great players ever have in view the bath company hearing from the clatter and the din of arms throughout the kingdom that an encampment of consequence was to be established for the summer and the ladies of that theater short legged and thick legged having a prediliction in favor of the knapsack all voted to pack up their tatters and follow the drum to the isle of wight nor are theatrical ladies singular in that particular indeed there needs no ghost to inform the world that females of all degrees to use a common expression set their caps at a red coat  their theatrical bath majestys therefore ordered a baggage wagon well loaded with armor foils truncheons spears daggers and all the implements of war were carefully packed up in case of danger to repel the french in their flatbottomed boats as well as to prove to the regiments how ably the female warriors were prepared to face the enemy the wagon was entrusted not only with all the theatrical wardrobe but with all their own private geer and that seriously speaking was a property of real value consisting of linen clothes jewels regalia etc to represent kings and queens of france and england spain portugal etc also emperors and empresses that never were or ever will be all these treasures and necessaries were safely stowed not forgetting the bones appertaining to hamlet calista etc their all was entrusted to the protection of a rude boorish wiltshire waggoner thunder and lightning not omitted but left to the care of the stagekeeper who undertook and said he was perfectly competent from constant practice to conduct and guide such troublesome and dangerous elements  thunder and lightning attended by a wonderful eclipse seldom pleases even on the stage except in the duke of buckinghams rehearsal where it always raises a laugh instead of a storm but lo the whole was destroyed by fre the first night of the waggons journey on salisbury plain this is not more strange than true mr keasberry now manager of the bath theater can testify the fact it was not occasioned by the elements above nor yet by the stage thunder and lightning but by the waggoners inattention and not endeavoring to save any part of the goods when the machine had taken fire and consequently as no water or any assistance was to be had all the property to a considerable amount was consumed  the distressed and harrassed troops mustered at newport where queen ibbot verified her favorite shakspeares words   a clout upon that head  where late a diadem stood they prepared as well as they possibly could to open their small theater in the little town of newport for then the players argument was too mournful to admit much talk  there were four or five regiments if not more encamped there the gentlemen of the army are in general theatrical and generous and these qualities never were more necessary than after that unortunate fire the gentlemen expressed an universal desire to make a compensation for their distress and indeed it might be reckoned incumbent on them so to have promised and acted as due to a debt of honor to make good their losses which happened in consequence of their desire to give these gentlemen entertanment who were so cooped up from their usual round of diversions and certainly so established a company as those of the bath theater to undertake so hazardous and so long a journey had a right to expect support and respect i went to pay my devoirs to them by taking a boat with only one man to row me across the arm of the sea which seperates hampshire from that charming romantic spot the isle of wight the afternoon was fine and serene i stayed with them two days and was highly satisfied with its rural beauties but on my return the sea ran very high and the wind blew a hurricane which alarmed me so much that i was really rejoiced when i got into ortsmouth and was greatly surprised when several gentlemen of the navy told me it was a very dangerous expedition and what not ne of them would have attempted except on necessity and duty but not on any means by way of a frolic  as one woe treads upon anothers heels as shakspeare observes so did another misfortune happen to my good friends mr keasberry and mr griffith for they had scarcely got their necessary repairs after the dreadful conflagration when as mrs inchbalds epilogue expresses down came an order to suspend the ball or in plain english they had been there but a very short time when orders came for the whole camp to break up and march for cowes and immediately embark on bord the shipping prepared for them at st helens and sail on a secret expedition against the french and as the town of newport could not without the assistance of the army provide or or by any means support the bath company so the players packed up their little all and sailed for outhampton and from thence repaired to reading in berkshire where they continued till the season for the uual opening of the ath theater  my benefit at portsmouth was n monday the   th of july the rovoked husband with tea and the part of cadwallader noting under full prie and by desire the gallery and pit all made one price a great house was of course expected indeed that season i do not remember there was a bad one tnerefore no need of the travellers talent to make it a wonder that mine was a great one  but will not the reader stare at such a piece of uncommon luck to happen and to come on a sudden burst for the command of the army was conducted so well and so secretly that we had not a notion or even a whisper of the kind of any such expectations on the wednesday but on the friday and saturday the town was crowded with officers etc  this occasioned a great house on the saturday july    not an usual night of playing and on sunday his royal highness the duke of york arrived and honored me with his company at the play on the monday where he favored me with much notice and as the saying is the whole world was there all at wilkinsons benefit whoever remembers that expedition planned against cherbourgh will know this account tallies to the day and the hour the theater and stage were so crowded that it was difficult to perform part of the regiment of his majestys guards with naval officers and those of several regiments and strangers innumerable with the marines etc all combined could easily have filled a london theater  the magnificent and powerful fleet added to every other brilliancy made the whole a glorious sight not that any ship pleased me more however gaudily dressed at spithead than our theatrical frigate so nobly adorned on my benefit night and to mark my singular good luck in three days they were all embarked the wind was fair and away they sailed for the glory of old england  my tea the night of my benefit was of great service not only there but was remembered and related as a matter of merit in the little village called london  colonel caesar of the guards mrs woffingtons defender and protector was at the play and saw and felt the force of my imitation of that lady  i was introduced to several gentlemen with whom afterward i was very intimate  it was at that time my acquaintance first commenced with the late general st ledger which continued till the year of his death he honored me with being my particularly attached and intimate friend as all my yorkshire acquaintance can testify the last dinner he had at his own house at parkhill i was with him by particular invitation as also capt smelt who accompanied him to dublin where death snatched away my friend and patron with the truly accomplished nephew of general st ledger an intimacy i cannot boast but can exultingly mention the honor of many favors and acts of kindness  not paid to my own deserts but by a compliment which originated from his certain knowledge that his uncle the late general st ledger was not only my patron but honored me with his friendship  one of the blessings i long for during my short remainder of life is that i may see that gentleman situated in rank and affluence equal to the princes friend and his own most sanguine expectations accompanied with many years to enjoy that prosperity with health spirits and increasing happiness let my situation be what it will i shall always rejoice at neverading larels circling the brows of colonel st ledger  colonel thornton of the yorkshire blues was also on the cherbourg expedition and wit whom i could boast the honor of continued friendship in london till i lost him as i did my general for death sweeps all colonel thornton was one of the most lively tavern friends i ever knew  after the combined circumstances of luck at portsmouth i returned with a full pocket all elated to london not having in the least a contemptible opinion of my own abilities success makes people vain and in truth without a touch of vanity little worthy would be reolved or done  without a spice of this said vanity performers would not have courage to sustain the shock and proceed  for at the best the stage has its bitters mingled with its sweets which cannot be known till tasted and experienced for surely no other profession can be so fikle and precarious indeed i know of no comparison compatible but a similitude to the most splendid situation in this world which is the court for notwithstanding the jump of difference and the seeming impertinence of the assertion it is certain that the ins and outs of courts with many etceteras leave no doubt of the resemblance being striking strong and apposite  my time in london till the house opened in september      being only three weeks was very pleasant and i was hiefly employed in relating my portsmouth adventures with a description of guns and drums and the wonders i had seen performed by the army and navy i had all the great names as familiar in my mouth as household words when by reflection my conceit was a little cooled i waited on my master garrick once more in a frock trimmed with goldlace which made him dart his eyes through my weak brain my first words after my salutation were sir what am i to make my first appearance in and when  for now i was not so timid and afraid of this lord of lords and ruler of princes as i was the year before when i acted as his groom and rode his hobbyhorse he was on this easy question so full of hum  s and ha  s and hey why now y s they now really i think  that finding nothing could come from nothing i very soon obliged him by retiring as i was certain he wished my absence and having pleased my youthful vanity by not having presented myself before him in such povertystruck habilaments as i formerly had done i may be allowed at that time to pronounce my conduct excuseable as it was boyish for i was not nineteen till the  th of november following  indeed he told me that day as he often had done that he hated exotics and i was one  but in a few days he sent me prince volscius in the rehearsal which i relished very well as i thought the run of the verse and the situation would fit in a striking manner for me to exhibit a likeness of barry and that i could make it have a sudden and entertaining effect on the audience but garrick certainly was in hopes i would return it as not thinking it of consequence and afford him an opportunity for anger which would have kept me at a distance and prevented my daring to be troublesome  on the morning the play of the rehearsal was called i was convinced the above conjecture of mine was right why hey now wilkinson says garrick  hey now what hey  a  i think now that you  why cross  now now here you you have sent this part now to this lad i must not trust him with this volscius you know i must have some steady person to depend on  packer now hey packer  for if wilkinson does it he will be at some of his d  d tricks and be taking off or some d  d thing or another  do cross take the part back from wilkinson and i will think of something else for him  volscius was of course taken from me and i retired amidst the sneers and laughter of his majestys company of comedians with garrick saying to them all did you ever now see such a d  d exotic he would have destroyed my whole play of the rehearsal and be d  d to him  here my greatness received a stab though not deservedly as it must be granted my ambition had not been insolent when contented with prince volscius for a first appearance as mr somebody on a london stage and what a falling off was it to have such contempt thrown upon the portsmouth roscius  indeed i was not ordered to wait in plays as in the preceding season but was quite unemployed yet i received my weekly stipend of thirty shillings regularly  early in october i met lord robert manners who was crossing jamesstreet covent garden and whom i had forgot to mention as one of our party at parkgate and holyhead on my journey the year before to ireland in dublin he was very kind to me and whenever we met in the park or in the street he always stopped or walked with me for eight or ten minutes chat  when i solicited lord harcourt some few years ago to intercede with his majesty for a renewal of my york and hull patents i was highly favored by my fellow traveller lord robert manners for the permission he gave me of his name to lord harcourt he saw me twice in his ittingroom below stairs in grosvenorsquare he declared he could chat but he could not write he was a picture of reverence and decay for he had dignity to the last but death seemed entirely to have full and fast hold he assured me he saw no visitors therefore this permission was the more kind he complained of excruciating agony and in a very short time after that worthy friendly brave sldier and nobleman departed this life  on lord robert manners stopping to speak to me in jamesstreet after one of our usual chats he wished my success in london might equal that of dublin and we parted but he had no soonr left me than as i was pursuing my walk a strong voice issued from a iningroom window with great vehemence calling out  wilkinson wilkinson wilkinson  i looked round and soon spied my master foot as he was termed  his having treated me so very inhumanly during my illness in ireland and not having heard he was then engaged at drury lane had determined me from the time he quitted dublin never to trouble myself as to any future intimacy or acquaintance with him but lifes chapter of accidents is so various and hangs by such nice threads that there is no directing being directed or advised for the best it would certainly have appeared very rude not to have complied with so smiling and earnest a summons and after ten minutes conversation all my slights and wrongs were forgot and forgiven and sure if ever one person possessed the talents of pleasing more than another mr foot was certainly the man i can aver in all my observations that i never met with his equal mr garrick whom i have dined and supped with was far inferior to him in wit or repartee as indeed were persons of rank and degree for nature bestows not all her graces on the great or the opulent mr foot was not confined to any particular topic he was equal in all religion law politics manners of this or any age and the stage of course indeed a polished stranger would find it rare to meet with so many agreeable qualities for the conviviality of any company so combined as in a society with mr foot this is not the tribute of flattery to his memory but a piece of justice my own impartiality demands for it would be despicable indeed to point out his foibles and not be ready to attest his good qualities as a wit he is too well remembered and far beyond my abilities to describe as a blemish to his entertaining and improving qualities i must as a relater of truth remark that all these shining talents did not dazzle or answer the eager expectation unless he himself was the sole object of every directed eye for if a man of genius i will suppose a murphy or a henderson had slipped in a good story or had given any entertaining information and thereby gained the approbation and merit of the flowing souls foot not only immediately felt lessened but could not easily recover his chagrin and jealousy and the instant the guest had taken his leave and departed he could not help expressing himself with great contempt and asking the person or persons remaining if they had ever heard such d  d nonsense as that man had been uttering and added expressions of wonder why the hounds at table should be entertained with such absurdity but indeed to give the just picture i must add as a true historian  had the company left him in the best humor those very spirits were only reserved for the exposure of each persons failure or particular manner and which most people more or less have as a certain appendage tagged to human nature nor did that happen in a less but even in a stronger degree to himself for his own peculiarities were more extravagant than any persons whose gait or gesture or history he might choose to record or divert himself with and if not given immediate credit for what he asserted against the absentee he would vigorously fly to his happy reserve of neverfailing fiction which was veiled under such an appearance of truth aided by wi humor and great vivacity that he generally made converts who from irresistible impulse obeyed his laughing mandates it was policy to defer as long as possible quitting the room where he was monarch as it was certain the instant of any ones exit without loss of time to be served up raw or roasted to the next comer and that without mercy although the person had on the hour of his adieu conferred on mr foot an obligation of the utmost necessary service this idea cannot be better exemplified than by mr murphy in his excellent and entertaining comedy of know your own mind  the speech runs thus  could not you stay till my back was fairly turned   my trait of mr foot is true and i think i may assert when mr murphy wrote that line he wrote it as if foot had at that instant been at his elbow  mr foot possessed with all these foibles mingled excellencies generosity and humanity but vast ostentation was annexed to them his table was open  e loved company at that table and if they pronounced his wine had a superior flavor you could not have drank too much or could he himself ave been gratified till he had produced his clat of the best vintage  ow garrick was always on a fidget eager for  tion and adulation and when he thought  free and adored would prattle such stuff s ould disgrace a child of eight years old in conversation with its admiring and doting grandmamma his hesitation and never giving a direct answer arose from two cause  affetation and a fear of being led into promises which he never meant to perform and therefore by  nay  why  now if you will not  why i cannot say but i may settle that matter and as i shall see you on tueday why then  hev you know that  but mrs garrick is waiting  and you now  i say nw  hey  now tuesday you will remember uesay  as to money he seldom when walking the streets had any therefore could only lament his inability to give to a distressed supplicant but if greatly touched  why holland or any other person that was with him cannot you now advance halfacrown and be d  d to you which if holland did was a very good joke and for fear of spoiling the jest he never paid holland again as to his vulgar vein of humor which really deserves no other epithet when i was to perform the part of bajazet i shall in time and place take the liberty to relate one strong proof though i confess i think it too gross to mention and therefore it requires an apology and if it falls into a fair ladys hand i give a long warning no less than twelve months and request she will take sir clement flints advice in the heiress and skip over the leaf i would wish to avoid meanness abuse or falsehood and give an exact and candid trait of mr garrick and mr foot with their shades but by no means to obscure their lights and good qualities and hope i shall prove my words on the examination of the sum total and that my readers will say my accounts are given in like a just steward and with those gentlemen and myself the reckoning shall be fairly balanced  i must beg pardon for having left mr foot so long a time waiting in his dining room in jamesstreet he eagerly repeated his astonishment at not having seen or ever heard from me he was quite anxious to know what i had been doig since he last saw me in ireland and what and when i was to appear at drury lane not having a doubt of my success let the charaer be what it would he had the repeated pleasure of meeting with his friend colonel thornton since his return from the late expedition against cherbourgh who told him that he was acquainted with me at portsmouth and had been much entertained with my performances at that theater mr foot insisted on my staying dinner which invitation i could not refuse after dinner and while the glass was circulating he intimated a wish i would make my first appearance at drury lane as his pupil in a farce he had newly furbished up and titled the diversions of the morning and added you must wilkinson plainly see and be convinced that dirty hound garrick does not mean to do you any service or wish you success but on the contrary he is a secret enemy and if he can prevent your doing well be assured he will i know his heart so well that if you give me permission to ask for your first attempt on his stage and to be in my piece the hound will refuse the moment i mention it and though his little soul would rejoice to act richard iii in the dog days before the hotest kitchen fire for a sop in the pan yet i know his mean soul so perfectly that if on his refusal i with a grave face tell him i have his figure exactly made and dressed as a puppet in my closet ready for public admiration the fellow will not only consent to your acting but what is more extraordinary his abject fears will lend me money if i should say i want it this i must own seems a severe picture but the traits are from the life and a true delineation of character from which a person who had not been acquainted with mr garrick might be led to suppose he was a weak man but it was far from being really the case for his understanding and quickness of comprehension with fire and vivacity were infinite yet at repartee foot having the advantage he sunk in comparison but his real penetration far exceeded mr footes and his great caution had brought on the hey  now  what etc  but reader i shall be in a better humor with him by and bye and he with me where of course i shall think he appears to more advantage however that bask of sunshine did not last but changed like april and was inconstant as the wind foot never was in awe of garrick but ever treated him with the most cutting satire and well knew the way to profit from garrick was by always acting on his fears mr murphy used frequently to treat garrick in the same manner if he expected to obtain justice when connected on matters of theatrical business and indeed mr murphy continued a teaser to the roscius till the year of his death whenever he met him in company if i have uttered a falsehood i beg mr murphy will correct me whom i have not seen since february      at which time he conferred an obligation and related a whimsical story of their meeting in a mixed company where mrs garrick and miss moore the authoress were of the party however strange it may appear though garrick made avarice his idol yet fear was so predominant to preserve his fame so all alive that his own shadow if he thought it obscured his greatness would be sufficient to alarm and distu his nights repose  with very little thought i assented to mr footes proposal which i just now mentioned of playing in his farce and verily believe if i had not that i never should have had an opportunity of appearing on drury lane stage unless in some part totally unfit for me when mr garrick would have said and published he had really out of charity done all he could to serve me but found it was impossible to make any thing to the purpose of such a blockhead i should then have been discarded and what would have been more fatal pope garricks denouncing damnation would of course have rendered all my struggling for fame in vain for as sancho says  give a dog an ill name and hang him  end of the first volume
