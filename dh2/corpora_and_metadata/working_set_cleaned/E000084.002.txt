fredericksburg the   st jany      honble sir i wrote to your honor yesterday  since which your favor of the   th is come to hand i am greatly distressed to know what conduct to observe with regard to the indians that are coming to our assistance i would notwithstanding the ill state of health i am in go directly to winchester coud i flatter myself that the service woud reap any real advantage from it but as i am not entrusted with the management of indian affairs farther than directing their warroutes and even here they are governed by caprice and whim rather than by real design i am of opinion i should only share in mr gists embarrassments without rendering him the desired assistance because if he informs me rightly he is in no wise prepared for the reception of such a party either with arms or proper goods and how he can be timely supplied with either i know not but this i am certain of that were i on the spot all their disappointments   would be attributed to me as they look upon the commanding officer to be culpable in all those cases never was any thing more unlucky perhaps than these indians coming at this time having very little to apprehend and the season being too rigorous to admit of incursions into the enemys country if they were sent out to war it is more than probable that they would return to their nation as soon as they came in by which means we should need their assistance in the spring when they would be of infinite service in offensive or defensive measures and to feed and clothe them thro the winter if they could be prevailed with to stay would be attended with great expence upon the whole it appears to be a very ill judged step the sending them in at this time and an affair of so much importance that i do not care to meddle in it without particular instructions from your honor i have dispatched a special messenger to mr gist apprizing him of this matter and shall wait at this place for your orders as to my own conduct i am c    george washington   march      mount vernon colonel stanwix to colonel stanwix mount vernon   march      my dear colonel your favors of the   th january and the   th ultimo with the extract of a letter from lord loudoun were this day delivered to me in the latter you condescend to ask my opinion of major smith pray does not his plan sufficiently indicate the man can there be a better index to his abilities than his scheme for reducing the enemy on the ohio and his expeditious march of a thousand men to detroit surely he intended to provide them with wings to facilitate their passage over so mountainous and extensive a country or what way else could he accomplish it in i am unacquainted with the navigation of the rivers he proposes to traverse and consequently cannot be a competent judge of his scheme in this respect but the distance is so great and that through an enemys country that i candidly confess it appears to me a romantic plan in general that may exist in the imagination but cannot be executed for if we are strong enough to attempt the reduction of the ohio what necessity is there for our making such a circuitous march and leaving fort duquesne behind us which is the source from whence flow all our ills and if we are too weak to attempt this place what have we not to dread from leaving it in our rear these sir are my sentiments upon major smiths plan with regard to the person if i have been   rightly informed he actually had a commission to command a ranging company and obtained it by making promises he never could comply with he was adjudged by persons better acquainted with him than i am to be quite unfit to command even a company and lost the blockhouse in which he commanded by suffering his men to straggle from it at pleasure which the indians observing took advantage of his weakness and attacked him at a time when he had no men in his works it is nevertheless agreed on all hands that he made a gallant defence but i never before heard of any capitulation that was granted to him i have not had the pleasure of seeing major smith though i have been favored with a letter from him in which he politely professes some concern at hearing of my indisposition as it prevented him from seeing me at winchester but desires at the same time that i will attend him at his house in augusta about two hundred miles hence or in williamsburg by the  0th instant when i suppose he intends to honor me with his orders  i have never been able to return to my command since i wrote to you last my disorder at times returning obstinately upon me in spite of the efforts of all the sons of æsculapius whom i have hitherto consulted at certain periods i have been reduced to great extremity and have now too much reason to   apprehend an approaching decay being visited with several symptoms of such a disease i am now under a strict regimen and shall set out tomorrow for williamsburg to receive the advice of the best physicians there my constitution is certainly greatly impaired and as nothing can retrieve it but the greatest care and the most circumspect conduct as i now have no prospect left of preferment in the military way and as i despair of rendering that immediate service which my country may require from the person commanding their troops i have some thoughts of quitting my command and retiring from all public business leaving my post to be filled by some other person more capable of the task and who may perhaps have his endeavors crowned with better success than mine have been but wherever i go or whatever becomes of me i shall always possess the sincerest and most affectionate regards for you being dear sir your most obedient and obliged humble servant    george washington  0 april      fort loudoun brigadiergeneral stanwix to brigadiergeneral stanwix fort loudoun  0 april      dear sir permit me—at the same time that i congratulate you which i most sincerely do on your promotion you have met with and justly merited—to express my concern at the prospect of parting with you i can truly say it is a matter of no small regret to me and that i should have thought myself happy in serving this campaign under your immediate command but every thing i hope is ordered for the best and it is our duty to submit to the will of our superior i must nevertheless beg that you will add one more kindness to the many i have experienced and that is to mention me in favorable terms to general forbes  if you are acquainted with that gentleman not as a person who would depend upon him for further recommendation to military preferment for i have long conquered all such inclinations and serve this campaign merely for the purpose of affording my best endeavors to bring matters to a conclusion but as a person who would gladly be distinguished in some measure from the common run of provincial officers as i understand there will be a motley herd of us   nothing can contribute more to his majestys interest in this quarter than an early campaign or a speedy junction of the troops to be employed in this service without this i fear the indians will with difficulty be restrained from returning to their nation before we assemble and in that event no words can tell how much they will be missed it is an affair of great importance and ought to claim the closest attention of the commanding officer for on the assistance of these people does the security of our march very much depend there should be great care taken also to lay in a supply of proper goods for them the indians are mercenary every service of theirs must be purchased and they are easy offended being thoroughly sensible of their own importance upwards of five hundred are already come to this place the greatest part of whom are gone to war many others are daily expected and we have neither arms nor clothes proper to give them nor indeed is it reasonable to expect that the whole expense accruing on account of these people should fall upon this government which hath already in this as well as in many other respects exerted her utmost abilities for his majestys interest and in the present case shares only an equal proportion of the advantages arising from indian services these crude thoughts are hastily thrown together if you find any thing contained in them which may be useful be pleased to improve them for his majestys interest the latitude which you have hitherto   allowed me joined to my zeal for the service has encouraged me to use this freedom with you sir which i should not choose to take unasked with another if it is not inconsistent i should be glad before i conclude to ask what regular troops are to be employed under brigadiergeneral forbes and when they may be expected also where they are to rendezvous fort frederic i hear is mentioned for this purpose and in my humble opinion a little improperly in the first place because the country people all around are fled and the troops will consequently lack those refreshments so needful to soldiers in the next place i am fully convinced there never can be a road made between fort frederic and fort cumberland that will admit the transportation of carriages for i have passed it with many others who were of the same opinion and lastly because this is the place fort loudoun to which all indian parties either going to or returning from war will inevitably repair i am with most sincere esteem dear sir your most obedient and obliged humble servant george washington    april      fort loudoun francis halket to major francis halket fort loudoun    april      my dear halket are we to have you once more among us and shall we revisit together a hapless spot that proved so fatal to many of our former brave companions   yes and i rejoice at it hoping it will now be in our power to testify a just abhorrence of the cruel butcheries exercised on our friends in the unfortunate day of general braddocks defeat and moreover to show our enemies that we can practise all that lenity of which they only boast without affording any adequate proofs at all to cut short i really feel a degree of satisfaction upon the prospect of meeting you again although i have scarce time to tell you so as the express is waiting i am with most sincere regard dear sir yours c george washington    april      fort loudoun to the president of the council fort loudoun    april      honble sir an unlucky but unavoidable accident happened in the neighborhood of pattersons fort the other day the proceedings of an examining court of officers on that occasion which are herewith sent will bring your honor acquainted with the circumstances i caused a very strict enquiry to be made into the conduct of mr chew that equal justice might be done to the dead and to the living and it appeared that mr chew had acted with great spirit and activity in pursuing the tracks of those people and that in shooting them altho it was unlucky in the event he had done nothing that was not strictly warrantable lane and cox appearing both in dress disguise and behavior to be no other than indians  0 i think it incumbent on me to be informed by your honor how the regiment under my command is to be furnished with tents ammunition cartridgepaper and many other requisites that may be wanted in the course of the campaign we expect it is here to be furnished with all those articles from his majestys stores but it is necessary for me to learn this from your honor captain joshua lewis of the virginia regiment has applied to me for leave to resign urging as a reason that his interest lies in the navy and if longer neglected it may be very detrimental to him he has therefore obtained my consent to do so and my promise of mentioning the thing to your honor captn thomas bullet will in this event by seniority succeed to his company which with the death of lt milner and the removal of mr wm henry fairfax to the northward cause two or three vacancies to be filled up i hope by the volunteers who have served for that purpose and some promotions of ensigns to lieutenants which will require at least half a dozen blank commissions i therefore beg the favor of your honor to send them to me and you may depend that in filling them i shall have strict regard to justice and will act conformably to the rules of the army i have at this time four or five blank commissions of govr dinwiddies signing but they are now useless the last assembly in their supply bill provided for a chaplain to our regiment for whom i had often very unsuccessfully applied to governor dinwiddie    i now flatter myself that your honor will be pleased to appoint a sober serious man for this duty common decency sir in a camp calls for the services of a divine and which ought not to be dispensed with altho the world should be so uncharitable as to think us void of religion and incapable of good instructions i now enclose a monthly return for march and am honorable sir your most obedient humble servant george washington    april      fort loudoun sir john st clair to sir john st clair fort loudoun the    april      sir your letter of the   th addressed to captain bullet came to my hands about an hour ago i have not words to express the great pleasure i feel at finding general forbes and yourself so heartily disposed to please the indians who are our steady friends and valuable allies  mr gist will send you a return of the number of indians who have come to our assistance—of what nations they are composed how many are gone to war and what number is yet expected in and i shall enclose you a return of the virginia regiment for the month    of march last the indians seem hearty in our cause and full of spirits at the prospect of an expedition which they have long been wishing for but i fear the rendezvous of the troops at the mouth of conococheague will give them some disgust because from long use this place is become perfectly known and familiar to them and it is here they repair upon every occasion here also all their scouting parties that are gone to war will return and at this place the earliest intelligence of occurrencies on the frontiers will always arrive i have taken great pains to encourage all that have gone to war since my return here to take each a prisoner and if they should get more than one to keep them asunder which they have promised to do  that part of your letter relative to the building flats i have communicated to lt smith and we shall endeavor to get plank and other materials in readiness but at the same time i must observe that all the men of this garrison are employed by authority of this government in finishing the works here and i do not know how far my conduct may be justified in withdrawing them from them as i have received    no order from the president to regard any instructions but his own i now flatter myself that this settlement will be able to furnish a pretty number of waggons  willingly but what quantity of forage may be had i am unable to say i have however made your desires known to the people on this occasion i have advice that our assembly have voted  000 men for the expedition who are to be commanded by general forbes besides militia for the security of the frontiers and that they have also voted an additional fund of £ 000 for indian expences  your express with letters of the  th came safe to this place on the   th in the evening and was dispatched early next morning i am c george washington    april      fort loudoun to the president of the council fort loudoun    april      sir your letter of the   th instant intended to come by colonel stephen was delivered me today about noon by express as there are several matters contained in it of an interesting nature i chose to be    aided in my determinations by the advice of my officers and have enclosed your honor their and my opinion on the several heads i could by no means think of executing willingly that discretionary power with which you were pleased to invest me of ordring out the militia  it is an affair sir of too important and delicate a nature for me to have the management of for much discontent will be the inevitable consequence of this draft your honor will no longer be at a loss for a return after you receive my letter by jenkins and lest any accident may have happened to that i herewith enclose another for the same month when the relief of our outposts in augusta marches major lewis who commands on that quarter should be advised thereof and he will order them to their stations that was a most extraordinary request of colonel mercer concerning the exchange of officers and calculated it would seem rather to breed confusion and to gratify his own vanity than to benefit the other regiment  there is not an ensign there that would not rather quit the service than accept of a company in the other regiment so much do they disapprove    colonel mercers proposal and i have neither inclination nor power to force their compliance captain rutherfords company was raised and posted on this quarter by governor dinwiddies express orders and can be more useful here than any other men whatever being all sons of the neighboring farmers men of property young active and entirely acquainted with the woods on these frontiers whereas if they go to the southward they will be utter strangers to the enemys haunts and of no more use there than the militia of an adjacent county while their places here must be supplied by militia equally ignorant of these woods as they will be of any others besides giving them a useless march of two hundred miles and exposing the frontiers in the mean time another reason may be urged their property all lies in this county interested motives induced them to enlist and to be vigilant in defending it and i believe they would desert rather than go to the southward your honor will please to remember it was one among the last questions i had an opportunity of asking if i should send parties a recruiting you replied that as the assembly was so near meeting you would defer giving any directions on that head and as i had no money for the purpose i hope it will not seem surprising that we have recruited but a few men since and that i have been waiting for orders to complete the regiment i shall now use my best endeavors with what few officers can be spared from    the garrisons which will be very few indeed dispersed as we are i shall also be under a necessity of sending down for money to carry on this service and should be glad that your honor would order it to be ready immediately to prevent delay of the officer who will set off tomorrow or the next day after at the farthest i am c george washington   may      fort loudoun to the president of the council fort loudoun   may      honble sir the enclosed letter from capt waggener will inform your honor of a very unfortunate affair from the best accounts i have yet been able to get there are about  0 persons killed and missing immediately upon receiving this intelligence i sent out a detachment of the regiment and some indians that were equipped for war in hopes of their being able to intercept the enemy in the retreat i was fearful of this stroke but had not time enough to avert it as your honor will find by the following account which came to hand just before capt waggeners letter by captn mckenzie lieutenant gist with   soldiers and  0 indians marched the  d of april from the south branch and after a tedious march occasioned by the deep snows on the mountains got on the waters of the monongahela where mr gist was lamed by a fall from a steep bank and rendered incapable of marching the white people and some of the indians remained with him and the rest of the indians divided themselves into three parties  separated    ucahula and two more went down the monongahela in a bark canoe and landed near ft duquesne on the north side where they lay concealed for two days at length an opportunity offered of attacking a canoe in which were two french men fishing those they killed and scalped in sight of two other canoes with french men in them and came off safe when he got about    miles on this side ft duquesne he came upon a large indian encampment from the size of which and the number of tracks judged to be at least  00 making directly for the frontiers of virginia as they again discovered by crossing their tracks  at present i have nothing more to add to your honor having written several times lately on matters to which i have received no answer i had wrote thus far and was going to send off an express with this melancholy account when i received    advice that the particulars relative to those murders had been transmitted from augusta to your honor i thereupon thought it most advisable to postpone sending till i should receive answer to my several letters by jenkins and mr gist which i was accordingly honored with the  th and last night may  0th after due deliberation on your honors letter of the  d by gist i am of opinion that the number of militia you have ordered for the defence of the posts to be evacuated by the regiment will be sufficient unless the completing the works at this place should be thought necessary as it can not be supposed that the enemy will attempt any formidable incursion after the march of our army and as to the depredations to be feared from their small scalpingparties it would be out of the power of thrice the proposed number or indeed of any number effectually to prevent them but as you are pleased to desire my opinion—i beg leave to offer a few things relative to the disposition you propose i humbly conceive therefore that it would be infinitely more for the interest of the service to order the  00 from prince william to the south branch and continuing rutherfords company in its present station making this its headquarters for as that company is perfectly acquainted with all that range of mountains extending from the potomack to the augusta line and thro which the enemy make incursions into this settlement they could with greater    facility obstruct their inroads and assist the inhabitants of this valley of whom they themselves form a very great part than those who are ignorant of the ground the militia from prince william equally know the branch and this vicinity and therefore may be supposed to do as much there as here whereas moving rutherfords there would be stripping them of those essential advantages which they may derive from their thorough knowledge of these parts and removing them from defending their immediate rights the sole motive of the enlisting one half of this company were it continued here might be constantly ranging and the other left in this fort which is centrical to their present station if the works here are to be completed which from their great importance i should think highly necessary in that event an additional number of  0 or  0 good men from the militia for that particular service would be wanted and i do not know any person so capable of directing the works as major joseph stephen of caroline county he formerly had the overlooking of them and managed with remarkable industry a part of the militia ordered for the branch should take post at edwardss on cacapehon and at pearsalls for the security of convoys passing from hence to fort cumberland i really do not know what method can be practised to compel the country people to deliver up the public arms unless there could be a general search in every county  0 governor dinwiddie if i remember right issued two or three proclamations ordering them in to no purpose with regard to opening the roads i think it would be most advisable to postpone all attempts till sir jno st clairs arrival as he is expected so soon for pearsalls altho it is the most convenient road for the virginia may not be used by the northern troops as i understand their rendezvous is ordered at fort frederick in maryland this may also altho i cannot yet absolutely say render garrisons at edwards and pearsalls useless unless it be a few to preserve the forts and the families gathered into them as several of our best sergeants were made officers in the carolina regiment besides some other vacancies in that rank parting with  0 for the use of the new regiment will be a very great hardship at this juncture we are likewise short of our number of drummers and many of those we have are raw and untutored as the general expects not regularity from the new levies well knowing how little any attempts towards it in a short time would avail i can not help being surprized at their requesting your honor to give directions for doing what would be of no real service to the new regiment and would be of vast prejudice to that i have the honor to command in consequence of your orders for completing the regiment with all possible despatch by recruiting i sometime ago sent all the officers i could spare to    those parts of the country where there is the greatest probability of success and furnished them with all the money i had and directions to draw upon me for whatever sum they might want for that service i likewise engaged some of the most popular of the country gentlemen to recruit for me giving them the same liberty to draw upon me well knowing the difficulty of getting any tolerable number in a short time i exerted myself in prosecuting every measure that afforded a prospect of success having then not the least reason to doubt of being duly supplied with money but how great is my surprise at that paragraph of your honors letter that you can not send me any for that service as i had immediate demands upon me which i put off until mr gists arrival i consulted with my officers about applying the £ 00 sent for contingencies towards these demands and enclose you their opinion on that head and i must earnestly request that you will be pleased to fall upon some measures of sending me  00 or  000£ more as your honor the honor of the colony as well as mine and the officers together with that of those gentlemen abovementioned whom i have employed is so nearly and immediately interested in the completion of those engagements which i have in consequence of your orders entered into surely it cannot be imagined that i can pay the money if i had it to deposit out of my own private fortune nor does the shortness of the time nor the circumstances i am under admit of any other alternative i will chearfully bespeak and can easily procure    the stage horses you desire—when furnished with money for that purpose as jno berry was made a soldier how legally the court of officers c that sent him can better declare i must think it not only repugnant to law but to the articles of war and the customs of the army to allow him to enlist in any other corps for by this means if there were no other bad consequences attending it he defrauds the country of doublebountymoney i shall make a prudent use of the power you have been pleased to give me respecting the issuing orders to the parties of militia your favor of the  d by mr french mason i have just been presented with and would gladly have appointed him ensign in the regiment had not the vacancies been disposed of in the following manner before it came to hand vizt capt lt bullet to joshua lewiss company—mr duncanson oldest ensign to the lieutenancy occasioned by this removal and mr thomas gist and mr allen volunteers and john mccully  john sallard worthy sergeants all of whom had served a considerable time with credit and reputation to be ensigns—i had likewise before the receipt of yours promised major hite of this county a gentleman of good character the colors that would become vacant upon the event of colo mercers company being filled up as he in consideration had engaged to recruit  0 men for the service—which i then thought would be a vast advantage i am c    george washington    may      fort loudoun francis halket to major francis halket fort loudoun    may      dear sir i am this day favored with yours of the  th instant and would have thought myself extremely culpable and deficient in my duty had i delayed one moment in transmitting to the general any intelligence i could procure much less such a material one as that he has had information of i must therefore beg that you will from me assure the general the catawbas have not this year brought in one prisoner or scalp to this place nor indeed to any other that i ever heard of there hath been no prisoner taken by any of our friendly indians this season and no scalps except the two taken near fort duquesne by ucahula of which and all the intelligence of the enemy in that quarter which that young warrior was able to give i by the last post sent to the general a full and circumstantial account nor would i have failed to have kept him duly informed of every interesting occurrence even had it not been recommended to me it gave me no small uneasiness when i was informed of the resolution which some of the cherokees had made of wandering towards the indian settlements in maryland and pennsylvania clearly foreseeing the bad consequences such a peregrination would produce i therefore represented the matter to captain gist in the strongest manner and must do him the justice to say that nothing in his power was left unessayed to prevent it but our efforts proved ineffectual as those two provinces    last year very impolitically i humbly conceive made those indians presents and encouraged their returning thither this spring and such is the nature of indians that nothing will prevent their going where they have any reason to expect presents and their cravings are insatiable when there is any farther prospect of getting a benefit i and my officers constantly have and always will pay the strictest regard to every circumstance that may contribute to put and keep the indians in a good humor but as governor dinwiddie ordered me not to meddle or interfere with indian affairs on any pretence whatever the sole management of them being left to mr atkin and his deputy mr gist and those orders having never been countermanded neither i nor my officers have adventured to do any thing relative to them but in a secondary manner through mr gist the raven warrior was on a scout  in which he was unsuccessful on his return hither he produced two white mens scalps which he brought from his own nation and wanted to pass them for the enemys taken in his unsuccessful scout in this villany he was detected by the other warriors who were highly offended at so base a deceit and threatened to kill him for it a consciousness of his guilt and a dread of being called to a severe account by his own countrymen were the reasons which many of them assigned for his going away in so abrupt but by no means dissatisfactory a manner to the    english  as captain bosomworth was here transacting indian affairs under the immediate orders of the commanderinchief when the raven warrior returned and was detected i only wrote in mine to general forbes superficially on the subject referring to captain bosomworth for particulars imagining it more properly belonged to him to do so it gives me infinite pleasure that the general seems by the great pains he takes to be so well satisfied of the importance their services will be of but cannot help being under some uneasiness that it will be almost impracticable to keep them until they will be wanted they say that they did not leave home with an intention of staying any considerable time that they can see no appearance of our being soon able to take the field that staying any time for our assembling and afterwards for our slow motions would detain them too long from their own nation but that they would go home and be back again by the time they are wanted these and many things to the same purpose are used by most of the parties that come in from war as reasons for going off and altho we have here done every thing in our power to remove these objections and to prevent their going yet a party of    cherokees went off this morning but on receipt of your letter i followed them told them it was from the general and by its assistance at last prevailed on them to return yet i    dread that unless they see the troops assemble soon it will be very difficult if not impossible to retain any number of the cherokees altho nothing in my power will be wanting to prevent their leaving us which might be of the most fatal consequences to this part of the continent enclosed is my return for april but you will please to observe that captn woodwards is made out from his last as his great distance from hence puts it out of his power to send it in due time i beg you will inform the general that i shall with great alacrity obey all the orders with which he may honor me in the mean time i am with unfeigned regard dear halket yours c george washington    may      williamsburg to the president of the council williamsburg    may      honble sir i came here at this critical juncture by the express order of sir john st clair to represent in the fullest manner the posture of our affairs at winchester and to obviate any doubts that might arise from the best written narrative i shall make use of the following method as the most effectual i can at present suggest to lay sundry matters before you for your information approbation and direction and i hope when your honor considers how we are circumstanced and how absolutely necessary is despatch that you will please to give me explicit and speedy answers on the several points which are submitted for without the latter the service will be greatly impeded    and wanting the former my conduct may be liable to error and to censure to begin  st sir john st clairs letter will i apprehend inform your honor of our principal wants namely arms tents and other sorts of fieldequipage—articles so absolutely and obviously necessary as to need no argument to prove that the men will be useless without them and that the vast sums of money which have been expended in levying and marching them to the place of rendezvous will be entirely lost besides impeding if not defeating the expedition and losing every indian now on our frontiers by delay   the officers will be entirely unprovided with the means of taking the field till they have an allowance made to them of baggage forage and batmoney governor dinwiddie from what cause i could never yet learn thought proper to discontinue this allowance to the companies that remained in virginia at the same time that he allowed it to those who went to carolina although i produced evidence under general stanwixs hand the then commanding officer on this quarter that all officers were entitled to it and that it was indispensably necessary to equip them for and enable them to take the field general forbes has obtained this allowance for the pennsylvania troops and desired sir john st clair who has given me a copy of it signed to urge it strongly on this government also see the copy   the different pay of the two virginia regiments will i conceive if a stop is not put to it be productive of great discontent and many evils for the    soldiers of the first regiment think their claim upon the country equally good if not better than that of the second because their services are not limited  they have lacked the great bounty which the others have received and have had no clothes for near two years when in strictness they have an annual call for and an equal right to expect them   as our regimental clothing cannot possibly last the campaign will it not be advisable to send for a supply against next winter i have sent to philadelphia for one thousand pair of indian stockings leggings the better to equip my men for the woods and should be glad to know whether i am to pay for them in behalf of the country or deduct the cost out of their pay as they have not received the clothing they are entitled to they may think this latter rather hard   should not the pay of the surgeons mates in the first regiment be equal to that of those in the second the latter have four and the former only three shillings per day and should there not be the same number of surgeons mates allowed to the old as are to the new regiment   it will cause great dissatisfaction in the regiment if lieutenant baker is put over the heads of older officers it is granted that mr baker is a very deserving officer but there are others equally deserving and have adventured equally to seek glory    and to merit applause ensign chew for instance was with him when the scalps were taken capt mckenzie lt gist mr woodward and many others have adventured as far into the enemys country tho with less success i therefore hope to prevent the disorders consequent upon his advancement that your honor will suffer colo mercers company to be given to mr stewart the oldest lieutenant as captn lewis in the like case was to mr bullet   sir john st clair directs in consequence of orders from the general that the first virginia regiment shall immediately be completed and leaves the mode of doing it to your honor i should be glad of direction in this affair the season i fear is too far advanced to attempt it now by recruiting   lt steenbugen having been guilty of several irregular and ungentlemanly practices and finding his conduct was about to be inquired into begged leave to resign which i granted so far as depended upon me because the crimes he was then accused of were not sufficient to break him altho quite sufficient to give the whole corps the most indifferent opinion of his morals this resignation and captn lt stewarts promotion will cause two vacancies in the regiment to fill up which and to make the several promotions hereby occasioned will require five blank commissions   i should be glad to know if the works at fort loudoun are still to go on in what manner to be forwarded and under whose direction nothing surely will contribute more to the public weal than  0 his fort when completed because it will be a valuable repository for our stores if the event of our enterprise prove successful and an asylum for the inhabitants and place of retreat for our troops in case of a defeat  0 great advantages must consequently arise by appointing lieutenant smith to that direction and to the command of fort loudoun first because he has had the overlooking of the works for nearly two years is by that means become perfectly well acquainted with every thing intended to be done and is exceedingly industrious secondly because there must necessarily be many sick and lame soldiers left at that garrison who may require the eye of a diligent officer to keep them together thirdly because all the regimental stores and baggage must be left at that place and ought to be under the care of an officer who can be made accountable for his conduct and not left to the mercy of an ungovernable and refractory militia and fourthly it is necessary if for no other reason than to preserve the materials for finishing the works that are now lying there    i conceive we shall be ordered to take with us the greatest part of the ammunition now at fort loudoun it will be necessary therefore to have a supply laid in at that place for the use of the frontier garrisons    i did in a late letter endeavor to point out in what manner the service would be benefited by continuing rutherfords rangers in the parts they now are and sending the militia of prince william to the branch in their stead and i again recommend it for    the reasons then given and for many others which might be given i must now conclude with once more begging that your honor will come to some speedy determination on these several matters from what sir john st clair has wrote from my orders and from what i have here set forth i conceive it must sufficiently appear that the greatest dispatch is absolutely necessary—the success of our expedition in a manner depending upon the early commencement of it every delay therefore may be attended with pernicious consequences the indians glad of any pretence for returning home will make use of delays for a handle and a spirit of discontent and desertion may spring up among the new levies for want of employment these are matters obvious to me and my duty requires that i represent them in this free and candid manner     george washington    june      fort loudoun john forbes to general forbes fort loudoun    june      sir pardon the liberty i am going to use—a liberty that nothing but the most disinterested regard for the safety and welfare of these colonies would induce me to take how far my ideas on what i am about to observe are compatible with reason and may correspond with your sentiments on the matter i candidly submit to your excellencys determination the unfortunate arrival of the cherokees into these governments so early in the spring and the unavoidable accidents that have hitherto prevented a    junction of the troops intended for the western expedition have caused them as they are naturally of a discontented temper to be tired of waiting and all except those who came last with colo byrd and a few others that have joined since to return home how long these can be prevailed upon to remain with us i will not take upon me to affirm but i can venture to say it will not be   weeks if it requires that time to form our magazines and prepare for our march—as colo bouquet seemed to think it would now in this event we shall be left to perform without them a march of more than  00 miles from our advanced post before we shall arrive at fort du quesne a great part of which will be over mountains and rocks and thro such defiles as will enable the enemy with the assistance of their indians and irregulars and their superior knowledge of the country to render extremely arduous unsafe and at best tedious our intended expedition unless we also can be assisted by a body of indians who i conceive to be the best if not the only troops fit to cope with indians in such grounds for i beg leave further to add that i do not suppose success in such a country as i have described is to be the consequence of numbers on the contrary i conceive the march of an unwieldy body of troops covering their convoys may be penetrated by a few who are light and unencumbered—of this however i am certain they may be greatly harrassed and their march much incommoded by the skulking enemy we have to deal with    from what has and might be said on this occasion it should appear that indians to us are of the utmost importance and as i understand your excellency proposes to keep open the communication with the inhabitants and to secure a retreat if it should be our misfortune by the establishment of posts at advantageous situations and at proper distances as the army advances a work truly of the greatest importance especially as we shall but too probably begin our march with a handfull of indians i think it would be practicable during the prosecution of this plan to get a number of the indians to our assistance by sending a person of abilities and address immediately for them before we could approach fort du quesne and i think it is not likely we shall meet with any formidable opposition till we get pretty near that place another great advantage that might be derived from sending a person to the cherokee nation would be to reconcile tis to be hopd those differences that have lately happened between them and some of the frontier inhabitants of this colony which if not properly and timously attended to may be productive of the most serious consequences to the british interest in america and terminate in the ruin of our southern settlements the southern indians of late seem to be wavering and have on several occasions discovered an inclination to break with us i think it will admit of no doubt that if we should be unsuccessful in this quarter which heaven avert the united force of several powerful nations of them might    be employed against us and that such an acquisition to the enemy would enable them to desolate our southern colonies and make themselves masters of that part of the continent is not to be questioned wherefore that nothing should be omitted that might contribute to prevent so dreadful a calamity i suggest the idea of sending a proper person immediately to the cherokee nation who may not only heal the differences which now subsist but get a body of them to join the army on their march and no person surely who has the interest of our important cause at heart woud hesitate a moment to engage in such a service on the event of which our all in a manner depends there is now a large cargoe of proper goods for trading with them just arrived from england in this colony necessary supplies might be drawn from thence and laid in at proper places for them which would prevent those delays and disappointments which they have had too much cause to complain of it would i confess require much time before indians who are now to be sent for could join us but as the delays are to be expected in forming our magazines establishing our posts and marching thro such an extent will also require time it may i think be effected and the farther the summer is advanced the more will our want of indians and our march be facilitated and secured by means of them for if a decisive action should happen to the northward and the enemy prove victorious they would in that case add strength to their garrisons on the    ohio—by indians at least who would easily be induced by the prospect of plunder to come to their aid—but no delay in expectation of indians or on any other account ought to be admitted because among other evils resulting from it would be the expiration of the term of service of the second virginia regiment who stand engaged to the  st of december only  what time the french may require to assemble a formidable body of indians at fort du quesne—how they are provided for victualling such a body there and how far they may be able to prevail upon them to wait the uncertain march of our army when they have assembled them—are matters i profess myself to be ignorant of—but if we are allowed to draw inferences from our own difficulties in these cases we may in the first place conclude i think that our preparations c have sufficiently alarmed them—and that they have got together what indians they can—next—that those indians will require the same provisions and perhaps the same humoring that    ours do and lastly that they may also get dissatisfied at waiting and return home like ours have done thinking our preparations a feint only to draw off their attention from the northward my solicitude on account of indians sufficiently appears throughout all i have said—your excellency is the best judge of the plan you have to execute and the time it will require to bring your operations to bear you are also a proper judge of the time it will take to accomplish the scheme i have proposed of getting indians to our assistance and how far it may correspond in point of time with other measures and therefore it woud be presuming too much after i have endeavored tho a little indigestedly to shew the necessity of indians and the advantages and disadvantages of a late campaign to say any thing further unless it be to apologize once more for the freedom i have taken of mentioning matters which i suppose you are equally if not better acquainted with than i am and to assure your excellency that i am c george washington   th june      fort loudoun governor fauquier to governor fauquier fort loudoun   th june      honble sir the letter herewith enclosed woud have been sent according to the date but i have been waiting till now for capt rutherfords payroll his company being much dispersed in the ranging service this day the prince william militia are to march for the southbranch to relieve two companies of my    regiment agreeably to orders—enclosed is a return of their present strength i should think myself deficient in duty were i to pass over in silence the conduct and state of this company from their first coming out—about the  0th ultimo—until the present moment one hundred militia were ordered from prince william county but at what time i can not exactly say by mr president blair instead of that number    only came and every one of them unprovided with arms and ammunition as the law directs by which means they were not only useless but really burthensome to the country as they were eating its provisions and had their pay running on this matter was represented to colo henry lee lieutenant of that county by sir john st clair then commanding officer here the consequence of this representation was that about the  st of this instant near  00 arms were sent up by his order out of which number scarce five were serviceable and not more than  0 coud be made to fire this was also represented to colo lee who after expressing his concern for it said the county expected arms from england every day and has taken no farther notice of the matter since that i have yet heard i immediately set smiths to repairing their arms and have with the assistance of    old muskets which i caused to be delivered out of the store here got this company which ought to have consisted of  00 men tho there are but    at last completed till this time they have been a dead expence to the public and of no service to the inhabitants this    sir is a true statement of facts and really merits reprehension for if such behavior is suffered to escape unnoticed the most destructive consequences may accrue in the present case if the troops had marched agreeable to the orders i at first received the companies on the southbranch would have been drawn off and the inhabitants thereby left destitute of support or must have come off with them which it seems they were determined to do this i understand actually did happen in augusta county when major lewis came from thence by the negligence i suppose of the countylieutenants i am c  george washington   july      fort cumberland henry bouquet to colonel henry bouquet commanding at raystown camp near fort cumberland   july      sir your favors of the   th ulto and first inst i have had the honour to receive according to order i marchd from winchester the   th and arrivd at this place yesterday in the afternoon with five companies of the first virginia regiment and a company of artificers of the second as you may observe by the enclosed returns my march by bad teams and bad roads notwithstanding i had sent the artificers and a covering party on three days before was much delayed  0 i herewith send a return of the provisions and forage that came up under my escort we lost three bullocks and that in driving i cant absolutely say for what purpose the forage is intended or where to be lodged it was engaged by mr walker at sir jno st clairs request and i believe for the light horse the principal part of it met us at pearsalls on the south branch and neither myself nor any person else was empowered or even desird to receive and pay for it i was at a loss how to act but thought it most advisable to bring it on if it is not intended for the light horse as i apprehend i shoud be glad of your directions concerning it for captn stewart who possibly may be instructed for this purpose i left equipping his troop at winchester and is not yet joind me as i cant suppose you intended to order any part of my men upon the roads till joind at this place by colonel byrd i shall decline sending any upon that service till his arrival which i suppose may be tomorrow as he was preparing to march the   th after me i enclose you an exact return of the maryland troops in garrison at this place also of their provisions and of the kings stores and shoud be glad to know what strength you woud have this garrison consist of how many days provisions left for them and what quantity of ammunition i brought one half of all that was orderd from winchester by sir jno st clair and left the other half to follow with colo byrd—powder excepted and of that article there was only    barrels in the store there besides      others that were made up into cartridges—which are also brought up between us mr walker in consequence of instructions from mr hoops who i believe purposd to supply us from rays town put a stop to a further purchase of provisions you will see by the returns for what number of days i am supplied and i desird colo byrd to bring as much to this place as would serve his men a fortnight at least i am at a loss to know whether officers servants that are not soldiers are allowd to draw provisions and shoud be thankfull for your directions as i have had many applications on that head there are few tools  for the services requird but before a supply coud be got to this place from sir jno st clair or governor sharpe the work with what few we have i hope may be near finishd rum too i fear will be a scarce article with us pray what will be done with the company of byrds regiment ordered to take post at edwardss and pearsalls shall they continue there or join their regiment i left in consequence of your orders an officer and thirty men invalids at fort loudoun    for safety of the stores c lodgd there and also a sergeant and    at pearsalls to secure that post and keep open the road for expresses for no more can be expected from so small a command byrd i hope will leave   or   of his invalids or bad men at edwardss for the same purpose there came    wagons to this place with me and i believe if they were wanted  0 more might be had upon the south branch strong and good but carryinghorses are certainly more eligible for the service we are destind i have used my best endeavors to get my men equipd with powder horns and shott pouches and have procured   0 of the former and     of the latter besides the linnen ones with which we are compleated i have received a very scanty allowance of tents for the   companies with me vizt sixtynine only out of these most of the officers must be supplied or lye uncoverd they will readily pay for what they receive if requird no bell tents were sent to us my men are very bare of cloaths regimentals i mean and i have no prospect of a supply this want so far from my regretting during this campaign that were i left to pursue my own inclinations i woud not only order the men to adopt the indian dress but cause the officers to do it also and be the first to set the example myself nothing but the uncertainty of its taking with the general  causes me to hesitate a moment at leaving my regimentals at this    place and proceeding as light as any indian in the woods t is an unbecoming dress i confess for an officer but convenience rather than shew i think shoud be consulted the reduction of bat horses alone is sufficient to recommend it for nothing is more certain than that less baggage will be requird and that the publick will be benefited in proportion i was desirous of being thus full in my letter to you how far it may be consistent with good policy as there is at least a possibility of its falling into the enemys hands i know not but i shall be directed in these affairs by you  george washington   july      fort cumberland henry bouquet to colonel bouquet camp near fort cumberland   july      sir colo byrd with eight companies of his regt arrivd here yesterday he left many sick men behind him as may be seen by the enclosed report which with the company he posted at edwards and pearsalls reduces our strength considerably i am a good deal at a loss therefore to know how to act for the best as your last orders for joining you at rays town were not positive and seemed to be given on a supposition that mr walker either coud not or was not to supply us with provisions here your doubts will in some measure be obviated when you see mr walkers letter to me on this head and the returns of our provisions which i now    send if this therefore was your motive for desiring a garrison to be left at this place and for me to march on to rays town with the remainder of the virginia troops you will i presume countermand our march to that place for the following reasons first because  00 men may i think open the communication to rays town with safety and with much greater ease and convenience than if our whole body marches on incumbered with a number of wagons secondly it will if the army is obliged to take this route  as i am told from all hands it certainly must prevent the fatigues  of a countermarch to men and horses just going upon service thirdly it will afford us an opportunity of lodging our provisions and stores here while the wagons may return for another convoy and save by that means the great expense of transporting them to there and back again if we should not be able to proceed from thence  and fourthly colo byrd assures me that the indians with him absolutely refuse to march any other road than this they know  i was advised to hint these matters  to you and wait  the result of your answer before i put the whole  in motion whatever you direct  under these circumstances i shall  execute with the greatest punctuality and expedition in my power i enclose return of the no of waggons now at this place that you may be judge 0 of the expense    captn dagworthy telling me that governor sharpe is to open the road to the town creek which is within    miles of this place and as maryland has near  00 men here fit for duty i hope you will be of opinion that they are sufficiently strong to proceed on the fort frederick road without needing a reinforcement from us especially if you will please to consider at the same time that they are in a manner coverd by the troops at this place and those which may be employd on the road to rays town on which i shall send a detachment to work tomorrow  i had wrote thus far when your letter of yesterday came to hand as we lye so contiguous and can hear in so short a time from you i shall only be preparing to obey your orders but shall not actually march till i hear from you again  a pretty good stock of liquor came up with the last convoy we have no hay at this place twas corn i calld forage we shall have tools sufficient for opening the road to rays town among the artificers of colo byrds regiment and i enclose a list of what is here belonging to maryland that you may be able to judge of their wants    i am sorry to hear that the cattawbas have so egregiously misbehaved when i write to govr fauquier which i expect may be in a few days i shall touch on this subject  george washington july   th      fort cumberland henry bouquet to colonel bouquet camp at fort cumbd abt    thursday night july   th      sir abt   oclock this afternoon—after i had closed my letter to you—i received information  that two men were killed and a third taken prisoner on the road about a mile from this place i got the indians to go  and sent a command of  0 men immediately to the spot where they took the track of six indians and followed them till near dark when the indians returned as did our party also they discovered that one of the men  killed was a soldr of the second regiment and that the other two were herds  going to our  grass guards in the most careless  straggling manner contrary to repeated and positive orders given to prevent small parties  stragling from camp 0    the mischief was done abt   this morning—our discovery of it  too late to give us a chance to overtake  the enemy—i thought it advisable nevertheless to give you intelligence  that the enemy are about and that i expect we shall be pesterd with their parties  all this morn  haunting our camps and watching our motions i have apprizd colo mercer captn dagworthy and all our out parties of this murder that they may be strictly  upon their guard marching—and vigilant in their camps the inclosd i this instant received from captn dagworthy—if it is not in your power to afford him assistance —tis entirely out of mine to do it p s captn bosomworth c are safely arrivd here he and colo byrd join me in their compliments  george washington   th july      fort cumberland henry bouquet to colonel bouquet camp at fort cumberland   th july      sir your favor of the   th by doctr johnston i had the pleasure to receive the same day—nothing extraordinary since my last has occurrd by a party from colo mercer to this place for provisions i find they have opend the road only   miles and that they proceed much slower in this service than i expected this possibly may arise from the pains they take to make the road  good and from the    width of it  0 feet which i directed that two waggons might conveniently go a brest—if you dont open on your side in this manner i shoud be obligd to you to direct  colo  mercer otherwise —as it will be useless to have one part wide and the other narrow  it gave  me great pleasure to find you approvd  of the dress i have put my men into i have really done it from a good intention  caprice and whim had no share in causing of it—on the contrary  t is evident i think that soldiers in such a dress  are better able to carry their provisions are fitter for the active service we are engaged 0 in and less liable to sink under the fatigues of a long   march besides the advantages of contracting by this means our line of march which must extend always in proportion as we are incumberd with carriages or horses   i have heard nothing from captn dagworthy since he marched but expect the waggons are at winchester by this time that i dispatched the same day  —i beg pardon for the liberty i have taken in recommending a letter for majr halket to your care    george washington    july      fort cumberland henry bouquet to colonel bouquet camp at fort cumberland    july      sir i was favored with yours of the   th instant at eleven oclock last night the express who brought it informs me that he was fired at twice by six indians and obliged to abandon his horse there have three parties gone from hence towards the enemys country within these few days the largest of them consisting of an officer and eighteen cherokees marched three days ago i always send out some white people  with the indians and will today or tomorrow send an officer and some alert  white men with another party of cherokees as you desire it tho i must confess that i think these scalping parties of indians we send out will more effectually harass the enemy by keeping them under continual alarms than any parties of white people can do as small parties of ours  are not equal to the undertaking not being so dexterous at skulking as indians and large ones will be discovered by their scalping parties  early enough to give the enemy time to repel them by  a superior force and at all events a  great probability of losing many of our best men and fatiguing many more  before the most essential services are  entered on and am afraid not answer the proposed end   0 you are pleased to desire my opinion with regard to  making an irruption into the enemys country with a strong party as such an enterprise at this juncture when we may suppose the enemy have  or are collecting their principal  force in that vicinity  would require a formidable party the supplying of which with provisions etc immediately might be difficult and the march of such a body so considerable a distance must be discovered as they have parties continually watching our motions which would too probably terminate in the miscarriage of the enterprise and perhaps the destruction of our party i should think it more eligible to defer it till the army reaches pretty near that country i shall direct the officer that marches towards the enemy to be at particular pains in reconnoitring general braddocks road tho i have had repeated accounts of it wanting such small repairs as can with ease be done as fast as the army can march it is impossible for me to send out any men to repair it as colo mercer and captn dagworthy got every tool for that purpose i had if we had tools to go upon the roads the second company of artificers would no doubt be wanted here but as it is i imagine they will be better employed with you the malbehaviour of the indians gives me great concern  if they were hearty in our interest their    services would be infinitely valuable as i cannot conceive the best white men to be equal to them in the woods but i fear they are too sensible of their high importance to us to render us any very acceptable service as the par of exchange between virginia and pennsylvania is by the laws of the two provinces settled at twentyfive per cent in favor of the former i apprehend we can have no right to settle on any other footing especially as any material deviation therefrom might be productive of very bad consequences since writing the above the warriors of the party of cherokees insisted on marching instantly and that but one white man should go they are gone and i have given the white man the necessary orders relative to the roads c inclosed is a return of our provisions since which was made out the marylanders drew for  00 men for ten days i am c george washington    july      fort cumberland henry bouquet to colonel bouquet camp near fort cumberland    july      sir your obliging favor of this date i just now had the pleasure of receiving you make me quite happy by your coinciding with me relative to the proposed expedition captain dagworthys party returned hither yesterday in consequence of orders from sir john st clair    forwarded by the commanding officer at fort frederick i have directed him to finish a bridge at this place which i imagine he will effect by tomorrow night with his tools i will next day send out a party on general braddocks road which i shall be able to reinforce when colonel mercer returns  i am excessively obliged by the very handsome and polite manner by which you are pleased to give me leave to attend the election at winchester tho my being there on that occasion would at any other time be very agreeable to me yet at this juncture i can hardly persuade myself to think of being absent from my more immediate duty even for a few days however i will not come to any absolute determination in this matter till i receive answers to some letters on that subject which i expect this night or tomorrow  i am c    george washington july  0      martha custis to mrs martha custis july  0      we have begun our march for the ohio a courier is starting for williamsburg and i embrace the opportunity to send a few words to one whose life is now inseparable from mine since that happy hour when we made our pledges to each other my thoughts have been continually going to you as another self that an allpowerful providence may keep us both in safety is the prayer of your ever faithful and affectionate friend     george washington    july      fort cumberland henry bouquet to colonel bouquet camp near fort cumberland    july      sir before colonel stephen came to this place last night i had abandoned all thoughts of attending personally at the election in winchester determining rather to leave the management of that matter to my friends than be absent from my regiment when there is a probability of its being called upon i am now much pleased that i did do so colonel byrd has given me your letter of yesterday in consequence i send you a return of the forage and he writes to mr gist concerning vermilion for the indians we participate in the joy felt for the success of his majestys arms at louisburg c but sincerely lament the loss of that brave and active nobleman lord howe we have got the bridge finished at this place and tomorrow major peachy with three hundred men proceed to open general braddocks road i shall direct their going to georges creek ten miles advanced by that time i may possibly hear from you if they go farther it may be requisite to reinforce the party but this matter i suppose will be ordered according to the route determined on by the general for it will be needless to open a road that no use is made of     colonel stephen gives me some room to apprehend that a body of light troops may soon move on i pray your interest most heartily with the general to get my regiment and myself included in the number if there needs any argument to obtain this favor i hope without vanity i may be allowed to say that from long intimacy and scouting in these woods my men are as well acquainted with all the passes and difficulties as any troops that will be employed and therefore may answer any purpose intended by them as well as any other body the general directs that the troops be provided with covers to their locks where to get these i know not there is but one possible way of succeeding and that is by taking the neat hides and these will fall short the commissaries ask eighteen shillings apiece for them i should be glad of your advice in this case as also what will be done with the wagons expected up in our next convoy i cannot say exactly what number there may be of them but suppose the provisions forage and stores cannot employ less than fifty please to offer my compliments to mr glen  forward a letter herewith sent to majr halket george washington    july      fort cumberland henry bouquet to colonel bouquet camp at fort cumberland    july      dear sir i wrote to you by colonel stephen since which i have been favored with your kind and obliging letter of yesterday    we have received advice that our second convoy of seventyodd waggons an account of the contents of which i enclosed you yesterday will be at the south branch today where i expect they will be joined by some waggons with forage the number i can not ascertain and will all proceed to this place immediately on friday i shall look for them i shall most chearfully work on any road pursue any route or enter upon any service that the general or yourself may think me usefully employed in or qualified for and shall never have a will of my own when a duty is required of me but since you desire me to speak my sentiments freely permit me to observe that after having conversed with all the guides and having been informed by others who have knowledge of the country that a road to be compared with genl braddocks or indeed that will be fit for transportation even by pack horses cannot be made i own i have no predilection for the route which you have in contemplation for me not because difficulties appear therein but because i doubt the giving satisfaction in the execution of the plan i know not what reports you may have received from your reconnoitring parties but i have been uniformly told that if you expect a tolerable road by rays town you will be disappointed for no movement can be made that way without destroying our horses i should be extremely glad of one hours conference with you when the general arrives i would then explain myself more fully and i think i could    demonstrate the advantages of pushing out a body of light troops on this quarter i would make a trip to rays town with great pleasure if my absence here could be dispensed for a day or two of which you can best judge we shall want no provisions from you the second convoy added to what we have will furnish us with a tolerably good stock if major livingston or any other officer at this place draws more than one ration it is contrary to orders and without my knowledge and must be attributed to the commissary whose fault alone it must be in delivering it we have been obliged for the sake of our cattle to move the grass guard to cresaps    miles hence there the provision is slaughtered and served to the guard and to the troops of lighthorse also at that place it is therefore necessary that mr dow or an attendant of the commissary should be present and see to the issuing of it there were two commissaries at this place beside a numberless train of butchers herdsmen c so immensely lazy that i was under the necessity of ordering some of them to attend the guard for the commissaries looking upon cattle to be at the kings risque were quite indifferent what became of them and of course gave themselves no trouble about them i send you a return of colonel byrds regiment and of the maryland troops at this place i should have done the same with respect to the first regiment had not the adjutant accompanied colo    stephen to rays town and locked it up i can only send one for the companies here present and this is forwarded to him that it may be completed there for your use kelly  stalnaker two of our guides are on the road with major peachy the rest at this place i have directed to attend you it would be extremely inconvenient for me at this time to garrison the blockhouse on the rays town road having such large detachments already out and the campduty very hard upon us i am c  george washington   th july      fort cumberland gabriel jones to gabriel jones camp at fort cumberland   th july      dear sir permit me to return you my sincerest thanks for your great assistance at the late election and to assure you that i shall ever return a lively sense of the favor i am extreme sorry that you neglected your own election in augusta by this means but i hope you are secure in hampshire our expedition seems overcast with too many ills to give you any satisfaction in a transient relation of them god knows whats intended for nothing seems ripe for execution backwardness and i would if i dare say more appears in all things    tomorrow i am summond to a conference with colonel bouquet on the rays town road when i shall warmly urge the advanced season and every other argument that the important matter requires to hurry things forward and shall endeavor to obtain leave if possible to advance on with the virginians to the crossing at least opening the road  constructing posts as we go i am c george washington july      james wood to colonel james wood july      my dear colonel if thanks flowing from a heart replete with joy and gratitude can in any measure compensate for the fatigue anxiety and pain you had at my election be assured you have them tis a poor but i am convinced welcome tribute to a generous mind such i believe yours to be how i shall thank mrs wood for her favorable wishes and how acknowledge my sense of obligations to the people in general for their choice of me i am at a loss to resolve on but why can i do it more effectually than by making their interest as it really is my own and doing everything that lyes in my little power for the honor and welfare of the country i think not and my best endeavors they may always command i promise this now when promises may be regarded before they might pass as words of course i am extreme thankful to you and my other friends for entertaining the freeholders in my name i hope  0 no exception was taken to any that voted against me but that all were alike treated and all had enough it is what i much desired my only fear is that you spent with too sparing a hand i dont like to touch upon our public affairs the prospect is overspread by too many ills to give a favourable account i will therefore say little but yet say this that backwardness appears in all things but the approach of winter—that joggs on apace  george washington henry bouquet to colonel bouquet  monday   oclock pm dear sir you will be surprisd till i give you a reason for it at receiving a letter from a person in the same camp with you and who has free access at all times to your tent—but when i tell you that we were interrupted while conversing on a very important matter and that i did not certainly know whether i might have another opportunity of renewing the conversation till you had some how or other settled the point with the general i flatter myself you will excuse the freedom i now beg leave to use with you i dont doubt sir but you have thoroughly considered the practicability of the scheme you this night mentioned to me and the good or evil consequences to be derived there from according to its success—it    might therefore seem unreasonable to offer the following crude thoughts did i not believe you are desirous of hearing opinions at least on this occasion how far then do you believe our stock of provisions—to say nothing of other matters—will allow you to execute this plan will it last till we could reduce fort duquesne and march back to the inhabitants—or receive a supply elsewhere—if it would do this the measure may be right but if it will not what is the consequence is it not neglecting the strengthening of this place consuming the provisions that should support a garrison here and abandoning our artillery either to the enemy or a general destruction it appears to me in that light now suppose the enemy gives us a meeting in the field and we put them to the route what do we gain by it perhaps triple their loss of men in the first place tho our numbers may be greatly superior and if i may be allowed to judge from what i have seen of late we should not highten much that good opinion they seem to have of our skill in wood fighting therefore to risk an engagement when so much depends upon it without having the accomplishment of the main point in view appears in my eye to be a little imprudent—could we suppose the enemy would immediately evacuate their fort in case of a defeat in the wood—or as i before observd could we be certain of provisions in the other event i think not a moments time is left for hesitation but one or tother of these we ought to be assurd of you i am sensible stand very little in need of any of these    suggestions—which are thrown together in haste as i waited till this moment almost expecting to see you you will at least pardon this liberty and believe me to be c george washington   august      henry bouquet to colonel bouquet camp at fort cumberland   august      sir those matters we talked of relative to the roads has since our parting been the object of my closest attention and so far am i from altering my opinion that the more time and attention i give thereto the more i am confirmed in it the validity of the reasons for taking the old road appear in a stronger point of view to enumerate the whole of these reasons would be tedious—and to you who are become so much master of that subject unnecessary therefore i will only briefly mention a few which i conceive so obvious in themselves as must to any unbiassed mind effectually remove what is objected to general braddocks road and urged in favor of a road to be opened from rays town— several years ago the virginians and pennsylvanians commenced a trade with the indians settled on the ohio and to remove the many inconveniences a bad road subjected them to they after reiterated efforts to discover where a good one might be made were found ineffectual employed several of the most intelligent indians who in the course of many years hunting acquired a perfect knowledge of    these mountains to attempt it but these indians after having taken the greatest pains to gain the rewards then offered for this discovery declared the track leading from willscreek was infinitely preferable to any that could be made at any other place time and experience so clearly demonstrated this truth that the pennsylvania traders commonly carried their goods thither by wills creek therefore the ohio company in      at a considerable expense opened a road thither in      the troops i then had the honor to command greatly repaired it as far as gists plantation and in      it was widened and completed by general braddock within   miles of fort duquesne consequently a road that has been so long opened so well repaired—and so often must be much firmer and better than a new one allowing the ground to be originally equally as good but supposing it was practicable to make a road from rays town quite as good as general braddocks i ask if we have time to do it—certainly not surmounting the vast difficulties to be encountered in making it over such monstrous mountains covered with woods and rocks would require so much time as to blast our otherwise well grounded hopes of striking the long wished for and important stroke this season and deferring it to another year would i am morally certain be productive of the most destructive consequences to the southern and middle colonies for they have to make a noble push towards ending those calamities under which they so long have groaned granted supplies beyond their abilities—these    funds will in a few months be exhausted the troops of course disbanded—their inability and discouragement from so great a disappointment will prevent their attempting a similar effort against another season and experience evinces that expence and numbers must be encreased in proportion to our delays the southern indians have from our bad success and inactivity long looked upon us in a despicable light have already committed hostilities on our frontiers and only wait the result of this campaign to unmask themselves which would be such an acquisition to the enemy as might terminate in our destruction the favorable accounts some give of the forage on the rays town road being so much better than the other are certainly exaggerated greatly as every unprejudiced person who is acquainted with both agrees that the only difference between the mountains here and there is that those are more inaccessible and it is well known that in both the rich valleys between the mountains abound with good food and those that are stony and brushy are destitute col byrd and the engineer who accompanied him confirm this truth and surely the meadows on this road would greatly overbalance the advantage of having grass to the foot of the ridge on this side the mountain on the rays town road and all agree that a more barren road is no where to be found than rays town to the inhabitants which is likewise to be considered with the badness of the road    and the principal objection made to general braddocks road is that of the waters to pass but these very rarely swell so much as to obstruct the passage the yaughyaughgane which is the most rapid and soonest filled i with a body of troops have crossed after  0 odd days almost constant rain in fine any difficulties that may arise therefrom are so trivial that they are really not worth mentioning the monongahela the largest of all these rivers may if necessary be easily avoided as mr frazer the principal guide informed me by passing a defile which i cannot conceive to be so bad as commonly represented but even that he tells me may be shunned it is said again that there are many defiles on this road—i grant there are some but know of none that cannot be traversed if found necessary and i should be glad to know if a road can be had over these mountains not subject to this inconvenience—unless they kept the heights always—and that is impracticable the shortness of the road from rays town to fort duquesne by loyal hanny  is used as an argument in disfavor of this road and bears some thing in it unaccountable to me for i must beg leave to ask here if it requires more time or is it more difficult and expensive to go     miles in a good road already made to our hands or to cut a road  00 miles in length great part of which over almost inaccessible mountains—and—to say or think we can do nothing    more this fall than to fortify some post on the other side of the mountains and prepare against another campaign—i must pray heaven most fervently to avert till we find it impracticable at least to prosecute with prudence the enterprise in hand we have yet time enough to transport provisions to last the siege and to support the troops that may winter there as i shall endeavor hereafter to shew—at any rate it never can be an argument for opening the other road at this time because supposing we are not able to do more than construct a post on tother side the mountains—that post undoubtedly should be on a road that has the easiest and nearest communication with the settlements where supplies are to be drawn from for to say nothing of the great advantage of water carriage this way which certainly is immense as you will find by doctr rosss estimation that you shewed me or of the infinite odds in the goodness of the roads which is very evident to all who have travelled both—either from the inhabitants to the advanced posts or from the advanced posts to fort duquesne—i say to put these reasons aside altho they ought to have their due weight yet this way as being so much nearer the settlements has much advantage—that it is nearer winchester in virginia and fort frederick in maryland by many miles are incontestable facts and i here shew the difference of the two roads to carlyle by giving you the distance of the different stages some of which i have from information only but believe them to be just—    from carlyle to fort duquesne by rays town from carlyle to shippensburg    miles from shippensg to fort loudoun    miles from ft loudoun to ft lyttleton  0 miles from ft lyttleton to juneattasing    miles from juneatta to rays town    miles      from rays town to ft duquesne  00        from carlyle to ft duquesne by ft fredk and cumberland from carlyle to shippensg    miles from shippensg to chambers    miles from chambers to paulins    miles from paulins to ft frederick    miles from ft fredk to ft cumberland  0 miles      from ft cumberland to ft duquesne            by this computation there appears to be a difference of    miles only were all the supplies obliged to come from carlyle it is well known that the goodness of this road is a sufficient compensation for the shortness of the other as the wrecked and broken waggons there clearly demonstrate i shall next give you my reasons against dividing the army in the manner you propose and after that endeavor to shew how the grass on the other road can be made proper use of first then by dividing our army we divide our strength and by pursuing quite distinct routes put it entirely out of the power of each division to succor the other as the proposed new road has no communication with the old    secondly to march in this manner will be attended with many inconveniences as first if we depart from our advanced posts at the same time and make no deposits by the way those troops who go from rays town as they will be light having carrying horses only will arrive at fort duquesne long before the others and must if the enemy are strong there be exposd possibly to many insults in their intrenchments from the cannon of the enemy which they may draw out upon them at their pleasure if they are not strong enough to do this to that division we have but little to apprehend from them go which way or how we will thirdly if that division that escorts the convoy is permitted to march first we risk our all in a manner and are ruined if any accident happened to the artillery to the stores c and lastly if we advance on both roads by deposites we must double our number of troops over the mountains and distress ourselves by victualling of them in these deposites besides losing the proposed advantage that of stealing a march for we cannot suppose the french who have their scouts constantly out can be so difficult in point of intelligence as to be unacquainted with our motions when we are advancing by slow degrees towards them now sir the advantage i would propose to make of the forage along the other path is to support all the carrying horses that can possibly be collected and sent that way after we are fortunate enough to lie before fort duquesne here not only the carrying horses that were to be used out as such but    officers horses and even the waggon horses also may be employed in this service if saddles or packs are provided in the meantime at rays town for them to return with great advantages may be derived from such a measure because as the food of the old road would be entirely eaten up going and the horses get weak it would be impossible that the waggons could return for another convoy tho the horses might nevertheless be in a condition to come down light along a road abounding with food and be able to carry up another convoy giving them two or three days rest at the most convenient feeding places by this means the waggon horses would be eased of the fatigue of bringing down even the empty waggons which is something along a road stripped of the food in the condition the horses by this time may be supposed to be they will i conceive carry near or quite as much weight on their back as they could draw in a waggon from what has been said relative to the two roads it appears i think very clearly that the old one is infinitely better than the other can be made and that there is no room to hesitate a moment which to take when we consider the advanced season and little time left to execute our plan in i shall therefore in the last place offer as desired my sentiments on advancing by deposites the first of which i should have been for getting at the little meadows would time have permitted but as the case now stands i suppose at the great crossing or great  0 meadows our first must be formed the great crossing i esteem the most advantageous post on several accounts especially that of water and security of the passage but then it does not abound in food as the great meadows nor has not so much level land about it fit for culture to this latter place a body of   00 men may march with  00 waggons or carrying horses which would be much better equivalent allowing each waggon to carry  00 lbs of flour and  00 of salt meat you carry  0 days provisions of the former and  0 of the latter for  000 men besides your live cattle any number of which might but ought not to be carried for these two reasons first they would destroy your pasturage—and next your men being employed at work you would have none to attend or guard them your next convoy which i suppose to consist of  00 provision waggons and all the army will at the above rate carry    days provisions of flour and    of salt flesh besides   days which the men may carry on their backs as it is supposed the   00 are to do also so that you have at the meadows according to this calculation     days flour and    salt meat deducting the daily consumption now to accomplish this i allow    days to wit to the great meadows   to unload and return   then i allow the army    days more to prepare and arrive in by which i apprehend our works may be finished and the whole ready to proceed our next deposite probably will be at salt lick about    miles from the meadows to this place i    conceive it necessary to send   00 men to construct some post taking   days provisions only which are sufficient to serve them till the convoy comes up against which time i suppose an intrenched camp or some other kind of defensible work may be effected and from hence i conceive it highly expedient to detach  000 or  000 of the best troops to invest the place and prevent if possible an ingagement in the woods which of all things ought to be avoided the artillery and stores may be up from salt lick in four days and from that time i will allow    days more for the carrying horses to perform a trip to rays town for provisions passing along the old path by loyal hanny in this time they may do it as the horses will go down light but what quantity of provisions they can bring up i cannot say that depending upon the number of horses fitted out with saddles c from this state of the matter which is really a candid one and from my calculations in which large allowances are made for the quantity of provisions as well as for the time of transporting them it appears that from the time the front division begins its march from hence till the whole army gets before fort duquesne is    days at which time there will be    days provisions on hand allowing for the consumption on the march and that    days added to this make    in all which is required for our operations and these ought to be finished if possible by the middle of october i have offered nothing but what to me appears    beyond a probability i have nothing to fear but for the general service and no hopes but the advantages it will derive from the success of our operations therefore cannot be supposed to have any private interest or sinister views by any freedom my regard for the benefit of the service on this occasion has induced me to use i am c george washington   august      fort cumberland francis halket to major francis halket brigade major camp at fort cumberland   august      my dear halket i am just returned from a conference held with colonel bouquet i find him fixed i think i may say unalterably fixed to lead you a new way to the ohio thro a road every inch of which is to be cut at this advanced season when we have scarce time left to tread the beaten track universally confessed to be the best passage through the mountains if colonel bouquet succeeds in this point with the general all is lost—all is lost indeed our enterprise will be ruined and we shall be stopped at the laurel hill this winter but not to gather laurels except of the kind that covers the mountains the southern indians will turn against us and these colonies will be desolated by such an acquisition to the enemys strength these must be the consequences of a miscarriage and a miscarriage the almost necessary consequence of an attempt to march the army by this new route i have given my reasons at large to colonel bouquet he desired that i should    do so that he might forward them to the general should this happen you will be able to judge of their weight i am uninfluenced by prejudice having no hopes or fears but for the general good of this you may be assured and that my sincere sentiments are spoke on this occasion i am dear halket most affectionately yours george washington  th august      fort cumberland governor fauquier to governor fauquier fort cumberland camp the  th august      honble sir your favor of the  0th ultimo i was honored with the day before yesterday i am sorry to find that mr smith has not sent you a return of the arms nor mr ramsay a return of the provisions i will write to both those gentlemen to know the reason enclosed is a return of the first regiment i have delayed till now purposely since my last of the  0th ultimo to give your honor any account of our movements hoping to be furnished with something agreeable being disappointed in this i am sorry to inform you that we are still encamped here and have little prospect of decamping unless a fatal resolution takes place of opening a new road from rays town to fort du quesne in this event i have no doubt that the virginia troops will be honored with a full share of the labor as they have already been in opening a communication from hence to rays town and doing the principal part of the work at that place    i am just returned from a conference held with colo bouquet on this occasion the general lying indisposed at carlyle in this conference i urged in the most forcible terms i was master of the advanced season as an argument against new discoveries i pressed also the difficulties attending the cutting a road over these mountains—known to me from experience the length of time it must require to do it the little time left for that service the moral certainty of its obstructing our march beyond what the advanced season will admit—and the probable miscarriage of the expedition from that cause and lastly i endeavored to represent the distressed condition the colonies would be reduced to consequent thereon in fine i said every thing which the importance of the subject suggested to me to avert a measure that seemed to forebode the manifest ruin of the expedition this is the light in which it presents itself to my mind i pray heaven my fears may not be realized but the thoughts of opening a road  00 miles over mountains almost inaccessible at this advanced season when there is already a good road made—a road universally confessed to be the best that either is or can be found anywhere thro these mountains prognosticates something not quite favorable i have now drawn up a representation of real facts to be presented to the general in which i think the advantages of going the old road and moral certainty of failing in the new are so clearly demonstrated that they must strike every unbiassed mind    the smallpox getting among the troops is another unpromising circumstance an officer and two men of my regiment are now confined with it at rays town from this short narrative of our affairs your honor may draw conclusions you may depend the statement is true free from exaggerations and flowing from a mind deeply affected at the prospect before us i hope as i once before said that i see matters in too strong a point of view and that my apprehensions for the consequences of opening a new road are groundless i am c p s i was this moment presented with a letter from colo bouquet telling me that the general had directed the other road to be opened i expect therefore to be ordered that way immediately orders are not yet arrived george washington  th august      fort cumberland henry bouquet to colonel bouquet camp at fort cumberland  th august      dear sir the generals orders—or the order of any superior officer will when once given be a law to me i shall never hesitate in obeying them but till this order came out i thought it incumbent upon me to say what i could to divert you the commanding officer present from a resolution of opening a new road of which i had the most unfavorable reports and believe from the hight of the hills—the steepness of them the unevenness of the ground in general—and    what above all principally weighed with me the shortness of the season that it was impossible to open a road in time to answer our purpose i am still in this opinion partly from my own observations of the country and partly from the information of as good judges as any that will be employed  my duty therefore to his majesty and the colony whose troops i have the honor to command obliged me to declare my sentiments upon the occasion with that candor and freedom of which you are witness if i am deceived in my opinion i shall acknowledge my error as becomes a gentleman led astray from judgment and not by prejudice in opposing a measure so conducive to the public weal as you seem to have conceived this to be if i unfortunately am right my conduct will acquit me of having discharged my duty on this important occasion on the good success of which our all in a manner depends     i have repaired the road over the mountain at this place as sir jno st clair desired i had also sent the  nd company of artificers to make bridges on the rays town road according to your orders transmitted    by colo stephen to me—twas yesterday before i could get them in and today they march nineteen waggons came here yesterday loaded with ball musket ball from fort frederick    more left their loads at the old town and are gone back—the first    wagons and an escort are gone to bring up their load and will be here today i cant send you a return of the contents having received none the waggoners are constantly applying for grain i should be glad if you would direct how i am to act in this case inclosed is a return of provisions wanting to serve us till our next convoy arrives from winchester we have not above   days flour upon hand i shall therefore send the waggons to rays town tomorrow for this article c after they return from the old town twelve tents was the number i returned for and they are arrived safe if you approve of it i would send  0 men the length of the great ring to way lay the road thereabouts i think it the most eligible method of getting a prisoner for intelligence the enemy are watchful when they are near our garrisons and it is too far and unsafe to bring one from their own     george washington   th augt      fort cumberland henry bouquet to colonel bouquet camp at fort cumberland   th augt      dear sir i am favored with yours of yesterday intimating the probability of my proceeding with a body of troops on general braddocks road and desiring my retaining for that purpose a months provisions at this place a thing which i should be extreme fond of but as i cannot possibly know what quantity of provisions may be necessary for that time without knowing the number of men i may probably march with and when it is likely we may leave this i hope you will be pleased to give me the necessary information on this head as also how this place is to be garrisoned and what provisions and stores should be left i have talked a good deal with kelly upon the nature of the intervening ground from the new road to braddocks and from what he says i apprehend it impracticable to effect a junction with the troops on the new road till we advance near the salt lick which is no great distance from fort duquesne and how far it may be advisable to send a small body of troops so near the enemy at so great a distance from the army without any kind of tools which is certainly our case for repairing the roads or throwing up any kind of defence in case of need i shall not presume to say but i cannot help observing that all the guides and indians are to be drawn  0 from hence and that the greatest part of my regiment is on the other road so that i have but few remaining with me of the first regiment and   companies of the second only whose officers and men can be supposed to know little of the service and less of the country and near or i believe quite a fifth of them sick i thought it incumbent on me to mention these things that you might know our condition at the same time i beg leave to assure you that nothing will give me greater pleasure than to proceed with any number of men that the general or yourself may think proper to order— with regard to keeping out a succession of strong parties on this road from the troops here  i must beg leave to observe that we have not so much as one carrying horse to take provisions out upon being under a necessity tother day of pressing five horses from some countrymen that came to camp on business before i could equip captn mckenzies party for a    days march  that we have not an oz of salt provisions of any kind here and that it is impossible to preserve the fresh especially as we have no    salt neither by any other means than barbacuring it in the indian manner in doing which it loses near a half so that a party who receives  0 days provisions will be obliged to live on little better than   days allowance of meat kind—a thing impracticable a great many of colo byrds men are as i before remarkd very sickly the rest became low spirited and dejected of course the greatest share of that service must fall upon the   companies of the first regiment this sickness and depression of spirits cannot arise i conceive from the situation of our camp which is undoubtedly the most healthy and best aired in this vicinity but is caused i apprehend by the change in their way of living most of them till now having lived in ease and affluence and by the limestone water and air the soldrs of the first would be sickly like those of the  d regiment was it not owing to some such causes as these captn mckenzies party is not yet returned i will advertise you of his discoveries if any are made by him     we have reasons to believe that parties of the enemy are about us likewise yesterday afternoon a waggoner had his horse shot under him about three miles from hence the convoy from winchester has been detained much longer than was expected mr walker desired a party to reinforce the escort at pearsalls  0 miles distant the   th inst which was accordingly sent but i have since been informed that the waggons did not leave winchester till a few days ago we have no indian goods of any kind here it gives me great pleasure to hear that the general is getting better and expected soon at rays town  i am c george washington   st august      fort cumberland henry bouquet to colonel bouquet camp at fort cumberland   st august      dear sir thirty  cuttawbas came here this evening and the convoy may be expected on wednesday as it was at pearsalls last night     governor sharpe i am told will be here in a day or two—i am at a loss to know how he ranks and whether he is entitled to the command—in the army he ranks as lieut colonel only—but what his pretentions as governor in his own province are i really dont know or whether he has any or not i should therefore be glad of your advice being unwilling either to dispute the point wrongfully or to give up the command to him if it is my right neither of which i would do knowingly at all events i shall keep it till i hear from you  i am c george washington   th augt      fort cumberland henry bouquet to colonel bouquet camp at fort cumberland   th augt      dear sir your favor by mr hoops has in some measure revivd a hope that was almost extinguishd of doing something this campaign we must doubtless expect    to encounter many difficulties in opening a new road thro bad grounds in a woody country of which the enemy are possest but since you hope our point may be carried i would feign expect the surmounting these obstacles tis a melancholy reflection tho to find there is even a doubt of success when so much is depending and when in all human probability we might have been in full possession of the ohio by now if rather than running ourselves into difficulties and expence of cutting an entire new road the distance we have first and last braddocks had been adopted every one knows what could have been done on the old road—few can guess what will be done on the new their being not only the difficulties of the road to encounter but the chance of a french reinforcement also but it is useless to add on this head i should rather apologise for what i have said all the waggons at this place fit for service come to you under the escort ordered for mr hoops any troops not of virginia shall be forwarded to you according to order—and i could wish most sincerely that our route was fixed that we might be in motion for we are all of us most heartily tired and sick of inactivity colo byrd in particular is really ill frazer having left this with the convoy must be with with you eer now i am very glad to    hear that your artillery pass the alligany with so much ease a letter which colo byrd recd from the genl of the   th inst gives room to imagine that the destination of the virginia troops will be fixed upon so soon as he arrives at rays town as he there expresses a desire of seeing colo byrd and i there immediately mr walker was a long time as he enformed me under doubtful orders in regard to his purchase of cattle so that he was obligd at last to pick up what he coud get at a short warning which is i believe the real reason of the cattle not having been so good as they other wise might be  i am etc george washington   september      fort cumberland john robinson to john robinson camp at fort cumberland   september      my dear sir we are still encamped here very sickly and quite dispirited at the prospect before us  that appearance of glory which we had once in view that hope that laudable ambition of serving our country and meriting its applause are now no more but dwindled into ease sloth and fatal inactivity in a word all is lost if the ways of men in power like certain ways of providence are not inscrutable but why may not for we who view the actions of great men at a distance can only form    conjectures agreeably to a limited perception and being ignorant of the comprehensive schemes which may be in contemplation might mistake egregiously in judging of things from appearances or by the lump yet every fool will have his notions—will prattle and talk away and why may not i we seem then in my opinion to act under an evil genii the conduct of our leaders if not actuated by superior orders is tempered with something i do not care to give a name to but i will say they are   or something worse to p—j—v—n  artifice to whose selfish views i ascribe the miscarriage of this expedition for nothing now but a miracle can bring this campaign to a happy issue in my last if i remember rightly i told you that i had employed my small abilities in opposing the measures then concerting to do this i not only represented the advanced season the difficulty of cutting a new road over these mountains the little time left for that service the moral certainty of its obstructing our march and the miscarriage of the expedition consequent thereupon but i endeavored to represent also the great struggle virginia had made this year in raising a second regiment upon so short a notice and the great expense of doing it and her inability for a future exertion in case of need i spoke my fears concerning the southern indians in the event of a miscarriage and in fine i spoke all unavailingly for the road was immediately begun and since then from one to two thousand men have    constantly wrought on it by the last accounts i have received they had cut it to the foot of laurel hill about thirtyfive miles and i suppose by now fifteen hundred men have taken post at a place called loyal hanna about ten miles further where our next fort is intended to be constructed we have certain intelligence that the french strength at fort duquesne on the   th ultimo did not exceed eight hundred men indians included of whom there appeared to be three or four hundred this account is corroborated on all hands—two officers of the first virginia regiment vizt chew and allen having come from thence since that time both in different parties and at different times after lying a day or two concealed in full view of the fort and observing the motions and strength of the enemy see therefore how our time has been misspent behold how the golden opportunity is lost perhaps never more to be regained how is it to be accounted for can general forbes have orders for this impossible will then our injured country pass by such abuses i hope not rather let a full representation of the matter go to his majesty let him know how grossly his glory and interest and the public money have been prostituted i wish i were sent immediately home as an aid to some other on this errand i think without vanity i could set the conduct of this expedition in its true colors having taken some pains perhaps more than any other man to dive to the bottom of it but no more    adieu my dear sir it hath long been the luckless fate of virginia to fall a victim to the views of her crafty neighbors and yield her honest efforts to promote their common interests at the expense of much blood and treasure whilst openness and sincerity have governed her measures we now can only bewail our prospects and wish for happier times but these seem to be at so remote a distance that they are indeed rather to be wished than expected colonel byrd who is really unwell joins me in compliments to you the attorneygeneral and the rest of our friends  george washington  d sept      fort cumberland governor fauquier to governor fauquier camp f cd  d sept      honble sir your favor of the   th ultimo i had the honor to receive the  0th following if you are surprized to find us still encamped at this place i shall only remark that your surprize can not well exceed my own in my last i informed your honor that a resolution was taken to open a new road from rays town to fort duquesne—it was instantly begun and since that time from one to two thousand men have wrought on it continually they had by the last accounts i received cut it to the foot of laurelhill about    miles and i suppose by this time have taken    posts at loyal hanning  0 miles farther where i understand another fort is to be built in which to deposit our provisions what time it will require to build a fort at loyal hanning and after that is accomplished what further time is necessary to cut the road thro very rugged grounds to fort duquesne grounds of which the enemy are actually possessed of and know every advantageous post to harass and dispute with us in—i say what time is required for the completion of all this i must leave to time that faithful expositor of events to reveal not caring even to guess at it myself the first division of the artillery has passed the alleghany hill and i suppose may by now be got up with the advanced working party the second division i believe may have marched by this and they talk of putting all the troops in motion immediately we have not in our stores at rays town two months provisions for the army and if the best judges are to be credited the nipping frosts will soon destroy the herbage on the mountains and then altho the communication be not quite stopped the subsistence for horses is rendered very difficult till snows and frosts prevent all intercourse with the ohio and these set in early in november the road from raystown to carlyle whence the provisions and stores chiefly come is perhaps worse than any other on the continent infinitely worse than any part of the road from hence to fort duquesne along genl braddocks road and hath already worn out the greatest  0 part of the horses that have been employed in transporting the provisions the carriage of which alone it is said and i have it from good authority stands the crown upwards of  0  every hundred weight we have certain advices that the french on the   th ult had received no new reinforcements at fort duquesne from canada and that their total strength at that garrison could not exceed  00 men indians included this intelligence is brought by two officers of the first virginia regiment vizt chew  allen—who at different times and in different parties since the aforesaid   th have been to fort duquesne and there lay in wait in view of the fort observing the works and strength for several days their accounts exactly agree and have given great satisfaction to the commanding officer at rays town from whence they were sent being corroborated by indian intelligence also a party of cherokees having been out there and some delawares just come in what a golden opportunity have we lost but this is past and i fear irretrievably gone a party of our troops    in number is now  0 miles advanced waylaying the road from whom i hope a prisoner if the enemy should be passing or repassing i sent out also the day before yesterday a sergeant and   men to fort duquesne for intelligence they will be back in fourteen days i can give your honor no satisfactory account of the general he lay ill at carlyle a long time of a flux from thence gathering a little strength he moved to shippensburgh where his disorder    returned and where i am told he now is by a letter received from him the other day he hopes soon to be at raystown where he desires to see colo byrd and myself but alas the expedition must either stand or fall by the present plan in the conference which i had with colonel bouquet and of which i gave your honor an account in my last i did among other things to avert the resolve of opening a new road represent the great expence the colony of virginia had been at to support the war the charge of raising a second regiment at so short notice the time limited for the service of it and therefore the cruelty of risquing the success of an expedition upon such precarious measures when so much depends on it and our inability to do more i then expressed my apprehensions of the southern indians in case of a miscarriage and the increase of french strength by new alliances and after this i demonstrated very clearly or endeavored so to do the time it would take us to proceed on the old road and at how much less expence even if we were obliged to get all our provisions and stores from pennsylvania and surely there is no occasion for this in fine i urged every thing then that i now can do and repeated it by letters copies of which i have now to shew if required—but urged in vain the pennsylvanians whose present as well as future interest it was to conduct the expedition thro their government and along that way because it secures at present their frontiers and the trade hereafter—a    chain of forts being erected—had prejudiced the general absolutely against this road made him believe we were the partial people and determined him at all events to pursue that rout so that their sentiments are already known on this matter and to them as instigators may be attributed the great misfortune of this miscarriage—for i think now nothing but a miracle can procure success the contractor has orders to lay in at loyal hanning for  000 men the winter whence it is imagined that our expedition for this campaign will end there should we serve to make up the troops which garrison that place our frontiers will thereby not only be exposed but the soldiers for want of clothing and proper conveniences must absolutely perish few of them having a whole coat to their backs and many none at all this is a matter i have fully and repeatedly written about these    months past i hope it will now merit the assemblys notice a major of brigade is an officer absolutely necessary for the virginia troops while there is more than one regiment—the general has repeatedly urged this matter and colo byrd who once recommended another gentleman who is now found to be too deeply engaged in indian affairs joins me in proposing captn robert stewart for this office a gentleman whose assiduity and military capacity are second to none in our service we beg the favor therefore of a commission for him and that your honor would be pleased to leave the date of it    blank in order that he may take rank before some other majors of brigade to which his longer services entitle him the first virginia regiment have augusts pay due to them and no money in the paymasters hands—this he will inform your honor more particularly of as desired captains bullen and french two cuttawbas much esteemed for their bravery and steady attachment to our interest were killed about  0 days ago on their way from winchester to this camp by the enemy of which we got very early notice it happening within   miles and sent out several parties to pursue which they did fruitlessly i have written to mr gist who had the direction of indian affairs to make out such a return as your honor requires and forward it to you he is now at raystown enclosed is a return of my regiment i believe it is exact but as six of the companies are upon the new road i cannot absolutely say what alterations have happened therein since my last advices thus sir i have given your honor a full and impartial account of the present posture of affairs here of which any use may be made you shall think proper i may possibly be blamed for expressing my sentiments so freely—but never can be ashamed of urging the truth and none but obvious facts are stated here the general i dare say from his good character can account fully and no doubt satisfactorily for these delays that surprize all who judge from appearances only but i really can not    colo byrd being very unwell has desired me to offer his compliments to your honor and an excuse which is sickness for his not writing p s upon second thought i have transmitted copies of some of the letters which i wrote to colo bouquet who commands in the generals absence upon the posture of our affairs particularly my sentiments of the new road it will give your honor some trouble to peruse them and they will at the same time shew that nothing in my power has been wanting to bring this expedition to a speedy and i hoped to a happy conclusion as i well foresaw that every delay still subjected us to further difficulties and the chance of encountering a french reinforcement which very clearly appears they had not received in the middle of august long before which might we have been there had the old road been timely adopted     george washington   th september      fort cumberland george william fairfax to mrs george william fairfax camp at fort cumberland   th september      dear madam yesterday i was honored with your short but very agreeable favor of the first inst how joyfully i catch at the happy occasion of renewing a correspondence which i feared was disrelished on your part i leave to time that never failing expositor of all things and to a monitor equally faithful in my own breast to testify in silence i now express my joy silence which in some cases i wish the present speaks more intelligently than the sweetest eloquence if you allow that any honor can be derived from my opposition to our present system of management you destroy the merit of it entirely in me by attributing    my anxiety to the animating prospect of possessing mrs custis when—i need not tell you guess yourself should not my own honor and countrys welfare be the excitement tis true i profess myself a votary of love i acknowledge that a lady is in the case and further i confess that this lady is known to you yes madame as well as she is to one who is too sensible of her charms to deny the power whose influence he feels and must ever submit to i feel the force of her amiable beauties in the recollection of a thousand tender passages that i could wish to obliterate till i am bid to revive them but experience alas sadly reminds me how impossible this is and evinces an opinion which i have long entertained that there is a destiny which has the control of our actions not to be resisted by the strongest efforts of human nature you have drawn me dear madame or rather i have drawn myself into an honest confession of a simple fact misconstrue not my meaning doubt it not nor expose it the world has no business to know the object of my love declared in this manner to you when i want to conceal it one thing above all things in this world i wish to know and only one person of your acquaintance can solve me that or guess my meaning but adieu to this till happier times if i ever shall see them the hours at present are melancholy dull neither the rugged toils of war nor the gentler conflict of a — b — s  is in my choice i dare believe you are as happy as you say    i wish i was happy also mirth good humor ease of mind and—what else—cannot fail to render you so and consummate your wishes if one agreeable lady could almost wish herself a fine gentleman for the sake of another i apprehend that many fine gentlemen will wish themselves finer eer mrs spotswood is possest she has already become a reigning toast in this camp and many there are in it who intend fortune favoring to make honorable scars speak the fullness of their merit and be a messenger of their love to her i cannot easily forgive the unseasonable haste of my last express if he deprived me thereby of a single word you intended to add the time of the present messenger is as the last might have been entirely at your disposal i cant expect to hear from my friends more than this once before the fate of the expedition will some how or other be determined i therefore beg to know when you set out for hampton and when you expect to return to belvoir again and i should be glad also to hear of your speedy departure as i shall thereby hope for your return before i get down the disappointment of seeing your family would give me much concern from any thing i can yet see tis hardly possible to say when we shall finish i dont think there is a probability of it till the middle of november your letter to captain gist i forwarded by a safe hand the moment it came to me his answer shall be carefully transmitted col mercer to whom i delivered your message    and compliments joins me very heartily in wishing you and the ladies of belvoir the perfect enjoyment of every happiness this world affords be assured that i am dear madame with the most unfeigned regard your most obedient and most obliged humble servant nb many accidents happening to use a vulgar saying between the cup and the lip i choose to make the exchange of carpets myself since i find you will not do me the honor to accept mine  george washington   th septemb      raystown governor fauquier to governor fauquier camp at raystown the   th septemb      honble sir i think it incumbent upon me to give you the following account—altho it is with very great concern i am furnished with the occasion the   th instant major grant of the highlandbattalion with a chosen detachment of  00 men marched from our advanced post at loyal hannan for fort duquesne—what to do there unless to meet the fate he did i can not certainly inform you however to get intelligence and annoy the enemy was the ostensible plan    on the   th in the night they arrived near that place formed upon the hill in two columns and sent a party to the fort to make discoveries which they accomplished accordingly—and burned a loghouse not far from the walls without interruption stimulated by this success the major kept his post and disposition until day then detached major lewis and part of his command   miles back to their baggage guard and sent an engineer with a covering party in full view of the fort to take a plan of the works—at the same time causing the revilé to beat in several different places the enemy hereupon sallied out and an obstinate engagement began for the particulars of which i beg leave to refer your honor to the enclosed letters and return of the regiment major lewis it is said met his fate in bravely advancing to sustain major grant our officers and men have acquired very great applause for their gallant behavior during the action i had the honor to be publickly complimented yesterday by the general on the occasion the havock that was made of them is a demonstrable proof of their obstinate defence having   officers killed and a  th wounded out of   major lewis who chearfully went upon this enterprise when he found there was no dissuading colonel bouquet from the attempt frequently there and afterwards upon the march desired his friends to remember that he had opposed the undertaking to the utmost he is a great loss to the regiment and is universally lamented captn bullets behavior is matter of  00 great admiration and capt walter stewart the other surviving officer distinguished himself greatly while he was able to act he was left in the field but made his escape afterwards  what may be the consequence of this affair i will not take upon me to decide but this i may venture to declare that our affairs in general appear with a greater gloom than ever and i see no probability of opening the road this campaign how then can we expect a favorable issue to the expedition i have used my best endeavors to supply my men with the necessaries they want   0 blankets i got from the general upon the promise to return them again i therefore hope your honor will direct that number to be sent to winchester for his use i must also beg the favor of having blankcommissions sent to me—it will take near a dozen for the promotions and vacancies—i must fill up the vacancies with the volunteers i have and some of the best sergeants i marched to this camp the   st instant by order of the general having little else of moment to relate i beg leave to assure your honor that i am c  0  george washington   th septr      rays town george william fairfax to mrs george wm fairfax camp at rays town   th septr      dear madam do we still misunderstand the true meaning of each others letters i think it must appear so tho i would feign hope the contrary as i cannot speak plainer without—but ill say no more and leave you to guess the rest i am now furnished with news of a very interesting nature i know it will affect you but as you must hear it from others i will state it myself the   th past then major grant with a chosen detachment of  00 men marchd from our advanced post at loyal hanna against fort duquesne on the night of the   th he arrivd at that place or rather upon a hill near to it from whence went a party and viewd the works made what observations they could and burnt a logg house not far from the walls eggd on rather than satisfied by this success major grant must needs insult the enemy next morning by beating the reveille in different places in view this causd a great body of men to sally from the fort and an obstinate engagement to ensue which was maintained on our side with the utmost efforts that bravery could yield till being overpowerd and quite surrounded they were obliged to retreat with the loss of    officers killed and     men besides wounded this is a heavy blow to our affairs here and a sad stroke upon my regiment that has lost out of   officers  0  and     that was in the action   of the former killd and a  th wounded among the slain was our dear major lewis this gentleman as the other officers also did bravely fought while they had life tho wounded in different places your old acquaintance captn bullet who is the only officer of mine that came of untouched has acquired immortal honor in this engagement by his gallant behavior and long continuance in the field of action it might be thought vanity in me to praise the behavior of my own people were i to deviate from the report of common fame—but when you consider the loss they have sustained and learn that every mouth resounds their praises you will believe me impartial what was the great end proposed by this attempt or what will be the event of its failure i cant take upon me to determine it appears however from the best accounts that the enemy lost more men then we did in the engagement thus it is the lives of the brave are often disposed of but who is there that does not rather envy than regret a death that gives birth to honor and glorious memory i am extremely glad to find that mr fairfax has escapd the dangers of the seige at louisburg already have we experienced greater losses than our army sustained at that place and have gained not one obvious advantage so miserably has this expedition been managed that i expect after a months further tryal and the loss of many more men by the sword cold and perhaps famine we shall give the expedition over as perhaps impracticable this season  0  and retire to the inhabitants condemned by the world and derided by our friends i should think our time more agreeably spent believe me in playing a part in cato with the company you mention and myself doubly happy in being the juba to such a marcia as you must make your agreeable letter containd these words my sisters and nancy gist who neither of them expect to be here soon after our return from town desire you to accept their best complimts c pray are these ladies upon a matrimonial scheme is miss fairfax to be transformed into that charming domestick—a martin and miss cary to a fa— what does miss gist turn to — a cocke  that cant be we have him here one thing more and then have done you ask if i am not tired at the length of your letter no madam i am not nor never can be while the lines are an inch asunder to bring you in haste to the end of the paper you may be tird of mine by this adieu dear madam you will possibly hear something of me or from me before we shall meet i must beg the favor of you to make my compliments to colo cary and the ladies with you and believe me that i am most unalterably   0  george washington   th september      raystown governor fauquier to governor fauquier camp at raystown the   th september      honble sir i forgot to notice in my last of the   th instant that a flag of truce was sent to fort duquesne by colo bouquet it is now returned and we learn with certainty tho few things have yet transpired that major grant with two other highland officers and major lewis with two officers of the royal americans—and one belonging to pennsylvania together with   sergeants and  0 private men were made prisoners in the late action and sent immediately to montreal from all the accounts i have yet been able to collect it appears very clear that this was either a very illconcerted or very illexecuted plan perhaps both but it seems to be generally acknowledged that major grant exceeded his orders in some particulars and that no disposition was made for engaging the troops were divided—which caused the front to give way and put the whole into confusion except the virginians commanded by captn bullet who were in the hands of providence a means of preventing all of our people from sharing one common fate this mistake i fear may be productive of bad consequences to the common cause the promoters of opening a new road either do believe or would fain have it thought so that there is time enough to accomplish our plan this season but others who judge freer from prejudice are of a  0  quite contrary opinion as the road is not yet opened halfway and not  0 days provision for the troops got the length of this place—which cannot be attributed to a juster cause than the badness of the road altho many other reasons are assigned for it we find that the frosts have already changed the face of nature among these mountains we know there is not more than a month left for enterprize we know also that a number of horses can not subsist after that time on a road stripped of its herbage—and very few there are who apprehend that our affairs can be brought to favorable issue by that period nor do i see how it is possible if every thing else answered that men halfnaked can live in tents much longer i am c george washington   october      raystown john forbes to general forbes camp at raystown   october      sir in consequence of your request of the colonels assembled at your lodgings the   th instant  i offer the plans on the other side to your consideration they express my thoughts on a line of march thro a country covered with woods and how that line of march may be formed in an instant into an order of battle the plan of the line of march and order of battle  on the other side is calculated for a forced march with fieldpieces only unincumbered with wagons it represents  0  first a line of march and secondly how that line of march may in an instant be thrown into an order of battle in the woods this plan supposes four thousand privates one thousand of whom picked men are to march in the front in three divisions each division having a fieldofficer to command it besides the commander of the whole and is always to be in readiness to oppose the enemy whose attack if the necessary precautions are observed must always be in front the first division must as the second and third ought likewise to be subdivided for the captains these subdivisions to be again divided for the subalterns and the subalterns again for the sergeants and corporals by which means every noncommissioned officer will have a party to command under the eye of a subaltern as the subalterns will have under the direction of a captain c nb i shall altho i believe it unnecessary remark here that the captains when their subdivisions are again divided are to take command of no particular part of it but to attend to the whole subdivision as the subalterns are to do with theirs each captain and subaltern acting as commandant of the division he is appointed to under the fieldofficer visiting and encouraging all parts alike and keeping the soldiers to their duty this being done the first division is so soon as the vanguard is attacked if that gives the first notice of the enemys approach to file off to the right and left and take to trees gaining the enemys flanks and surrounding them as  0  described in the second plan  the flankguards on the right which belong to the second division are immediately to extend to the right followed by that division and to form as described in the aforesaid plan the rearguard division is to follow the left flankers in the same manner in order if possible to encompass the enemy which being a practice different from any thing they have ever yet experienced from us i think may be accomplished what indians we have should be ordered to get round unperceived and fall at the same time upon the enemys rear the front and rear being thus secured there remains a body of two thousand five hundred men to form two brigades on the flanks of which six hundred men must march for the safety of them and in such order as to form a rank entire by only marching the captains and subalterns guards into the intervals between the sergeants parties as may be seen by plan the second the main body will now be reduced to nineteen hundred men which should be kept a corps de reserve to support any part that shall be found weak or forced  the whole is submitted to correction with the utmost candor by sir c  0  george washington  0 october      loyal hanna governor fauquier to governor fauquier camp at loyal hanna  0 october      honble sir colo byrd promised to apologize to you for my not writing by jenkins since which i have been honored with your second favor of the  th instant both of which now lie before me for acknowledgement my sudden march  from raystown the intent of which i presume you are already informed of allowed  0  me no time to furnish mr boyd with proper estimates for drawing the pay of our regiment and i was less anxious on that head as the officers equally with myself considered that our affairs would some how or other come to a conclusion before he could return and that it might be difficult and very unsafe for him to follow us i am very much obliged to your honor for the commissions you were pleased to send be assured sir the confidence which you have reposed in me shall never be wilfully abused i am not less obliged to your honor for the favor of returning so readily the blankets which i borrowed of the general i am however sorry to inform you that upon reviewing the six companies of my regiment at this place which had been separated from me since my last i found them deficient in the necessaries contained in the enclosed return and consequently i am under an indispensable duty of providing them or more properly of endeavoring to do so for i doubt very much the possibility of succeeding your honor therefore will not i hope be surprised should i draw on you for the amount in case of success governor sharpe in person commanded a garrison of militia from his province at fort cumberland when the magazine was blown up and had i believe his storekeeper included in the blast    my march to this post gave me an opportunity of forming a judgment of the road and i can truly say that it is indescribably bad had it not been for an accidental discovery of a new passage over the laurel   0 hill the carriages must inevitably have stopped on the other side this is a fact nobody here takes upon him to deny the general and great part of the troops c being yet behind and the weather growing very inclement must i apprehend terminate our expedition for this year at this place but as our affairs are now drawing to a crisis and a good or bad conclusion of them will shortly ensue i choose to suspend my judgment as well as a further account of the matter to a future day  george washington    november      bushy run john forbes to general forbes camp near bushy run    november      sir after the most constant labor from daybreak till night we were able to open the road to this place only about six miles from our last camp here it     was that captain shelby overtook us and presented me with yours and colonel bouquets letters enclosing one to colo armstrong all of which were forwarded to that gentleman last night by shelby as soon as the last of the enclosed came to my hands a junction with colonel armstrong this morning would have prevented the good effects of a fortified camp tonight and retarded our operations a day at least for which reason i desired him to march forward this morning at   oclock to such place as captn shelby should point out with capt gordons approbation of the ground and there secure himself as you have directed if he accomplishes that work before night he is in that event to begin opening the road towards us i shall struggle hard to be up with him tonight being but two and a half miles from his last camp i received but thirty six of the forty two axes sent by colo montgomery and those in the very worst order last night was spent in doing the needful repairs to them we have four carriages with us that follow with great ease if indians ever can be of use to us it must be now in the front for intelligence i therefore beg you will order their conductors to bring them at all events and that we may get our bullocks immediately up otherwise as our meat will be out tomorrow we shall possibly be delayed the next day in serving it out when we should be marching to the next post there was a sergeant grant of mine confined for insolent behavior to an officer of pennsylvania     and tried at the last general courtmartial but the sentence was not known when i came away altho the court sat five days before i applied thro major halkett to get him released but could not he is a very fine fellow and i am as desirous of getting him as he is to come i should be glad therefore if the nature of his office will admit of it with propriety that he was sent on accordingly george washington at night   th novem      john forbes to general forbes camp at night   th novem      sir colonel bouquets letter came to my hands just as the bearer was passing by from colonel armstrong i shall punctually observe all the directions contained therein altho i shall at the same time confess i think it much safer and more eligible to have marched briskly on to our second post leaving the road for colonel montgomery to open we should by that means have been as good as a covering party to him while we are fortifying a camp which may be of great importance to the army less time would be lost by this means and a straggling front which will ever happen in expeditious cutting would be avoided besides the probable advantage of perhaps getting into a secure camp before we might be discovered i have opened the road between seven and eight miles to day and am yet three miles short of colonel armstrong who marched at eight oclock i understand     by captain shelby who is just come from him that col armstrong is not yet begun entrenching his camp which must again retard us tomorrow forwarding provisions is highly necessary hard labor consumes them fast but all the men are in high spirits and are anxious to get on i shall be much pleased to see the indians up and am very glad to hear that mr croghan is so near at hand the number with him is not mentioned i wish they were in our front also i was extremely sorry to hear of your indisposition to day being sir yours c george washington    november      john forbes to general forbes armstrongs camp    november      sir i came to this camp about eleven oclock today having opened the road before me i should immediately have proceeded on but as the bullocks were to be slaughtered and provisions to be dressed i thought it expedient to halt here till three in the morning when i shall begin to march with one thousand men leaving colonel armstrong and five hundred more in this camp until colonel montgomery joins him i took care that the road should not be delayed by this halt for i ordered out a working party properly covered before i came here to cut it forward till night should fall upon them and then return back again i fear we have been greatly deceived with regard     to the distance from hence to fort duquesne most of the woodsmen that i have conversed with seem to think that we are still thirty miles from it i have sent out one party that way to ascertain the distance and the kind of ground between and two others to scout on the right and left for the discovery of tracks c tomorrow captn shelby and lt gist of my regiment will go off on the like service that the former of these parties has done this day under lt ryley i found three redoubts erecting for the defence of this camp mr gordon thinks that it will be sufficiently secured by these means but for my own part i do not look upon redoubts alone in this close country to be half as good as the slightest breastwork indeed i do not believe they are any security at all where there are no other works i enclose you a return of the total strength of this place and for what time they are served with provisions by which you will see how much a supply is needed and i must beg that commissaries and stilliards  may be sent forward otherwise a continual dissatisfaction will prevail as well on the part of the contractors as on that of the soldiers who think they have injustice done them in their allowance notwithstanding the fifteen bullocks which were received as provisions for four days were issued out for three only by the judgment of an officer of each corps as well as my own for i took pains to examine into it myself     i had wrote thus far when your favor of this morning came to hand i shall set out at three oclock as above leaving the highlanders to finish the redoubts according to mr gordons plan and to secure the tools until colonel montgomery comes up leaving it then to colonel bouquets option to bring or leave them we shall i am apprehensive have a great space between this post and the next as i have before observed tho i shall be a better judge tomorrow night the enclosed return shows what provisions each corps ought to have upon hand but few can make it hold out so that i must again urge the necessity of a commissary and weights also of provisions for were we all completed properly to a certain day there are yet parties and lighthorsemen coming and going who complain much on this head your chimney at this place is finished i shall take care to put up one at the next post  i shall use every necessary precaution to get timely notice of the enemys approach so that i flatter myself you need be under no apprehensions on that head a scouting party is just returned and reports that five miles advanced of this they discovered the tracks of about forty persons making towards kiskemanetes the tracks appear to have been made today or yesterday i am c     george washington    november      fort duquesne governor fauquier to governor fauquier camp at fort duquesne    november      honble sir i have the pleasure to inform you that fort duquesne or the ground rather on which it stood was possessed by his majestys troops on the   th instant the enemy after letting us get within a days march of the place burned the fort and ran away by the light of it at night going down the ohio by water to the number of about five hundred men from our best information the possession of this fort has been matter of surprise to the whole army and we cannot attribute it to more probable causes than those of weakness want of provisions and desertion of their indians of these circumstances we were luckily informed by three prisoners who providentially fell into our hands at loyal hanna at a time when we despaired of proceeding and a council of war had determined that it was not advisable to advance beyond the place above mentioned this season but the information above caused us to march on without tents or baggage and with a a light train of artillery only with which we have happily succeeded it would be tedious and i think unnecessary to relate every trivial circumstance that has happened since my last to do this if needful shall be the employment of a leisure hour when i have the pleasure to pay my respects to your honor the general purposes to wait here a few days to settle matters with the indians and then all the troops except a sufficient garrison which will i suppose be left here to secure the possession will march     to their respective governments i therefore give your honor this early notice of it that your directions relative to those of virginia may meet me timely on the road i cannot help premising in this place the hardships the troops have undergone and the naked condition they now are in in order that you may judge if it is not necessary that they should have some little recess from fatigue and time to provide themselves with necessaries for at present they are destitute of every comfort of life if i do not get your orders to the contrary i shall march the troops under my command directly to winchester from whence they may then be disposed of as you shall afterwards direct general forbes desires me to inform you that he is prevented by a multiplicity of different affairs from writing to you so fully now as he would otherwise have done and from enclosing you a copy of a letter which he has written to the commanding officer stationed on the communication from hence to winchester c relative to the little carpenters conduct a chief of the cherokees but that the purport of that letter was to desire they would deprive him of the use of arms and ammunition and escort him from one place to another to prevent his doing any mischief to the inhabitants allowing him provisions only his behavior the general thought rendered this measure necessary this fortunate and indeed unexpected success of our arms will be attended with happy effects the delawares are suing for peace and i doubt not that other tribes on the ohio will follow their example     a trade free open and upon equitable terms is what they seem much to stickle for and i do not know so effectual a way of riveting them to our interest as sending out goods immediately to this place for that purpose it will at the same time be a means of supplying the garrison with such necessaries as may be wanted and i think those colonies which are as greatly interested in the support of this place as virginia is should neglect no means in their power to establish and support a strong garrison here our business wanting this will be but half finished while on the other hand we obtain a firm and lasting peace if this end is once accomplished general forbes is very assiduous in getting these matters settled upon a solid basis and has great merit which i hope will be rewarded for the happy issue which he has brought our affairs to infirm and worn down as he is  at present i have nothing further to add but the strongest assurances of my being your honors most obedient and most humble servant      george washington   december      loyal hanna governor fauquier to governor fauquier loyal hanna   december      sir the enclosed was wrote with the intention to go by an express of the generals but his indisposition   0 prevented that express from setting out for three days afterwards and then the general thought that my waiting upon your honor would be more eligible as i could represent the situation of our affairs in this quarter more fully than could well be done by letter this i accordingly attempted but upon trial found it impracticable to proceed with despatch for want of horses now having near two hundred miles to march before i can get a supply those i at present have being entirely knocked up i shall notwithstanding endeavor to comply with the generals request as i cannot possibly be down till towards the  st of next month and the bearer may much sooner the general has in his letters told you what garrison he proposed to leave at fort duquesne  but the want of provisions rendered it impossible to leave more than two hundred men in all there these without great exertions must i fear abandon the place or perish to prevent as far as possible either of these events happening i have by this conveyance wrote a circular letter to the back inhabitants of virginia setting forth the great advantages of keeping that place the improbability of doing it without their immediate assistance that they may travel safely out while we hold that post and will be allowed good prices for such species of provisions as they shall carry unless the most effectual measures are taken early in the spring to reinforce the garrison at fort     duquesne the place will inevitably be lost and then our frontiers will fall into the same distressed condition that they have been in for some time past for i can very confidently assert that we never can secure them properly if we again lose our footing on the ohio as we consequently lose the interest of the indians i therefore think that every necessary preparation should be making not a moment should be lost in taking the most speedy and efficacious steps in securing the infinite advantages which may be derived from our regaining possession of that important country that the preparatory steps should immediately be taken for securing the communication from virginia by constructing a post at redstone creek which would greatly facilitate the supplying of our troops on the ohio where a formidable garrison should be sent as soon as the season will admit of it that a trade with the indians should be upon such terms and transacted by men of such principles as would at the same time turn out to the reciprocal advantage of the colony and the indians and which would effectually remove those bad impressions that the indians received from the conduct of a set of rascally fellows divested of all faith and honor and give us such an early opportunity of establishing an interest with them as would be productive of the most beneficial consequences on getting a large share of the furtrade not only of the ohio indians but in time of the numerous nations possessing the back country westward of it and to prevent this disadvantageous     commerce from suffering in its infancy by the sinister views of designing selfish men of the different provinces i humbly conceive it absolutely necessary that commissioners from each of the colonies be appointed to regulate the mode of that trade and fix it on such a basis that all the attempts of one colony undermining another and thereby weakening and diminishing the general system might be frustrated to effect which the general would i fancy cheerfully give his aid      although none can entertain a higher sense of the great importance of maintaining a post on the ohio than myself yet under the present circumstances my regiment is i would by no means have agreed to     leave any part of it there had not the general given an express order for it i endeavored to show that the kings troops ought to garrison it but he told me as he had no instructions from the ministry relative thereto he could not order it and our men that are left there are in such a miserable situation having hardly rags to cover their nakedness exposed to the inclemency of the weather in this rigorous season that unless provision is made by the country for supplying them immediately they must inevitably perish and if the first virginia regiment is to be kept up any longer or any services are expected therefrom should forthwith be clothed as they are by their present shameful nakedness the advanced season and the inconceivable fatigues of an uncommonly long and laborious campaign rendered totally incapable of any kind of service and sickness death and desertion must if not speedily supplied greatly reduce its numbers to replace them with equally good men will perhaps be found impossible    with the highest respect i am c george washington  0 december      williamsburg john forbes to general forbes williamsburg  0 december      sir the governors writing fully to you upon the posture of affairs here and the present system of management leaves me no room to add i was in hope a general assembly would have been called immediately but the council were of opinion that     as they had met so lately and were summoned to attend some time in february it would be inconvenient to convene them sooner so that no measures for securing the communication between fort cumberland and fort duquesne or in short any thing else can be effected or even attempted until their resolutions are known thereupon captain mcneill who commanded the first virginia regiment in my absence committed an error i am informed at raystown in confining mr hoops the commissary i am not thoroughly acquainted with the particulars of that affair but i believe from the accounts which i have received that mr hoops was equally culpable in detaining the provisions from halfstarved men this piece of rashness i am told is likely to bring mcneill into trouble i therefore beg the favor of you sir as i am well convinced mcneill had nothing in view but the welfare of his men to interpose your kind offices to settle the difference this will be doing a singular favor to captain mcneill as well as to myself i should be extremely glad to hear of your safe arrival at headquarters after a fatiguing campaign and that a perfect return of good health has

in order to strengthen the power i before had in consequence of my wifes administration i have many letters of yours in my possession unanswered but at present this serves only to advise you of the above change and at the same time to     acquaint you that i shall continue to make you the same consignments of tobacco as usual and will endeavor to increase it in proportion as i find myself and the estate benefited thereby  the scarcity of the last years crop and the high prices of tobacco consequent thereupon would in any other case have induced me to sell the estates crop which indeed is only    hhd in the country but for a present and i hope small advantage only i did not care to break the chain of correspondence that has so long subsisted and therefore have according to your desire given captn talman an offer of the whole on the other side is an invoice of some goods which i beg of you to send me by the first ship bound either to potomack or rappahannock as i am in immediate

to hand as has the goods also in good order which is more than most of the importers by that ship can boast great part of her cargo being damagd—thro the negligence tis said of the captain my brother is safe arrivd but little benefitted in point of health by his trip to england the longing desire which for many years i have had of visiting the great matrapolis of that kingdom is not in the least abated by his prejudices because i think the small share of health he enjoyed while there must have given a sensible check to any pleasures he might figure to himself and woud render any place irksome—but i am now tied by the leg and must set inclination aside the scale of fortune in america is turnd greatly in our favor and success is become the boon companion of our fortunate generals twoud be folly in me to attempt particularizing their actions since you receive accts in a channel so much more direct than from hence i am now i believe fixd at this seat with an agreable consort for life and hope to find more happiness in retirement than i ever experienced amidst a wide and bustling world—i thank     you heartily for your affectionate wishes—why wont you give me an occasion of congratulating you in the same manner none woud do it with more cordiality and true sincerity than dear sir c george washington  0 september      mount vernon to robert cary and company mount vernon  0 september      gentlemen this will make the fourth letter i have written to you since my marriage with mrs martha custis the two first served to cover invoices of such goods as i wanted and to advise you at the same time of the change in her affairs and how necessary it would be to address for the future all your letters which relate to the estate of the deceased colonel custis to me the last tended only to order insurance on fifteen hogsheads of tobacco sent by the fair american i shall now endeavor to take notice of such parts of your letters as require answering and then advise what is needful to be done as matters are circumstanced at present in regard to the former there remains no great deal to be said unless you will permit me to condemn your premature sales of the estates tobacco by whelden in which i should have thought a little delay would have appeared absolutely advisable for another reason besides that mentioned by you of an additional duty taking place and that was the great demand for tobacco and rising price in the country of which you could not be unadvised from your correspondents in virginia     however i dare say you did for the best and we must therefore be satisfied and in this place as an individual give me leave to offer you my thanks for the opposition you made to this duty had all your brethren in the trade merited our acknowledgments in the same manner this duty probably might never have been laid i remark the pains you take to show the impropriety of paying the duty of the estates tobacco when money is wanting it cannot be expected but when a sum lies in your hands it should certainly be applied that way as far as it will go i likewise observe the difficulties you have met with in settling for the interest of the bank stock but i hope that is now over unless any part or the whole should require transferring when a division of the estate is made and then timely notice will be given but till this happens it may be received and placed to the estates credit in the usual manner from this time it will be requisite that you should raise three accounts one for me another for the estate and a third for miss patty custis or if you think it more eligible and i believe it will be make me debtor on my own account for john parke custis and for miss martha parke custis as each will have their part of the estate assigned them this fall and the whole will remain under my management whose particular care it shall be to distinguish always either by letter or invoice from whom tobaccos are shipped and for whose use goods are imported in order to prevent any mistakes arising the estates credit     now in your hands may be applied towards answering the whole drafts that have been and shall be made this year and it must appear very plain from my former letters as well as from what is here said how necessary it is to send regular accounts current that by comparing them with the books here satisfactory settlements may from time to time be made to our general court the tobacco per the fair american will make its appearance i apprehend in a very irregular manner captain talman first engaged it to be sent by the cary then by the randolph and being disappointed in both i had to seek for a conveyance myself and by mere good luck got it on board captain thompson but not till i had first been at the trouble and expense of carting it across from york to james river for his craft to take it in the vessel being upon the point of sailing at that time a gentleman at norfolk where she lay promised to receive the bills of lading and send them by different opportunities under cover to you but losing my memorandum he wrote to me a month afterwards for fresh directions which i suppose did not reach him till some time after the vessel had sailed i shall endeavor to put what tobacco i can on board the cary as i understand she is to wait for the new crop it will be needless i am persuaded to bespeak your best care in the sales of it as you must be sensible the present high price of tobacco gives us room to expect extraordinary returns for this years produce so early shipped     i am possessed of several plantations on this river potomac and the fine lands of shenandoah and should be glad if you would ingenuously tell me what prices i might expect you to render for tobaccos made thereon of the same seed of that of the estates and managed in every respect in the same manner as the best tobaccos on james and york rivers are i ask this question purely for my own private information and my shipping of these crops will be governed in a great measure by the answer you may give therefore you will excuse me i hope if i again desire the favor of you to take some pains to inform yourselves exactly because should the prices differ from those of the estate i might possibly think myself deceived and be disgusted of course please to send the goods contained in the enclosed invoices and charge them as there directed i flatter myself that particular care will be taken in choosing them the want of which gives some tradesmen an opportunity of imposing upon us most vilely

inform me that my mill was in great danger of blowing i immediately hurried off all hands with shovels c to her assistance and got there myself just time enough to give her a reprieve for this time by wheeling dirt into the place which the water had washd while i was here a very heavy thunder shower came on which lasted upwards of an hour— here also i tried what time the mill requird to grind a bushel of corn and to my surprize found she was within   minutes of an hour about this old anthony attributed to the low head of water but whether it was so or not i cant say—her works being all decayd and out of order which i rather take to be the cause this bushel of corn when ground measurd near a peck more meal    wednesday apl  th    the heavy rains that had fallen in this few days past

observd that the flood tide was infinitely the best for these fish    saturday april   th    hauld the sein but without success some said it was owing to the wind setting of the shore which seems in

no   is three pecks of the earth     brought from below the hill out of the    acre field without any mixture—in no  —is two pecks of the said earth and one of marle taken out of the said field which

hill side which seemd to be purer than the other   sheep dung—   black mould taken out of the pocoson on the creek side  0 clay got just below the garden all mixd with the same quantity and sort of earth in the most effectual manner by reducing the whole to a tolerable degree of fineness and jabling them well together in a cloth in each of these divisions were planted three grains of wheat   of oats and as many of barley—all at equal distance in rows and of equal depth done by a machine made for the purpose the wheat rows are next the numberd side the oats in the middle and the barley on

got with small labor and expence but of the constancy of this stream i know nothing nor coud crawford tell me i saw none of the ore but all people agree that there is an inexhaustible fund of that that is rich but wood seems an obstacle not but that there is enough of it but the ground is so hilly and rugged as not to admit of making coal or transporting it— i did not examine the place so

for england in a ship for london affords me the best opportunity imaginable to acknowledge the receipt of your favors of the   d novr   th decr and    march which are all the letters i have received from you since those taken notice of in mine of the  0th of septr last i must confess that my disappointment in the sales of my tobacco per cozzens was a very sensible one having seen no accounts of tobacco by that ship till then under £   pr hhd and few very few indeed that did not average    and from that to    and    pounds pr hhd mine being all sweet scented and neatly managed left me no room to suspect coming in at the tail of the market the discouraging sales i have generally got for all tobacco shipped of my own growth have induced me to dispose of my last years crop in the country the price being good and certain but this may not always happen and while i can ship without loss i shall always be glad to have it in my power of consigning you a part i dare say your account current transmitted in december last is very right although i should have understood it better had you credited me for £ 0 insured on my tobacco per the integrity and made me debtor for the premio c there is another article of interest short £   which i should be glad to have explained if it is for interest on the money you have lain in advance for me i am extremely willing to     allow it thinking it just and never intending to put you to the least inconvenience on my account i hope before this letter can have reached you that you have recovered my loss of goods retaken in captain downs the french are so well drubbed and seem so much humbled in america that i apprehend our generals will find it no difficult matter to reduce canada to our obedience this summer  but what may be montgomerys fate in the cherokee country i cannot so readily determine it seems he has made a prosperous beginning having penetrated into the heart of the country and he is now advancing his troops in high health and spirits to the relief of fort loudoun but let him be wary he has a crafty subtle enemy to deal with that may give him most trouble when he least expects it  we are in pain here for the king of prussia and wish hanover safe these being events in which we are much interested     my indulging myself in a trip to england depends upon so many contingencies which in all probability may never occur that i dare not even think of such a gratification nothing however is more ardently desired but mrs washington and myself would both think ourselves very happy in the opportunity of showing you the virginia hospitality which is the most agreeable entertainment we can give or a stranger expect to find in an infant woody country like ours i am c george washington  0 august    0 mount vernon to robert cary  co london mount vernon  0 august    0 gentln    inclosed you are presented with the memorandum for receiving the interest of the bankstock signd as directed—the estate not yet being so amply settled as it ought an entire division has not been made which leaves many matters upon a instable footing and among the rest the money in your hands which has not yet been assigned to individuals altho i believe it will chiefly if not all fall into my part since it best suits my purposes to have money that can be commanded than money at interest however till matters come to a more conclusive settlement you may let the accounts stand as you have stated them charging each party with their own drafts and orders and letting the credits remain in favor of the estate as a common stock till further direction the tobacco shipped per the fair american cary and russia merchant may be applied the same way     but the present growing crop will be shipped on my own and mr parke custiss particular accounts each having our plantations allotted us and must be applied to our several credits as you will be directed so must all ye remittances hereafter to be made the insurance on the tobacco per talman was high i think higher than expected—and here gentlemen i cannot forbear ushering in a complaint of the exorbitant prices of my goods this year all of which are come to hand except those packages put on board hooper—for many years i have imported goods from london as well as other ports of britain and can truly say i never had such a penny worth before it would be a needless task to enumerate every article that i have cause to except against let it suffice to say that woolens linnens nails c are mean in quality but not in price for in this they excel indeed far above any i have ever had—it has always been a custom with me when i make out my invoices to estimate the charge of them this i do for my own satisfaction to know whether i am too fast or not and i seldom vary much from the real prices doing it from old notes and credits but the amount of your invoice exceeds my calculations above    per cent and many articles not sent that were wrote for      i must once again beg the favor of you never to send me any goods but in a potomack ship and for this purpose let me recommend captn john johnson in an annual ship of mr russells to this river johnson is a person i am acquainted with know him to be very careful and he comes past my door in his ship i am certain therefore of always having my goods landed in good time and order which never yet has happened when they come into another river this year the charming polly went into rappahannock and my goods by her received at different times and in bad order—the porter entirely drank out there came no invoice of mrs dandridges goods to me i suppose it was forgot to be inclosed       as i shall write to you again by the fleet i shall decline giving any directions about the busts till then  some time ago there was a prospect of     making a large crop of tobacco this summer but a series of wet weather for near a month with little or no intermission has caused general complaints among the planters and now it is feard that the crops will be very short the tobacco in many places being under water and drowned and in others suffering much by the spot which is always a consequence of such rains      my steward on york river writes me that he has received the goods ordered from glasgow—inclosed i address you the copy of a letter wrote from williamsburg in april last and in a letter of the  0th june i advertised you of two drafts i had made upon you the one in favor of mr jno addison for £      s 0d and the other of mr william digges for £ 0    s  d these payments were in part for a valuable purchase i had just made of abt  000 acres of land adjoining this seat there are more payments yet to make and possibly i may have occasion to draw upon you for a further sum tho not more i am well persuaded than you have effects to answer yet if at any time a prospect of advantage should lead me beyond this a little i hope their will be no danger of my bills returning i mention this rather for a matter of information in case of such an event than as a thing i ever expect to happen for my own aversion to running in debt will always secure me against a step of this nature unless a manifest advantage is likely to be the result of it since writing the foregoing i have added to my landed purchase and shall have occasion in a few days to draw upon you to the amount of about £  0 payable to mr robt trent save a bill of about £ 0 which will be passd in favor of mr clifton i am c     george washington  0 november    0 mount vernon robert mackenzie to captain robert mackenzie at venango mount vernon  0 november    0 dear sir had your favor of the   th of august come to my hands before the   th instant i should not have given you the trouble of perusing my answer to it at this late season i am sorry that you should think it necessary to introduce a request to me which is founded on reason and equity with an apology had you claimed that as a right which you seem to ask as a favor i should have thought myself wanting in that justice which is the distinguishing characteristic of an honest man to have withheld it from you but how to answer your purposes and at the same time to avoid the imputation of impertinence i am i confess more at a loss to determine that general amherst may have heard of such a person as i am is probable and this i dare venture to say is the chief knowledge he has of me how then should i appear to him in an epistolary way and to sit down and write a certificate of your behavior carries with it an air of formality that seems more adapted to the case of a soldier than that of an officer i must therefore beg the favor of you to make what use you please of this letter for sir with not more pleasure than truth i can declare to you and the world that while i had the honor of commanding the regiment your conduct both as an officer and a gentleman was unexceptionable and in every instance as far as i was capable of discerning such as to merit applause from better     judges since my time colonel byrd has been witness to your behavior and his letter recommendatory must i am persuaded do you more service than my sanguine endeavors although neither he nor any other person is more sensible of your worth or more inclined to contribute his best offices to the completion of your wishes than sir your obedient servant       george washington    july      mount vernon richard washington to richard washington mount vernon    july      dear sir since my last by mr fairfax i have had the pleasure of receiving your obliging favors of the   th october and  st of january following a mixture of bad health and indolence together has kept me from paying that due respect to your letters which i am sure they much merited at my hands till this time and now having nothing to relate that could in any wise claim your attention i think i was inclined to a further delay when it came into my head that having put six hogsheads tobacco on board the phœnix captain mcgachin to your address it would not be amiss to secure some part of the value by insurance that in case the ship should meet with the fate attending many others in the same trade i might not lose the whole and therefore sir i beg the favor of you to insure five pounds a hogshead on the tobacco accordingly     the entire conquest of canada and dispossession of the french in most parts of north america becoming a story too stale to relate in these days we are often at a loss for something to supply our letters with true it is the cherokee nation by a perfidious conduct has caused colonel grant to be sent once more into their country with an armed force but i believe their supplies from the french on mobile river come in so slac that they are more sincerely disposed to peace now than ever they were before this pacifick turn may be caused in some measure too by another regiment in the pay of this colony which is ordered to penetrate into their country by a different passage but it is generally thought that their submission will put a stop to any further progress of our arms  we have received the account of belle isles reduction and hear of another expedition fleet destined for some service of which we are ignorant but that which most engrosses our attention at this time is the congress at augsburg as i believe nothing is more sincerely desired in this part of the world than an honorable peace colo fairfax very much surprizes his friends in virginia by not writing to any of them just upon his arrival at london he favored a few with a short   0 letter advertising them of that agreeable circumstance and i have heard of no other letter that has come from him since altho i have seen some from the ladies the superscription of which has been in his handwriting i am c george washington   th aug      reverend charles green to reverend charles green  the warm springs   th aug      revd sir i should think myself very inexcusable were i to omit so good an opportunity as mr douglasss return from these springs of giving you some account of the place and of our approaches to it to begin then—we arrived here yesterday and our journey as you may imagine was not of the most agreeable sort through such weather and such roads as we had to encounter these last for  0 or    miles from hence are almost impassible for carriages not so much from the mountainous country but this in fact is very rugged as from trees that have fallen across the road and rendered the way intolerable we found of both sexes about  00 people at this place full of all manner of diseases and complaints some of which are much benefited while others find no relief from the waters—two or three doctors are here but whether attending as physicians or to drink of the waters i know not it is thought the springs will soon begin to lose their virtues and the weather get too cold for people     not well provided to remain here they are situated very badly on the east side of a steep mountain and inclosed by hills on all sides so that the afternoons sun is hid by   oclock and the fogs hang over us till   or  0 which occasion great damps and the mornings and evenings to be cool the place i am told and indeed have found it so already is supplyed with provisions of all kinds good beef and venison fine veal lambs fowls c c may be bought at almost any time but lodgings can be had on no terms but building for them and i am of opinion that numbers get more hurt by their manner of lying than the waters can do them good had we not succeeded in getting a tent and marquee from winchester we should have been in a most miserable situation here in regard to myself i must beg leave to say that i was much overcome with the fatigue of the ride and weather together however i think my fevers are a good deal abated although my pains grow rather worse and my sleep equally disturbed what effect the waters may have upon me i cant say at present but i expect nothing from the air—this certainly must be unwholesome i purpose to stay here a fortnight and longer if benefitted i shall attempt to give you the best discription i can of the stages to this place that you may be at no loss if after this account you choose to come up toulson i should recommend as the first majr hamiltons or israel thompsons the  d ye one about  0 the other    miles distant from thence     you may reach henry vanmeters on opeckon creek or captain peariss   miles on this side which will be about    miles and then your journey will be easy the following day to this place i have made out a very long and a very dirty letter but hurry must apologize for the latter and i hope your fondness will excuse the former please to make my compliments acceptable to mrs green and miss bolan and be assured revd sir that with a true respect i remain c p s if i could be upon any certainty of your coming or could only get   days previous notice of your arrival i would get a house built such as are here erected very indifferent indeed they are tho for your reception  0 augt since writing the above mr douglass lost his horse and was detained but i met with a fairfax man returning home who is to be back again immediately for his wife this person i have hired to carry some letters to mrs washington under whose cover this goes by him you are furnished with an opportunity of honoring me with your commands if you retain any thoughts of coming to this place i think myself benefited by the waters and am now with hopes of their making a cure of me little time will show now     george washington  0 october      mount vernon richard washington to richard washington mount vernon  0 october      dear sir since my last of the   th july i have in appearance been very near my last gasp the indisposition then spoken of increased upon me and i fell into a very low and dangerous state i once thought the grim king would certainly master my utmost efforts and that i must sink in spite of a noble struggle but thank god i have now got the better of the disorder and shall soon be restored i hope to perfect health again i dont know that i can muster up one tittle of news to communicate in short the occurrences of this part of the world are at present scarce worth reciting for as we live in a state of peaceful tranquillity ourselves so we are at very little trouble to inquire after the operations against the cherokees who are the only people that disturb the repose of this great continent and who i believe would gladly accommodate differences upon almost any terms not i conceive from any apprehensions they are under on account of our arms but because they want the supplies which we and we only can furnish them with we catch the reports of peace with gaping mouths and every person seems anxious for a confirmation of that desirable event provided it comes as no doubt it will upon honorable terms      on the other side is an invoice of clothes which i beg the favor of you to purchase for me and to send them by the first ship bound to this river as they are designed for wearingapparel for myself i have committed the choice of them to your fancy having the best opinion of your taste i want neither lace nor embroidery plain clothes with a gold or silver button if worn in genteel dress are all i desire i have hitherto had my clothes made by one charles     lawrence in old fish street but whether it be the fault of the tailor or the measure sent i cant say but certain it is my clothes have never fitted me well i therefore leave the choice of the workman to your care likewise i enclose a measure and for a further insight i dont think it amiss to add that my stature is six feet otherwise rather slender than corpulent          george washington  0 october      mount vernon george william fairfax to george william fairfax mount vernon  0 october      dear sir i am sorry to be the messenger of the news but it is incumbent upon me to inform you of the death of the mare you committed to my care how she died i am able to give you but a very unsatisfactory account for on the  rd inst i set out for frederick and left her to all appearance as well as a creature could be mr green and i observing a day or two before how fat and frolicksome she seemed and on my return in   days time i got the news of her death she discovered no visible signs of ailment as i am told in the morning of the  th when let out of the stable but before night was swelled to a monstrous size and died in a few hours bishop my old servant opened her but could perceive no hurt bruise or other apparent cause of so sudden a death which inclines me to think it was occasioned by eating blasted corn a piece of which i had in ground i wanted to clean and never could fence my chariot horses of it the rest consequently followed and this i am persuaded puffed her up in the manner related she had no foal in her which assures me that she never would breed as i am convinced she had a competent share of ariels performances not content with which she was often catched in amorous mood with a young horse of mine notwithstanding my utmost endeavors to keep them under you will feel the loss of this accident more sensibly but can not be more concerned at the account than i was for     i had pleased myself with the thoughts of delivering her to you in fine order when you returned to below we received the news of your return with a great deal of pleasure and if there is any thing previous to it in which i can be serviceable i hope you will command me you did me singular services in a like case and why wont you give me an opportunity of making a grateful return mrs washington writes to mrs fairfax under this cover to whom and miss fairfax please to offer my best wishes i am c           george washington    april      virginia charles lawrence to chs lawrence tailor in london virginia    april      mr lawrence be pleased to send me a genteel suit of cloaths made of superfine broad cloth handsomely chosen i should have inclosed you my measure but in a general way they are so badly taken here that i am convinced it would be of very little service i would have you therefore take measure of a gentleman who wares wellmade cloaths of the following size to wit   feet high and proportionably made—if any thing rather slender than thick for a person of that highth with pretty long arms and thighs you will take care to make the breeches longer than those you sent me last and i would have you keep the measure of the cloaths you now make by you and if any alteration is required in my next it shall be pointed out note for your further government and knowledge of my size i have sent the inclosed and you must observe that from the coat end— to n°    n°   is the size over the breast and hips n°   over the belly and n°   round the arm and from the breeches end to n° a is for waistband b thick of the thigh c upper button hole d kneeband—and e for length of breeches—therefore if you take measure of a person about   feet high of this bigness i think you cant go amiss you must take notice the inclosd is the exact size without any allowance for seams c      george washington april      robert stewart to robert stewart april      my dear stewart your letters of the   th january and  d of march came to my hands at the same time about the  0th inst i knew of no ship then on the point of sailing for any part of great britain and therefore have been unavoidably silent till now indeed i could have given but a very unsatisfactory answer before this i participated in the pleasing prospect which seemed to flatter your wishes about the time of writing your first letter as much as i felt for its reverse in the next but human affairs are always chequered and vicissitudes in this life are rather to be expected than wondered at i wish my dear stewart that the circumstances of my affairs would have permitted me to have given you an order upon any person in the world i might add—for £ 00 with as much ease  propriety as you seem to require it or even for twice that sum if it would make you easy but alas to show my inability in this respect i enclose you a copy of mr carys last account current against me which upon my honor and the faith of a christian is a true one and transmitted to me with the additional aggravation of a hint at the largeness of it messrs hanburys have also a ballance against me and i have no other correspondents in england with whom i deal unless it be with a namesake for trifles such as   0 cloaths and for these i do not know whether the ballance is for or against me this upon my soul is a genuine account of my affairs in england here they are a little better because i am not much in debt i doubt not but you will be surprized at the badness of their condition unless you will consider under what terrible management and disadvantages i found my estate when i retired from the publick service of this colony and that besides some purchases of lands and negroes i was necessitated to make adjoining me in order to support the expences of a large family i had provisions of all kinds to buy for the first two or three years and my plantation to stock in short with every thing—buildings to make and other matters which swallowd up before i well knew where i was all the money i got by marriage nay more brought me in debt and i believe i may appeal to to your own knowledge of my circumstances before i do not urge these things my dear sir in order to lay open the distresses of my own affairs on the contrary they should forever have remained profoundly secret to your knowledge did it not appear necessary at this time to acquit myself in your esteem and to evince my inability of exceeding £ 00 a sum i am now laboring to procure by getting money to purchase bills of that amount to remit to yourself that mr cary may have no knowledge of the transaction since he expected this himself and for which my regard for you will disappoint him—a regard of that high nature that i could never see you     uneasy without feeling a part and wishing to remove the cause and therefore when you complained of the mortification of remaining a subaltern in a corps you had frequently commanded the subs of i wanted you out and hoped it might be effected—but i shall have done on the subject giving me leave to add only that in case you should not have a call for the money and your letter speaks of this you will then be so good as to pay it to mr cary to whom i believe it will be no disagreeable tender and advise me thereof the inclosed will inform you of what i have wrote to him on this head which letter you may deliver or destroy at pleasure i am exceedingly obliged to you for your kind offers of services in london but i have nothing to give you the trouble of i write in very great haste and know i may depend upon your friendship to excuse any thing and every thing amiss in the letter  george washington    august      mount vernon robert stewart to robert stewart mount vernon    august      my dear stewart by captain walter stuart i am favored with an opportunity of acknowledging the receipt of your     letter of the  th of june and at the same time of forwarding the copy of my former which was in readiness before that came to hand and which i incline to send notwithstanding the original is got to hand because it contains the second bills and other matters entire as they ought to have been sent and as i dare say mr stuart will be so good as to deliver another tempest has arose upon our frontiers and the alarm spread wider than ever in short the inhabitants are so apprehensive of danger that no families stand above the conococheague road and many are gone off below it their harvests are in a manner lost and the distresses of the settlement appear too evident and manifold to need description in augusta many people have been killed and numbers fled and confusion and despair prevail in every quarter at this instant a calm is taking place which forebodes some mischief to colonel bouquet at least those who wish well to the convoy are apprehensive for him since it is not unlikely that the retreat of all the indian parties at one and the same time from our frontiers is a probable proof of their assembling a force somewhere and for some particular purpose none more likely than to oppose his march      it was expected that our assembly would have been called in such exigences as these but its concluded as i have been informed that an assembly without money could be no eligible plan to comprehend the meaning of this expression you must know the board of trade at the instance of the british merchants have undertaken to rebuke us in the most ample manner for our paper emissions and therefore the governor and council have directed one thousand militia to be employed for the protection of the frontiers five hundred of whom are to be drafted from hampshire c and to be under the command of colonel stephen whose military courage and capacity says the governor are well established the other five hundred from the southern frontier counties are to be conducted by major lewis so that you may readily conceive what an     enormous expense must attend these measures stephen immediately upon the indians retiring advanced to fort cumberland with two hundred or two hundred and fifty militia in great parade and will doubtless achieve some signal advantage of which the public will soon be informed i think i have now communicated the only news which these parts afford it is of a melancholy nature indeed and we cannot tell how or when it is to end i hope you may have got matters settled to your liking before this time i should rejoice to hear it as i should at every thing that gives you pleasure or profit mrs washington makes a tender of her compliments and you may be assured that i am with great sincerity dear sir your most obedient and affectionate servant notes on the dismal swamp  october         from suffolk to pocoson swamp  is reckoned about   miles and something better than   perhaps   miles from colo reddicks     mill run where the road crosses it the land within this distance especially after passing willis reddicks is level and not bad the banks down to this pocoson swamp declines gradually and the swamp appears to be near    yards over but no water in it at present note—willis reddicks plantation seems to be a good one ye land being level and stiff so does henry reddicks above from pocoson swamp to cyprus swamp which conducts more water into the great dismal swamp than any one of the many that leads into it is about  ½ miles this also is dry at present but appears to be  0 or    yards across in the wettest part the next swamp to this is called mossey swamp and distant about   miles near this place lives john reddick on good land but hitherto from pocoson swamp the land lyes flat wet and poor this swamp is  0 yards over and dry between cyprus swamp and the last mentioned one we went on horseback not less than ½ mile into the great swamp dismal without any sort of difficulty the horse not sinking over the fetlocks the first quarter however abounding in pine and gallberry bushes the soil being much intermixed with sand but afterwards it grew blacker and richer with many young reeds and few pines—and this it may be observed here is the nature of the swamp in general from mossey swamp to a branch and a large one it is of oropeak not less than  0 yards over is reckoned   miles two miles short of which is a large plantation belonging to one brindle  near to which on the south side passes the carolina line the main swamp of oropeak is about ½ a mile onwards from this where stands the widow norflets mi  luke sumners plantations this swamp cannot be less than  00 yards across but does not nevertheless discharge as much water as cyprus swamp at the mouth of this swamp is a very large meadow of   or  000 acres held by sumner widow norflet marmaduke norflet powel and others and valuable ground it is     from oropeak swamp to loosing swamp is about   miles and this  0 yards across from hence again to bassey swamp the lower road may be allowed   miles more but this swamp seems trifling and from bassey swamp to horse pool which is the last and including swamp running into the dismal is about   miles more and    yards across only the whole land from pocoson swamp to this place and indeed all the way to pequemin bridge is in a manner a dead level wet and cold in some place sandy in others and generally poor this lastnamed swamp viz the horse pool is called   miles from the upper bridge on pequemin river within a mile of which lives one elias stallens and within   miles is the lower bridge from whence to the bridge or ferry over little river is    measured miles ye course nearly due south as it likewise is from suffolk to the said bridge ye dismal running that course from that place from little river bridge or ferry to ralphs ferry on paspetank is i think we were told about    miles the course east or northeast and from thence if the ferry is not crossed along up the west side of the river to the river bridge of the said paspetank is reckoned—miles and about a north west course ye dismal bordering close upon the left all the way note ye above account is from information only for instead of taking that rout we crossed from elias stallens one mile above the upper bridge on pequemin across to a set of people which inhabit a small slip of sand between the said river pequemin and ye dismal swamp and from thence along a new cut path through the main swamp northwardly course for five miles to the inhabitants of what they call new found land which is thick settled very rich land and about   miles from the aforesaid river bridge of paspetank the arm of dismal which we passed through to get to this new land as it is called is  ¼ miles measured little or no timber in it but very full of reeds and excessive rich through this we carried horses without any great difficulty this land was formerly esteemed part of the dismal but being higher though full of reeds people ventured to settle upon it and as it became more open it became more dry and is now prodigious fine land but subject to wets and unhealthiness     it is to be observed here that the tide or still water that comes out of the sound up pequemin river flows up as high as stallens and the river does not widen much until it passes the lower bridge some little distance at ralphs ferry upon paspetank the river is said to be   miles over and decreases in width gradually to the bridge called river bridge where it is about  0 yards across and affords sufficient water for new england vessels to come up and load from what observations we were capable of making it appeared as if the swamp had very little fall i mean the waters out of the great swamp into the heads of these rivers which seems to be a demonstration that the swamp is much lower on the south and east sides because it is well known that there is a pretty considerable fall on the west side through all the drains that make into nansemond river and the western branch of elizabeth at the north end of the dismal  from the river bridge of paspetank to an arm of the dismal at a place called   miles bridge is reckoned   miles and a branch of paspetank twice crossed in the distance this arm of the dismal is equally good and rich like the rest and runs as we are informed    or  0 miles easterly and has an outlet as some say into curratuck inlet by north west river or tulls creek but these accounts were given so indistinctly as not to be relied upon however it is certain i believe that the water does drain off at the east end somewhere in which case a common causeway through at ye crossing place would most certainly lay all that arm dry from this place which is   miles over to the carolina line is     about   miles and from thence to north west landing on north west river a branch of curratuck is   miles more note the carolina line crosses the swamp in a west direction and is    miles from the place where it enters to its coming out of the same near brindles plantation  flats and small craft load at north west landing to the great bridge from north west landing is accounted    miles the lands good as they are on all this east side and highly esteemed valued in general according to the proprietors own accounts from  0 to £  per acre but we were told they were to be had for less this great bridge is upon the south branch of elizabeth river and about  0 miles from norfolk and heads in the dismal as does likewise north west river paspetank little river and pequemin  from the great bridge to colonel tuckers mills is about   miles within which distance several small creeks making out of south river head up in the dismal farleys plantation at the forks of the road is reckoned   miles from the aforesaid mills near to which the dismal runs from hence to roberts ordinary is   miles and from thence to suffolk  0 more the lands from the great bridge to within a mile or two of roberts is generally sandy and indifferent from hence to cowpers mill they are good and from thence to colonel reddicks mean again note from the river bridge on paspetank to the great bridge on south river the road runs nearly north and from thence to farleys plantation it seems to be about west from this again to colonel reddicks or suffolk south west and from thence to     pequemin bridge and little river south as before mentioned—the swamp bordering near to the road all the way round in some places close adjoining and in others   and   miles distant   00      george washington  0 august—     to robert cary  co  0 august—     gentlemen since my last of the first of may i have received the goods by boyes likewise the nails per watson with letters accounts of sales accounts current c which accompanied them as also another letter of the   th of march by capt hooper it might possibly answer very little purpose were i to enter into a minute detail of the reasons that have caused me to fall so much in arrears to you and therefore i shall not trouble you fully with the particulars at this time but content myself with observing in as few words as the nature of the subject will admit of that in whatsoever light it may appear to you it is not less evidently certain that mischances rather than misconduct hath been the causes of it for it was a misfortune that seasons and chance should prevent my making even tolerable crops in this part of the country for three years successively and it was a misfortune likewise when they were made that i should get little or nothing for them it may also be looked upon as unlucky at least that the debts which i thought i had collected and actually did remit to you should be paid in bills void of credit and as things have turned out and you have  0  such occasion for your money it is unlucky likewise that i made some purchases of land  slaves in this country since it obliged me to apply more of the current money which was due to the estate here towards the payment thereof than i expected and of consequence more of the sterling ballance in your hands to the credit of master custis in order to assign him his full dividend of the personal estate not conceiving in the least degree that i should have occasion for more of it than would remain after such application was made because had these bills been answered had my crops proved good and sold well the ballance i think could never have been against me however to be as short as possible to remove the seeming apprehension expressed in yours of the   th of february of your suffering in point of interest for the money you then discovered you stood in advance for me i wrote you on the first of may following that i had no sort of objections to allowing interest from thence forward and desired you would charge it accordingly untill the debt was paid not desiring that you or any body else should suffer in the most trivial instances on my account and i shall now in consequence of your other letter of the   th of march beg leave to inform you in terms equally sincere and direct that it is not in my power i should add in a manner convenient and agreable to myself to make remittances faster than my crops and perhaps some few occasional sums which may fall in my way will furnish me with the means but if notwithstanding you cannot be content with this mode  0  of payments you have only to advise me of it and i shall hit upon a method tho i would choose to avoid it that will at once discharge the debt and effectually remove me from all further mention of it for i must confess i did not expect that a correspondent so steady and constant as i have proved and was willing to have continued to your house while the advantages were in any degree reciprocal would be reminded in the instant it was discovered how necessary it was for him to be expeditious in his payments reason and prudence naturally dictate to every man of common sense the thing that is right and you might have rested assured that so fast as i could make remittances without distressing myself too much my inclinations would have prompted me to it because in the first place it is but an irksome thing to a free mind to be any ways hampered in debt and in the next place i think i have discovered no intentions since i have found how the ballance was likely to turn of increasing that debt unless it should appear in the amount of my invoices last year which greatly indeed exceeded my expectations but will be ballenced i hope by the contracted one of this year but on the contrary all the willingness i could under the accidents that have happened of decreasing it to the utmost of my power but i have already run into much greater prolixity on this head than i promised or intended your answer will determine my measures and upon this issue it must rest      0       george washington   march      mount vernon carlyle adam stephens messrs carlyle  adam mount vernon   march      gentlemen so soon as mr lund washington returns from frederic i shall cause my wheat to be deliveed at your landing on four miles run creek if flats can get to it conveniently but previous to this i should be glad to know determinately upon what terms you expect to receive it that is whether by weight or measure i once thought i had agreed with colonel carlyle at fiftyeight pounds to the bushel but it seems it was otherwise be that as it will you may believe me sincere when i tell you that it is a matter of very great indifference to me whether it is fixed at this or suffered to stand as it is consequently at any greater weight you may be assured i never shall it being a thing extremely doubtful from every trial i have been able to make with steelyards whether i should gain or lose by a contract of this kind the wheat from some of my plantations by one pair of steelyards will weigh upwards of sixty pounds by another pair less than sixty pounds and from some other places it does not weigh fiftyeight pound and  0  better wheat than i now have i do not expect to make during the term of our contract at least whilst i continue to sow a good deal of ground the only reason therefore which inclines me to sell by weight at a medium which i think just and equitable is that it may be a means of avoiding all kinds of controversy hereafter for i am persuaded that if either of us gains by it it must be you i may be encouraged indeed to bestow better land to the growth of wheat than old corn ground and excited perhaps to a more husbandlike preparation of it but to do either of these is much more expensive than the method now practised and in fact may not be so profitable as the slovenly but easy method of raising it in corn ground if it should and my wheat be the better for it thereby it is a truth i believe universally acknowledged that for every pound it gains after it is once got to a middling weight it increases the flour in a tenfold proportion you were saying that the standard for wheat in philadelphia was fiftyeight pounds and at lancaster sixty pounds i have taken some pains to inquire likewise into this matter and am informed that fiftyeight is a much more general weight than the other all over pennsylvania and maryland where their wheat is better than ours can be till we get into the same good management and colonel tuckers miller a man from the northward upon high wages whom i saw whilst i was last below assured me that very few bushels out of the many thousands of wheat which he receives for colonel tucker reached fiftyeight  0  pounds however that you may not think i have other motives than those declared for mentioning these things i shall only observe that as you are sensible by my present contract i am not restricted to weight but obliged only to deliver clean wheat and as good as the year and seasons will generally admit of i will nevertheless in order to remove every cause of dispute which can possibly arise fix the weight if it is agreeable to you at fiftyeight pounds per bushel and to be paid a penny for every pound over that weight and deduct a penny for every pound it is under if you do not choose this the contract must then remain as it now stands i am c george washington aug        mount vernon burwell bassett to col burwell bassett mount vernon aug        dear sir by a craft sent around by capt boyes we had the pleasure to hear you were all well but suffering with the drought as we are we have never had the ground wet in this neighborhood since the heavy rains which fell about the first of may in june early we had a shower that refreshed the corn and gave a little start to hemp but the dry weather which followed and hath since continued renders our prospects truely melancholy however not  0 miles from hence in the forest they are perfectly seasonable and have promising crops of corn and tobacco which is a favorable circumstance for us as our wants of bread may be supplied from thence to render my misfortunes  0  more compleat i lost most of my wheat by the rust so that i shall undergo the loss of a compleat crop here and am informed that my expectations from below are not much better i have not yet heard how you succeeded in electioneering but there was little room to doubt of yours i changed the scene from frederick to this county and had an easy and creditable pool  and was preparing to attend when the proclamation for proroguing the assembly came to hand on the   th ult i am convinced at the same time that the governor had no inclination to meet an assembly at this juncture the bearer waits i have only time therefore to add my compliments to mrs bassett and family   0  george washington  0 september      mount vernon francis dandridge to francis dandridge london mount vernon  0 september      sir if you will permit me after six years silence—the time i have been married to your niece—to pay my respects to you in this epistolary way i shall think myself happy in beginning a correspondence which cannot but be attended with pleasure on my side  0  i should hardly have taken the liberty sir of introducing myself to your acquaintance in this manner and at this time lest you should think my motives for doing of it arose from sordid views had not a letter which i received some time this summer from robert cary esqr  co given me reasons to believe that such an advance on my side would not be altogether disagreeable on yours before this i rather apprehended that some disgust at the news of your nieces marriage with me—why i could not tell—might have been the cause of your silence upon that event and discontinuing a correspondence which before then you had kept up with her but if i could only flatter myself that you would in anywise be entertained with  0  the few occurrences that it might be in my power to relate from hence i should endeavor to atone for my past remissness in this respect by future punctuality at present few things are under notice of my observation that can afford you any amusement in the recital the stamp act imposed on the colonies by the parliament of great britain engrosses the conversation of the speculative part of the colonists who look upon this unconstitutional method of taxation as a direful attack upon their liberties and loudly exclaim against the violation what may be the result of this and of some other i think i may add illjudged measures i will not undertake to determine but this i may venture to affirm that the advantage accruing to the mother country will fall greatly short of the expectations of the ministry for certain it is that our whole substance does already in a manner flow to great britain and that whatsoever contributes to lessen our importations must be hurtful to their manufacturers and the eyes of our people already beginning to open will perceive that many luxuries which we lavish our substance in great britain for can well be dispensed with whilst the necessaries of life are mostly to be had within ourselves this consequently will introduce frugality and be a necessary stimulation to industry if great britain therefore loads her manufacturies with heavy taxes will it not facilitate these measures they will not compel us i think to give our money for their exports whether we will or not and certain i   0 am none of their traders will part from them without a valuable consideration where then is the utility of these restrictions as to the stamp act taken in a single view one and the first bad consequence attending it i take to be this our courts of judicature must inevitably be shut up for it is impossible or next of kin to it under our present circumstances that the act of parliament can be complied with were we ever so willing to enforce the execution for not to say which alone would be sufficient that we have not money to pay the stamps there are many other cogent reasons to prevent it and if a stop be put to our judicial proceedings i fancy the merchants of great britain trading to the colonies will not be among the last to wish for a repeal of it      i live upon potomack river in fairfax county about ten miles below alexandria and many miles distant from any of my wifes relations who all reside upon york river and whom we seldom see more than once a year and not always that my wife who is very well and master and miss custis children of her former marriage all join in making a tender of their duty and best respects to yourself and their aunt my compliments to your lady i beg may also be made acceptable and that you will do me the justice to believe that i am dear sir your most obedient humble servant       george washington   july      mount vernon joh thompson to captain joh thompson mount vernon   july      sir with this letter comes a negro tom which i beg the favor of you to sell in any of the islands you may go to for whatever he will fetch and bring me in return from him       one hhd of best molasses   one hhd of best rum   one barrel of lymes if good and cheap   one pot of tamarinds containing about  0 lbs   two small pot of mixed sweetmeats about   lbs each and the residue much or little in good old spirits that this fellow is both a rogue and a runaway tho he was by no means remarkable for the former and never practised the latter till of late i shall not pretend to deny but that he is exceeding healthy strong and good at the hoe the whole neighborhood can testify and particularly mr johnson and his son who have both had him under them as foreman of the gang which gives me reason to hope he may with your good management sell well if kept clean and trimd up a little when offered for sale i shall very chearfully allow you the customary commissions on this affair and must beg the favor of you lest he should attempt his escape to keep him handcuffed till you get to sea or in the bay after which i doubt not but you may make him very useful to you i wish you a pleasant and prosperous passage and a safe and speedy return           george washington    june      mount vernon john posey to captain john posey mount vernon    june      sir it is difficult for me to tell which was greatest my surprise or concern at finding by your letter of the  0th that instead of being able with the money i agreed to lie somewhat longer out of to discharge your debts that you wanted to borrow a further sum of £ 00 to answer this purpose i was in hopes and you gave me the strongest assurance to believe that when i lent you and very inconvenient it was for me to do it the first sum of £ 00 you could therewith not only discharge all your creditors but in two years time sink the principal which was lent to effect that end how it comes to pass then that instead of being prepared in twice two years to discharge my claim you should require £ 00 more to satisfy others is as i at first said entirely beyond my comprehension and leaves but too much cause to apprehend that if you could be supplied with the further sum required it would afford but temporary relief and that at the end of any other prefixed period you would be as unprepared and as reluctantly then as now part with your effects to discharge this debt thinking it equally hard to be forced into compliance for permit me to say again if you have not been able in the course of four years to lay up any thing towards sinking even the interest of a sum which you said would entirely clear you of all demands what prospect can you possibly have to expect when £ 00 more and probably this would be insufficient is added to the other score of     between eight and nine hundred that you will have it in your power to effect this end when even the interest thereof is a pretty little income and would be such a moth in your estate as would inevitably destroy it be your notions of saving and industry extended to never so high a degree indeed sir the only purpose it could possibly answer would be to put the evil day off for a moment in comparison and then like most things swelled beyond their natural bounds burst upon you like a torrent and redouble your distresses besides you really deceive yourself greatly in estimating your effects as you will unhappily experience you have viewed them but on one side considering only what they cost you not what they will sell at which is a delusive way of calculating for you will find that many things which you perhaps have lavished large sums in the purchase of in order to gratify your own taste will neither suit nor probably please others so in respect to buildings which are rarely considered in the purchase of lands and principally i presume from the same causes especially upon small bits of land divested of wood and timber i wish with all my heart you may be strengthened by some able and friendly hand in such a manner as to keep your effects together provided it may turn to your future good in enabling you to work thro the load of debt you seem to be entangled in but that it is entirely out of my power without selling part of my own estate to contribute further thereto you may easily be convinced of when i tell you and affirm it that i find it next to impossible to extract     any part of the money which is due to me that i have struggled to the utmost of my power for two years past unsuccessfully to raise four or five hundred pounds to lend a very particular friend of mine who i know must sell part of his estate without it and that i have not yet discharged the sums you involved me in the payment of before having my bond out to mr greens estate for the £  0 you borrowed of him i cannot raise money to discharge it altho i have used my true endeavors for that purpose add to these some engagements of my own which there is a necessity of complying with or doing acts of injustice how absurd and idle would it be then under these circumstances to enter myself security for the payment of your debts unless i foresaw some prospect of raising the money true it is some of your creditors might agree to wait others tis presumeable would not and certain it is pay day must come to all what then is to be done to tell a man who had been disappointed from time to time and at last had waited in confidence of receiving his money from me that i was unprovided with the means of satisfying his demand would be galling to me unjust to him and what i can by no means think of practising the only favor therefore that is in my power to shew you is to be easy and forbearing in my own demands which i shall endeavor to do as long as i can with any sort of convenience to myself notwithstanding i am in want of the money and to point out any person who could lend so much money even if they     liked the security i am equally at a loss to do but few there are i believe who would choose to risk their money unless influenced by motives of compassion upon such hazardous and perishable articles as negroes stock and chattels which are to be swept off by innumerable distempers and subject to many accidents and misfortunes so upon the whole you will excuse me i hope if i am inclined to offer you the same advice i would give to my brother were he under the same circumstances and that is if you find it impracticable to keep your estate together for at least three or four years till the country i mean the indebted part of it can emerge a little from the distress it must unavoidably fall into from the pressing of creditors and want of cash then to sell off immediately i mean this fall at furthest before cash grows into greater demand which it inevitably will do as our currency is called in and every thing of consequence sell worse therewith discharging all your debts beginning with the sales of such things as can be best spared and so raising to negroes and even land if requisite for if the whole should go there is a large field before you an opening prospect in the back country for adventurers where numbers resort to and where an enterprising man with very little money may lay the foundation of a noble estate in the new settlements upon monongahela for himself and posterity the surplus money which you might save after discharging your debts would possibly secure you as much land as in the course of twenty years would sell for five     times your present estate for proof of which only look to frederick and see what fortunes were made by the hites and first taking up of those lands nay how the greatest estates we have in this colony were made was it not by taking up and purchasing at very low rates the rich back lands which were thought nothing of in those days but are now the most valuable lands we possess undoubtedly it was and to pursue this plan is the advice i would offer my brother were he in your situation but to you i only drop it as a hint for your serious reflection because i do not expect nor would by any means wish to see you adopt any scheme of mine without duly attending to it weighing and well considering of it in all points and advising with your friends i would only ask whether it would be better to labor under a load of debt where you are which must inevitably keep you in continual anxiety and dread of your creditors be selling the produce of your labour at under value the never failing consequence of necessitous circumstances with other evils too obvious to need enumeration and which must forever lend a helping hand to keep you low and distressed or to pluck up resolution at once and disengage yourself of those incumbrances and vexations abiding where you are if you can save your land and have a prospect of reaping future advantages from it or to remove back where there is a moral certainty of laying the foundation of good estates to your children—i say i would but ask which of these two is the best and leave you to think of     them at leisure with the assurance on my part that what i have propounded to you on this subject proceeds from the utmost sincerity and candor and if you will have recourse to the publick gazettes you may perceive by the number of estates which are continually advertising for sale that you are not the only one under misfortune and that many good families are retiring into the interior parts of the country for the benefit of their children some of the best gentlemen in this country talk of doing so who are not drove by necessity but adopt the scheme from principles of gain whatever resolution you may come to i wish you success in it george washington    september      mount vernon william crawford to william crawford  mount vernon    september      dear sir from a sudden hint of your brother val i wrote to you a few days ago in a hurry since which having had more time for reflection i am now set down in order to write more deliberately and with greater precision to you on the subject of my last letter     desiring that if any thing in this should be found contradictory to that letter you will wholly be governed by what i am now going to add i then desired the favor of you as i understood rights might now be had for the lands which have fallen within the pennsylvania line to look me out a tract of about fifteen hundred two thousand or more acres somewhere in your neighborhood meaning only by this that it may be as contiguous to your own settlement as such a body of good land could be found and about jacobs cabins or somewhere on those waters i am told this might be done it will be easy for you to conceive that ordinary or even middling land would never answer my purpose or expectation so far from navigation and under such a load of expenses as these lands are encumbered with no a tract to please me must be rich of which no person can be a better judge than yourself and if possible to be good and level could such a piece of land as this be found you would do me a singular favor in falling upon some method to secure it immediately from the attempts of any other as nothing is more certain than that the lands cannot remain long ungranted when once it is known that rights are to be had for them what mode of proceeding is necessary in order to accomplish this design i am utterly at a loss to point out to you but as your own lands are under the same circumstances selfinterest will naturally lead you to an inquiry i am told that the land or surveyors office is kept at carlisle if so i am of   0 opinion that colonel armstrong an acquaintance of mine has something to do in the management of it and i am persuaded would readily serve me to him therefore at all events i will write by the first opportunity on that subject that the way may be prepared for your application if you should find it necessary to make one to him whatever trouble and expense you may be engaged in on my behalf you may depend upon being thankfully repaid it is possible but i do not know that it really is the case that pennsylvania customs will not admit so large a quantity of land as i require to be entered together if so this may possibly be evaded by making several entries to the same amount if the expense of doing which is not too heavy but this i only drop as a hint leaving the whole to your discretion and good management if the land can only be secured from others it is all i want at present the surveying i would choose to postpone at least till the spring when if you can give me any satisfactory account of this matter and of what i am next going to propose i expect to pay you a visit about the last of april the other matter just now hinted at and which i proposed in my last to join you in attempting to secure some of the most valuable lands in the kings part which i think may be accomplished after a while notwithstanding the proclamation that restrains it at present and prohibits the settling of them at all for i can never look upon that proclamation in any other light but this i say between ourselves than as a     temporary expedient to quiet the minds of the indians and must fall of course in a few years especially when those indians are consenting to our occupying the lands  any person therefore who     neglects the present opportunity of hunting out good lands and in some measure marking and distinguishing them for his own in order to keep others from settling them will never regain it therefore if you will be at the trouble of seeking out the lands i will take upon me the part of securing them so soon as there is a possibility of doing it and will moreover be at all the cost and charges of surveying and patenting c after which you shall have such a reasonable proportion of the whole as we may fix upon at our first meeting as i shall find it absolutely necessary and convenient for the better furthering of the design to let some few of my friends be concerned in the scheme and who must also partake of the advantages by this time it may be easy for you to discover that my plan is to secure a good deal of land you will consequently come in for a very handsome quantity and as you will obtain it without any costs or expenses i am in hopes you will be encouraged to begin the search in time i would choose if it were practicable to get large tracts together and it might be desirable to have them as near your settlement or fort pitt as we could get them good but not to neglect others at a greater distance if fine bodies of it lie in a place it may be a matter worthy your inquiry to find out how the maryland back line will run and what is said about laying off neales i think it is  cos grant  i will inquire particularly concerning     the ohio companys that one may know what to apprehend from them for my own part i should have no objection to a grant of land upon the ohio a good way below pittsburg but would willingly secure some good tracts nearer hand first i would recommend it to you to keep this whole matter a secret or trust it only with those in whom you can confide and who can assist you in bringing it to bear by their discoveries of land and this advice proceeds from several very good reasons and in the first place because i might be censured for the opinion i have given in respect to the kings proclamation and then if the scheme i am now proposing to you was known it might give the alarm to others and by putting them upon a plan of the same nature before we could lay a proper foundation for success ourselves set the different interests a clashing and probably in the end overturn the whole all which may be avoided by a silent management and the operation snugly carried on by you under the guise of hunting other game which you may i presume effectually do at the same time you are in pursuit of land which when fully discovered advise me of it and if there appears but a bare possibility of succeeding any time hence i will have the lands immediately surveyed to keep others off and leave the rest to time and my own assiduity to accomplish     if this letter should reach your hands before you set out i should be glad to have your thoughts fully expressed on the plan i have proposed or as soon afterwards as conveniently may be as i am desirous of knowing in time how you approve of the scheme i am c george washington    september      mt vernon john armstrong to colonel armstrong mt vernon    september      dear sir since i had the pleasure of seeing you at the warm springs i have been informed that much of the land upon yaughyaughany and monongahela which was formerly conceived to lie within the limits of virginia and on which many of our people have settled are taken into pennslyvania by the established line now running between that province and maryland and that grants may at any time be obtained from the proprietary for tracts on these waters and being informed moreover that the office from whence these rights are to issue is kept at carlyle it immediately occurred from what you were telling me of the nature of your office that i could apply to none so properly as yourself for the truth of these reports it appearing but probable that you were the very person with whom entries were made i have therefore taken the liberty sir of addressing this letter to you on the subject of these enquiries and to request the further favor of you to advise me of the mode of proceeding in order to take up ungranted land in your province what quantity of     acres will be admitted into a survey whether a person is restricted in respect to the quantity of land and number of surveys if the surveys are required to be laid in any particular form or optional in the taker up to lay them as the nature and goodness of the land and water courses may point out to him what the expence of patenting these lands amount to per thousand acres and what the annual rents are fixed at afterwards together with any other useful hints which may occur to you for my information and government as i would most willingly possess some of those lands which we have labored and toiled so hard to conquer i have desired one mr william crawford who lives upon yaughyaughany a friend of mine and i believe an acquaintance of yours as he was an officer in my regiment and in general forbes campaign to look me out a tract of about  000 acres and endeavor to secure it till he can give me advice of it i have likewise taken the liberty of saying to him that i was fully pursuaded if the land office were kept in carlyle and you had any share in the management of it that you would do me the favor of giving him any assistance in your power consistent with the rules of office and for such assistance sir after thankfully acknowledging myself your debtor would punctually reimburse you with any expence that might arise on my account so soon as i could be advised thereof i heartily wish that mrs armstrong and yourself may find all the good effects from the waters of the frederick springs that you could desire     george washington    september      mt vernon john posey to captain john posey mt vernon    september      sir having received your letter of wednesday last and to day it appears very clear to me from them as well as from some other convincing circumstances that you are not only reduced to the last shifts yourself but are determined to involve me in a great deal of perplexity and distress on your account also why else will you press so hard upon me to do more than i have already done and consented to do in waiting two years longer for my money when it is not only inconvenient but very disadvantageous also for me to do so and when i have informed you as every body else i suppose may also do that the security i have upon your lands and slaves is only answerable for the £  0 lent and interest besides when the nature of that security is considered and how much people may differ in their valuations of it it is not to be wondered at that i should be so unwilling as to risk any thing more thereon for in the first place i do not value your six acres bought of marshall with the improvements to any thing at all for reasons already known to you true it is if mr west should recover from you you may have a remedy against mr marshall but in how ample a manner is in the breast of other men to determine in the next place you rate the land bought of my brother and the improvements to near £ 00 this at best is only worth what it will fetch and if it sells for half that sum i will acknowledge myself extremely mistaken in the     last place by the estimate you sent me some time ago of your estate you value the negroes you were then possessed of to £ 00 and upwards suppose for argument sake they were worth this does not every body know that the small pox gaol fever and many other malignant disorders may sweep the greatest part of them off where then is the security and while i am mentioning this matter it is highly necessary to inquire what is become of henley jacob winney sylvia lett sarah nan and henrietta farthing negroes contained in your bill of sale to me but which i see nothing of in the estimate above mentioned thus much i have said on a supposition that i was acting as a money lender only and was looking for clear and indisputable surety but in truth the prospect of gain and advantage to myself was not the motive that led me to advance you this money twas done to serve your family and if possible to save your estate from dispersion while there remained a probability of doing it the same motive therefore and depend upon it it is a friendly one inclines me to ask what possible reason you can have for thinking that by delaying the sale of some part of your effects and taking up more money upon interest will better your fortune when you are adding to the load of debt by accumulating interest i should be glad in the next place to know if you have ever considered the consequences of borrowing the money upon the terms you say colo mason will lend it and surely you have not to stave off the dreadful hour of resigning part of your possessions into the     hands of your creditors engrosses too much of your thoughts do not understand by this that i mean to cast any reflection upon colo mason no he tells you in express terms and with candor that he is waiting for an opportunity of making a purchase which when accomplished he must have his money again giving you three or four months notice it is likely therefore that he may call for it in six months as in a longer time because the distress of the country and number of estates which are daily advertising afford great prospect of purchasing to advantage what then is to be done in this case one of these three things certainly either that colo mason must wait till he can recover his debt in a course of law by which means your own as well as the honor of your bondsman must suffer or that the security must pay the money out of his own pocket which perhaps might reduce him to the utmost distress or lastly that your negroes must be immediately exposed to sale for ready money after short notice whereas they might now be sold on credit for perhaps at least    per cent more in order to raise this sum and this probably in the midst of a crop these being things worthy of consideration i would recommend them to your serious reflection before you finally determine was the money to be had of those who prefer lending it on interest to other methods of disposing of it and you had in the first place a prospect of keeping of it for some time and in the next a moral certainty of raising the sum with the interest by the expiration of it there would then be a propriety in     your borrowing and i should feel pleasure in procuring it to you but really i cannot see that you have any one good end to answer by it on the contrary i am much misinformed if you were to get £ 00 to morrow to stop suits and demands that are already commenced if there would not be £ 00 more wanting in less than six months for the same purpose so that there appears no probability of its happily ending for as to your promising or expecting to do this and that you must give me leave to say that it is works and not words that people will judge from and where one man deceives another from time to time his word being disregarded all confidence is lost however after having endeavored to let you see in what light this matter appears to me and to set forth the evil consequences of taking money upon these terms i shall conclude with telling you that if you are absolutely determined to prefer this method to any other of procuring present relief i will become your security to colo mason for three hundred pounds on condition that you do at the same time add other things to my present security that are under no incumbrance to any person what so ever and allow me the absolute right and privilege as you yourself proposed of disposing of them for ready money to answer colo masons demand whensoever made and that some lawyer mr ellzey i would choose should draw a bill of sale or instrument of writing to this purpose without running me to any cost that may be authentick and binding but i once more caution you against a measure of   0 this kind as it may be destructive of your estate inasmuch as the money can be paid no otherwise than by an immediate sale of your effects when called for and i can see no benefit that will result from the protection it is from these reasons and a conviction that you will as unwilling then as now part from your estate that i dread the consequences of joining you in such a bond knowing that after all i have done or can do more will still be required and as little content given this makes me ardently wish that some person or other would take up my security and pay me the money that i might be entirely clear of it for i do not want to avail myself of any sort of advantages p s i have this instant been informed that you have declared you paid me all you owed me except about £ 0 does such disingenuity as this deserve any favour at my hands i think any body might readily answer for you no      diary for         january     st a fox hunting in my own neck with

finished the last cut abt one oclock this day monday part of wch was much hurt by the rust  cut down the small pieces at home  securd it note from the     most accurate experiments i coud make this year upon wheat siezd with the rust before it is fully formd  beginning to harden it appears to be a matter of very little consequence whether it is cut down so soon as it is seizd with this distemper i mean the parts of the field that are so or suffered to stand for in either case the grain perishes  has little or no flower in it that indeed wch is sufferd to stand may gain a little  but a little in respect to the grain  the other in respect to the straw so that i think it is nearly equal wch of the two methods is followed note also from this years experiments it appears certain that wheat may be cut down suffering it to take a day or two sun much sooner than it generally is i took wheat of three differt degrees of ripeness i e some whose straw and head was green but the grain of full size and milky some whose straw from the upper joint was coloring and some that the straw from the said joint was cold but the knots at ye joints green  observed after they had lain   or   days in ye sun that the grain of the first was but little shrunk the  d scarce perceptable  the last plump  full by wch it evidently appears that to cut wheat knot green is not only safe but the most desirable state it can be cut in  that where there is a large qty the question is whether it may not be better to begin while the wheat is coloring from the upper joint as the grain will lose but little if any than to cut it in an over ripe state when it may loose a good deal more by shattering for my part i am clear it is better to cut it green  shall have no reluctance to practise where the whole cannot be cut

and ward     having taken his departure for england leaves the young gentleman without any master at this time i should be glad therefore to know if it would be convenient for you to add him to the number of your pupils he is a boy of good genius about    years of age untainted in his morals and of innocent manners two years and upwards he has been reading of virgil and was at the time mr magowan left him entered upon the greek testament i presume he has grown not a little rusty in both having had no benefit of his tutor since christmas notwithstanding he left the country in march only if he comes he will have a boy well acquainted with house business which may be made as useful as possible in your family to keep him out of idleness and two horses to furnish him with the means of getting to church and elsewhere as you may permit for he will be put entirely and absolutely     under your tuition and direction to manage as you think proper in all respects now sir if you incline to take master custis i should be glad to know what conveniences it may be necessary for him to bring and how soon he may come for as to his board and schooling provender for his horses he may lay in himself i do not think it necessary to enquire into and will cheerfully pay ten or twelve pounds a year extraordinary to engage your peculiar care of and a watchful eye to him as he is a promising boy the last of his family and will possess a very large fortune add to this my anxiety to make him fit for more useful purposes than horse racer this letter will be sent to you by my brother at fredericksburg and i should be obliged to you for an answer by the first post to alexandria near to which place i live i am c p s if it is necessary for him to provide a bed could one be purchased in your neighborhood it would save a long carriage george washington   june      mt vernon to robert cary  co mt vernon   june      gentlemen my old chariot having run its race and gone through as many stages as i could conveniently make it travel is now rendered incapable of any further service the intent of this letter therefore is to desire you will bespeak me a new one   0 time enough to come out with the goods i shall hereafter write for by captn johnston or some other ship as these are kind of articles that last with care against number of years i would willingly have the chariot you may now send me made in the newest taste handsome genteel and light yet not slight and consequently unserviceable to be made of the best seasoned wood and by a celebrated workman the last importation which i have seen besides the customary steel springs have others that play in a brass barrel and contribute at one and the same time to the ease and ornament of the carriage one of this kind therefore would be my choice and green being a color little apt as i apprehend to fade and grateful to the eye i would give it the preference unless any other color more in vogue and equally lasting is entitled to precedency in that case i would be governed by fashion a light gilding on the mouldings that is round the panels and any other ornaments that may not have a heavy and tawdry look together with my arms agreeable to the impression here sent might be added by way of decoration a lining of a handsome lively colored leather of good quality i should also prefer such as green blue or c as may best suit the color of the outside let the box that slips under the seat be as large as it conveniently can be made for the benefit of storage upon a journey and to have a pole not shafts for the wheel horses to draw by together with a handsome set of harness for four middle sized     horses ordered in such a manner as to suit either two postilions without a box or a box and a postilion the box being made to fix on and take off occasionally with a hammel cloth c suitable to the lining on the harness let my crest be engraved if such a chariot as i have here described could be got at second hand little or nothing the worse for wear but at the same time a good deal under the first cost of a new one and sometimes though perhaps rarely it happens so it would be very desirable but if i am obliged to go near to the original cost i would even have one made and have been thus particular in hopes of getting a handsome chariot through your direction good taste and management—not of copper however for these do not stand the powerful heat of our sun              george washington    january      mount vernon william ramsay to william ramsay  mount vernon    january      dear sir    having once or twice of late heard yon speak highly in praise of the jersey college as if you had a desire of sending your son william there who i am told is a youth fond of study and instruction and disposed to a sedentary studious life in following of which he may not only promote his own happiness but the future welfare of others i should be glad if you have no other objection to it than what may arise from the expense if you would send him there as soon as it is convenient and depend on me for twentyfive pounds this currency a year for his support so long as it may be necessary for the completion of his education if i live to see the accomplishment of this term the sum here stipulated shall be annually paid and if i die in the mean while this letter shall be obligatory upon my heirs or executors to do it according to the true intent and meaning hereof no other return is expected or wished for this offer than that you will accept it with the same freedom and good will with which it is made and that you may not even consider it in the light of an obligation or mention it as such for be assured that from me it will never be known i am c     george washington   april      mount vernon george mason to george mason  mount vernon   april      dear sir herewith you will receive a letter and sundry papers  which were forwarded to me a day or two ago by dr ross of bladensburg i transmit them with the greater pleasure as my own desire of knowing your sentiments upon a matter of this importance exactly coincides with the doctors inclinations at a time when our lordly masters in great britain will be satisfied with nothing less than the deprivation of american freedom it seems highly necessary that something should be done to avert the stroke and maintain the liberty which we have derived from our ancestors but the manner of doing it to answer the purpose effectually is the point in question that no man should scruple or hesitate a moment to use a—ms in defence of so valuable a blessing on which all the good and evil of life depends is clearly my opinion yet a—ms i would beg leave to add should be the last resource the dernier resort addresses to the throne and remonstrances to parliament we have already it is said proved the inefficacy     of how far then their attention to our rights and privileges is to be awakened or alarmed by starving their trade and manufactures remains to be tried the northern colonies it appears are endeavoring to adopt this scheme in my opinion it is a good one and must be attended with salutary effects provided it can be carried pretty generally into execution but to what extent it is practicable to do so i will not take upon me to determine that there will be difficulties attending the execution of it every where from clashing interests and selfish designing men ever attentive to their own gain and watchful of every turn that can assist their lucrative views in preference to every other consideration cannot be denied but in the tobacco colonies where the trade is so diffused and in a manner wholly conducted by factors for their principals at home these difficulties are certainly enhanced but i think not insurmountably increased if the gentlemen in their several counties will be at some pains to explain matters to the people and stimulate them to a cordial agreement to purchase none but certain enumerated articles out of any of the stores after such a period nor import nor purchase any themselves this if it did not effectually withdraw the factors from their importations would at least make them extremely cautious in doing it as the prohibited goods could be vended to none but the nonassociators or those who would pay no regard to their association both of whom ought to be stigmatized and made the objects of public reproach the more i consider a scheme of this sort the     more ardently i wish success to it because i think there are private as well as public advantages to result from it—the former certain however precarious the other may prove for in respect to the latter i have always thought that by virtue of the same power for here alone the authority derives which assumes the right of taxation they may attempt at least to restrain our manufactories especially those of a public nature the same equity and justice prevailing in the one case as the other it being no greater hardship to forbid my manufacturing than it is to order me to buy goods of them loaded with duties for the express purpose of raising a revenue but as a measure of this sort would be an additional exertion of arbitrary power we cannot be worsted i think by putting it to the test on the other hand that the colonies are considerably indebted to great britain is a truth universally acknowledged that many families are reduced almost if not quite to penury and want from the low ebb of their fortunes and estates daily selling for the discharge of debts the public papers furnish but too many melancholy proofs of and that a scheme of this sort will contribute more effectually than any other i can devise to emerge the country from the distress it at present labors under i do most firmly believe if it can be generally adopted and i can see but one set of people the merchants excepted who will not or ought not to wish well to the scheme and that is those who live genteelly and hospitably on clear estates such as these were they     not to consider the valuable object in view and the good of others might think it hard to be curtailed in their living and enjoyments for as to the penurious man he saves his money and he saves his credit having the best plea for doing that which before perhaps he had the most violent struggles to refrain from doing the extravagant and expensive man has the same good plea to retrench his expenses he is thereby furnished with a pretext to live within bounds and embraces it prudence dictated economy to him before but his resolution was too weak to put it in practice for how can i says he who have lived in such and such a manner change my method i am ashamed to do it and besides such an alteration in the system of my living will create suspicions of the decay in my fortune and such a thought the world must not harbour i will een continue my course till at last the course discontinues the estate a sale of it being the consequence of his perseverance in error this i am satisfied is the way that many who have set out in the wrong track have reasoned till ruin stares them in the face and in respect to the poor and needy man he is only left in the same situation that he was found—better i might say because as he judges from comparison his condition is amended in proportion as it approaches nearer to those above him upon the whole therefore i think the scheme a good one and that it ought to be tried here with such alterations as the exigency of our circumstances renders absolutely necessary but how and in what     manner to begin the work is a matter worthy of consideration and whether it can be attempted with propriety or efficacy further than a communication of sentiments to one another before may when the court and assembly will meet in williamsburg and a uniform plan can be concerted and sent into the different counties to operate at the same time and in the same manner everywhere is a thing i am somewhat in doubt upon and should be glad to know your opinion of      george washington    june      mount vernon colonel bassett to colonel bassett mount vernon    june      dear sir as we have come to a resolution to set off if nothing unforeseen happens to prevent it for the warm springs about the   th of next month i do     according to promise give you notice thereof and should be glad of your company with us if you still entertain thoughts of trying the effects of those waters you will have occasion to provide nothing if i can be advised of your intentions before the wagon comes down for my necessaries so that i may provide accordingly we are all in the usual way no alteration for the better or worse in patey  the association in this and in the two neighboring counties of prince william and loudoun is compleat or near it how   0 it goes in other places i know not but hope to hear of the universality of it  we all join in tendering our love to mrs bassett yourself family and mrs dandridge and betsy george washington    august      john armstrong to colonel john armstrong fredk warm springs    august      dear sir about a fortnight ago  i came to this place with mrs washington and her daughter the latter of whom being troubled with a complaint which the efficacy of these waters it is thought might remove we resolved to try them but have found little benefit as yet from the experiment what a week or two more may do we know not and therefore are inclined to put them to the test it was with much pleasure however i heard by mr clingan that you stand in     no need of assistance from these springs which i find are applied to in all cases altho there be a moral certainty of their hurting in some many poor miserable objects are now attending here which i hope will receive the desired benefit as i dare say they are deprived of the means of obtaining any other relief from their indigent circumstances give me leave now sir to thank you for the polite and friendly assistance you gave to the affair i took the liberty in march last of recommending to your notice captn crawford from whom i have since heard informs me that your letter procured him a free and easy admission to the land office  to such indulgences as could be consistently granted consequently his work became much less difficult than otherwise it would have been  some confident reports of indian disturbances at fort pitt drove many families in from redstone and gave some alarm to the female visitors of these waters but upon a stricter scrutiny into the causes of the reports we find that misrepresentations and ill grounded fears gave rise to the whole  that our own people more than the indians are to blame for the little misunderstandings which have happened among them my best respects attend mrs armstrong in which mrs washington joins and i am c         0 george washington    april    0 mount vernon baron de botetourt to lord botetourt governor of virginia  mount vernon    april    0 my lord being fully persuaded of your excellencys inclination to render every just and reasonable service to the people you govern or to any body or society of them that shall ask it and being encouraged in a more particular manner by a letter which i have just received from mr blair clerk of the council to believe that your lordship is desirous of being fully informed how far the grant of land solicited by mr walpole and others will affect the interest of this country in general or individuals in particular i shall take the liberty being pretty intimately acquainted with the situation of the frontiers of this dominion to inform your lordship that the bounds of that grant if obtained upon the extensive plan prayed for will comprehend at least four fifths of     the land for which this government hath lately voted two thousand five hundred pounds sterling the purchase and survey of and must destroy the well grounded hopes of those if no reservation is made in their favor who have had the strongest assurances which government could give of enjoying a certain portion of the lands which have cost this country so much blood and treasure to secure by the extracts which your excellency did me the honor to enclose i perceive that the petitioners require to begin opposite to the mouth of scioto which is as least seventy or seventyfive miles below the mouth of the big kanhawa and more than three hundred from pittsburg and to extend from thence in a southwardly direction through the pass of the ouasioto mountain which by evanss map and the best accounts i have been able to get from persons who have explored that country will bring them near the latitude of north carolina from thence they go northeastwardly to the kanhawa at the junction of new river and green briar upon both of which waters we have many settlers upon lands actually patented from thence they proceed up the green briar to the head of the northeasterly branch thereof thence easterly to the allegany mountains thence along these mountains to the line of lord fairfax and thence with his line and the lines of maryland and pennsylvania till the west boundary of the latter intersects the ohio and finally down the same to the place of beginning these my lord are the bounds of a grant prayed     for and if obtained will give a fatal blow in my humble opinion to the interests of this country but these are my sentiments as a member of the community at large but i now beg leave to offer myself to your excellencys notice in a more interested point of view as an individual and as a person who considers himself in some degree the representative of the officers and soldiers who claim a right to two hundred thousand acres of this very land under a solemn act of government adopted at a very important and critical period to his majestys affairs in this part of the world and shall therefore rely on your lordships accustomed goodness and candor whilst i add a few words in support of the equity of our pretensions although in truth i have very little to say on this subject now which i have not taken the liberty of observing to your excellency before the first letter i ever did myself the honor of writing to your excellency on the subject of this land and to which i beg leave to refer contained a kind of historical account of our claim but as there requires nothing more to elucidate a right than to offer a candid exhibition of the case supported by facts i shall beg leave to refer your lordship to an order of council of the   th of february      and to governor dinwiddies proclamation which issued consequent thereupon both of which are enclosed and then add that these troops not only enlisted agreeably to the proclamation but behaved so much to the satisfaction of the country as to be honored with the most public acknowledgments of it in their legislative capacity would it not be hard then my     lord to deprive men under these circumstances or their representatives of the just reward of their toils was not this act of the governor and council offered to and accepted by the soldiery as an absolute compact between them and though the exigency of affairs or the policy of government made it necessary to continue these lands in a dormant state for some time ought not their claim to be considered when the causes cease in preference to all others we fain would hope so we flatter ourselves that in this point of view it will also appear to your lordship and that by your kind interposition and favorable representation of the case his majesty will be graciously pleased to confirm this land to us agreeably to a petition presented to your excellency in council the   th of last december with this difference only that instead of sandy creek one of the places allotted for the location of our grant and which we now certainly know will not be comprehended within the ministerial line as it is called we may be allowed to lay a part of our grant between the west boundary of pennsylvania and the river ohio which will be expressly agreeable to the words of governor dinwiddies proclamation inasmuch as it is contiguous to the fork of monongahela this favor my lord would be conferring a singular obligation on men most of whom either in their persons or fortunes have suffered in the cause of their country few of them benefited by the service and it cannot fail to receive the thanks of a grateful body of men but of none more warmly than of your lordships most obedient and humble servant     george washington  0 april    0 jonathan boucher to dr boucher  0 april    0 revd sir your favor of the  0th conveyed an unexpected piece of intelligence tho a very agreeable one—jack left this place with so many doubts  difficulties abt going to baltimore to be innoculated with the small pox that we all concluded nothing was more foreign from his intention—mrs washington having fully adopted this opinion i have withheld from her the information you gave me in respect to his undertaking  purpose if possible to keep her in total ignorance of his having been there till i hear of his return or perfect recovery as one step towds this i shoud be obliged to you to address any letter you may write me under cover to lund washington  in a hand not your own for notwithstanding it is believed jack was resolved to postpone this business yet her anxiety  uneasiness is so great that i am sure she coud not rest satisfied without knowing the contents of any letter of your writing to his family—indeed i believe was she to come to the knowledge of being at baltimore under innoculation it woud put an infallible stop to her journey to williamsburg  possibly delay mine which woud prove very injurious as my business requires that i shoud set of sic on friday the   th inst if he is in so favourable way as to permit it instead of visiting him which i should immediately do if i am informed of any dangerous or unfavorable symptoms attending his disorder for this reason i shoud be glad to hear from     him as late as can be to reach me before fryday that if all is well we may proceed without any intimation to mrs washington of this matter she having often wishd that jack woud take  go through the disorder without her knowing of it that she might escape those tortures which suspense wd throw her into little as the cause might be for them—when he is returned to annapolis you will be so good as to write me a line by post to williamsburg which shall be the first intimation of this affair i purpose to give if i can keep it concealed so long i am with very great esteem  thanks for your attention to jack on this occasion  george washington    may    0 mount vernon jonathan boucher to dr boucher mount vernon    may    0 sir your favor of the  th came to hand last night but i do not think myself prepared at this time to give any conclusive answer to the question you propounded respecting mr custiss travelling to perfect his education it is a matter of very great consequence and well deserving of the most serious consideration especially by one who stands in the degree of affinity to him that i do a natural parent has only two things principally to consider the improvement of his son and the finances to do it with if he fails in the first     not through his own neglect he laments it as a misfortune if exceeded in the second he endeavors to correct it as an abuse unaccountable to any and regardless of what the world may say who do not cannot suspect him of acting upon any other motive than the good of the party he is to satisfy himself only but this is not the case with respect to guardians they are not only to be actuated by the same motives which govern in the other case but are to consider in what light their conduct may be viewed by those whom the constitution hath placed as a controulling power over them because a faupas committed by them often incurs the severest censure and sometimes punishment when the intention may be strictly laudable thus much sir i have taken the liberty of saying to shew you in what light i consider myself generally as the guardian of this youth but before i could adopt the measure finally upon the extensive plan you seem to propose and give a definitive answer it would be incumbent on me as the person who is to account for his worldly concerns as well as personal accomplishments to have some regular system proposed that it may be seen at one view how the expence and his income are proportioned to each other for tho i am far very far from harboring any distrust of your being influenced by any similar views or that you would be unreasonable in your expectations as his governor yet some plan should be pointed out some estimate formed by which i am to be guided otherwise were i hastily to determine that a     year or two hence or as his education and judgment ripened he was to travel and when that period arrived it was found to be upon a plan too enlarged for his fortune and a stop thereby put to it it might be a disappointment to you which i should be sorry for as i make it a point at least endeavor to do so not to deceive any one from what i have said you may possibly conceive that i am averse to his travelling for the completion of his education but be assured sir i am not there is nothing in my opinion more desirable to form the manners and encrease the knowledge of observant youth than such a plan as you have sketched out and i beg of you to believe that there is no gentleman under whose care mrs washington and myself would so soon entrust mr custis as yourself after he is sufficiently instructed in classical knowledge here it may be depended on therefore that the gratification of this passion in him will never meet with any interruption from me and i think i may venture to add from his mother provided he is disposed to set out upon such a plan of improvement as your good sense is capable of dictating to him and provided also that you will undertake to accompany and guide him in the pursuit of it add to this that he will be content with such an allowance as his income can afford for here it is also necessary to observe that tho he is possessed of what is called a good estate it is not a profitable one his lands are poor consequently the crops short and tho he has a number of slaves slaves in such cases only add to   0 the expence about  0 and from that to  0 hogsheads of tobacco is as much as he generally makes of a year and if this is cleared it is as much as can be expected considering the number of people he has to cloath and the many incident charges attending such an estate this sir is all the answer i am capable of giving you at present if you will do me the favor to be more explicit on this subject in another letter i will not only think of the matter with the best attention to it i am master of but advise with some of his and my friends whilst i am in williamsburg as a justification of my conduct therein and as to his being innoculated for the small pox previous to such an event the propriety of it is so striking that it cannot admit of a doubt in truth my opinion of this is that it ought to happen whether he travels or not as this disorder will in the course of a few years be scarce ever out of his own country the session of the burgesses in

which i brought from williamsburg which place i left on saturday in the afternoon the assembly was not then up a few bills remained unfinished which would oblige the house to sit again this week little business of a public nature has been transacted private bills have engrossed the time of the house almost wholely since the first meeting of it a new association is formed much upon the old plan but more relaxed to which the merchants then in town acceded committees in each county are to     be chosen to attend to the importations and see if our agreements cannot be more strictly adhered to there was nothing new when i left williamsburg yours and mrs fairfaxs friends were well as i suppose your letters advise i had many compliments to you all colonel fairfax included which as i am but a poor hand at delivering specially i must beg the favor of having them received in a lump i am very much obliged to you for the favor of getting stone from your quarries i understand it has assisted me much as it is got at much easier than with me my compliments in which mrs washington c joins are tendered and i should be glad to know how you all do after a little rest and enquiry into the state of my business i will do myself the pleasure of seeing you at belvoir and paying my respects to sir thomas i am c  george washington july  0th    0 mount vernon jonathan boucher to dr boucher mount vernon july  0th    0 dr sir the books you wrote for i hope you will receive in good order by joe as i desired lund washington to pack them up carefully  see them put into the portmanteau no thread came from mr addisons nor any from mr digges to which place i sent thinking it might be arrived there along with jacks     keys we could easily have carried down  most certainly should have done so if it had ever got this length that there shoud be a dissatisfaction  murmuring at the virginia association by those who are more strictly bound i do not much wonder at but it was the best that the friends to the cause coud obtain here  tho too much relaxed from the spirit with which a measure of this sort ought to be conducted yet will be attended with better effects i expect than the last inasmuch as it will become general  adopted by the trade upon the whole i think the people of virgina have too large latitude  wish that the inhabitants of the north may not have too little what i woud be understood by it is that their public virtue may not be put to too severe a tryal to stand the test much longer if their importations are not equal to the real necessities of the people whether it is or is not i cannot undertake to judge but suppose they are not by the defection of new york  attempts tho unsuccessful as yet in other places to admit a general importation of goods tea only excepted —as soon as you are able to get the samples from mr johnson mrs washington will be much obliged in having joe sent with them we set out     this day for fredericksburg i expect to be

lately sold to walpole and others for a certain tract of country on the ohio the distance from pritchards to cresaps according to computation is twentysix miles thus reckoned to the fort at henry

twelve oclock distance    miles in the afternoon doctor craik my servant much amended and the baggage arrived from pritchards said to be    miles  0th—having purchased two horses and recovered another which had been gone from me near three years i despatched my boy giles with my two ridinghorses home and proceeded on my journey arriving at one wises now turners mill about twentytwo miles it being reckoned seven to the place where coxs fort formerly stood ten to one parkers and five afterwards the road from the south branch of pattersons creek is hilly down the creek on which is good land sloping to parkers and from parkers to turners hilly again   th—the morning being wet and heavy we did not set off till eleven oclock and arrived that night at one killams on a branch of georges creek distant ten and a half measured miles from the north branch of the potomac where we crossed at the lower end of my deceased brother augustines bottom known by the name of pendergrasss this crossing is two miles from the aforesaid mill and the road bad as it likewise is to killams the country being very hilly and stony from killams to fort cumberland is the same distance that it is to the crossing above mentioned and the road from thence to jolliffs by the old town much better   th—we left killams early in the morning breakfasted at the little meadows ten miles off and lodged at the great crossings     twenty miles further which we found a tolerable good days work the country we travelled over today was very mountainous and stony with but very little good land and that lying in spots   th—set out about sunrise breakfasted at the great meadows  thirteen miles and reached captain crawfords  about five oclock the lands we travelled over today till we had crossed the lawrel hill except in small spots was very mountainous and indifferent but when we came down the hill to the plantation of mr thos gist the land appeared charming that which lay level being as rich and black as any thing could possibly be the more hilly kind tho of a different complexion must be good as well from the crops it produces as from the beautiful white oaks that grow thereon tho white oak in general indicates poor land yet this does not appear to be of that cold kind the land from gists to crawfords is very broken tho not mountainous in spots exceeding rich and in general free from stone

river the coal seemed to be of the very best kind burning freely and abundance of it   th—went to view some land which captain crawford had taken up for me near the youghiogany distant about twelve miles this tract which contains about one thousand six hundred acres includes some as fine land as ever i saw and a great deal of rich meadow and in general is leveller than the country about it this tract is well watered and has a valuable millseat except that the stream is rather too slight and it is said not constant more than seven or eight months in the year but on account of the fall and other conveniences no place can exceed it in going to this land i passed through two other tracts which captain crawford had taken up for my brothers samuel and john that     belonging to the former was not so rich as some i had seen but very valuable on account of its levelness and little stone—the soil and timber being good that of the latter had some bottom land upon  that was very good tho narrow—the hills very rich but the land in general broken i intended to have visited the land which crawford had procured for lund washington this day also but time falling short i was obliged to postpone it night came on before i got back to crawfords where i found colonel stephen the lands which i passed over today were generally hilly and the growth chiefly whiteoak but very good notwithstanding and what is extraordinary and contrary to the property of all other lands i ever saw before the hills are the richest land the soil upon the sides and summits of them being as black as a coal and the growth walnut cherry pine  bushes c the flats are not so rich and a good deal more mixed with stone   th—at captain crawfords till the evening when i went to mr john stephensons  on my way to pittsburg and lodged this day was visited by one mr ennis who had travelled down the little kenhawa almost from the head to the mouth on which he says the lands are broken the bottoms neither very wide nor rich but covered with beach at the mouth the lands are good and continue so up the river and about wheeling and fishing creek is according to his account a body of fine land i also saw a son of captain john hardens who said he had been from the mouth of the little kenhawa to the big but his description of the lands seemed to be so vague and indeterminate that it was much doubted whether he ever was there or not he says however that at the mouth of the big kenhawa there may be about  0 or   000 acres of land had in a body that is good that you are not above   or   miles to the hills and that the falls of the kenhawa are not above  0 miles up it   th—dr craik and myself with captain crawford and others arrived at fort pitt distant from the crossing fortythree and a half measured miles  in riding this distance we passed   0 over a great deal of exceedingly fine land chiefly whiteoak especially from seveigleys creek to turtle creek but the whole broken resembling as i think all the lands in this country do the loudoun lands for hills we lodged in what is called the town distant about three hundred yards from the fort at one mr semples who keeps a very good house of public entertainment these houses which are built of logs and ranged into streets are on the monongahela and i suppose may be about twenty in number and inhabited by indian traders c the fort is built on the point between the rivers allegany and monongahela but not so near the pitch of it as fort duquesne stood it is fivesided and regular two of which next the land are of brick the others stockade a moat encompasses it the garrison consists of two companies of royal irish commanded by captain edmonson   th—dined in the fort with colonel croghan and the officers of the garrison supped there also meeting with great civility from the gentlemen and engaged to dine with colonel croghan the next day at his seat about four miles up the allegany   th—received a message from colonel croghan that the white mingo and other chiefs of the six nations had something to say to me and desiring that i should be at his house about eleven where they were to meet i went up and received a speech with a string of wampum from the white mingo to the following effect that i was a person whom some of them remember to have seen when i was sent on an embassy to the french and most of them had heard of they were come to bid me welcome to this country and to desire that the people of virginia would consider them as friends and brothers linked together in one chain that i would inform the governor that it was their wish to live in peace and harmony with the white people and that though there had been some unhappy differences between them and the people upon our frontiers they were all made up and they hoped forgotten and concluded with saying that their brothers of virginia did not come among them and trade as the inhabitants of the other provinces did from whence they were afraid that we did not look upon them with so friendly an eye as they could wish     to this i answered after thanking them for their friendly welcome that all the injuries and affronts that had passed on either side were now totally forgotten and that i was sure nothing was more wished and desired by the people of virginia than to live in the strictest friendship with them that the virginians were a people not so much engaged in trade as the pennsylvanians ca which was the reason of their not being so frequently among them but that it was possible they might for the time to come have stricter connexions with them and that i would acquaint the governor with their desires after dinner at colonel croghans we returned to pittsburg colonel croghan with us who intended to accompany us part of the way down the river having engaged an indian called the pheasant and one joseph nicholson an interpreter to attend us the whole voyage also a young indian warrior  0th—we embarked in a large canoe  with sufficient store of provisions and necessaries and the following persons besides dr craik and myself to wit—captain crawford joseph nicholson robert bell william harrison charles morgan and daniel rendon a boy of captain crawfords and the indians who were in a canoe by themselves from fort pitt we sent our horses and boys back to captain crawfords with orders to meet us there again the   th day of november colonel croghan lieutenant hamilton and mr magee set out with us at two we dined at mr magees and encamped ten miles below and four above the logstown we passed several large islands which appeared to be very good as the bottoms also did on each side of the river alternately the hills on one side being opposite to the bottoms on the other which seem generally to be about three or four hundred yards wide and so vice versa   st—left our encampment about six oclock and breakfasted at the logstown where we parted with colonel croghan and company about nine oclock at eleven we came to the mouth of the big beaver creek opposite to which is a good situation for a house and above it on the same side that is the west there appears to be a body of fine land about five miles lower     down on the east side comes in raccoon creek at the mouth of which and up it appears to be a body of good land also all the land between this creek and the monongahela and for fifteen miles back is claimed by colonel croghan under a purchase from the indians and which sale he says is confirmed by his majesty on this creek where the branches thereof interlock with the waters of shirtees creek there is according to colonel croghans account a body of fine rich level land this tract he wants to sell and offers it at five pounds sterling per hundred acres with an exemption of quitrents for twenty years after which to be subject to the payment of four shillings and two pence sterling per hundred provided he can sell it in tenthousandacre lots note the unsettled state of this country renders any purchase dangerous from raccoon creek to little beaver creek appears to me to be little short of ten miles and about three miles below this we encamped after hiding a barrel of biscuit in an island in sight to lighten our canoe   d—as it began to snow about midnight and continued pretty steadily at it it was about half after seven before we left our encampment at the distance of about eight miles we came to the mouth of yellow creek to the west opposite to or rather below which appears to be a long bottom of very good land and the ascent to the hills apparently gradual there is another pretty large bottom of very good land about two or three miles above this about eleven or twelve miles from this and just above what is called the long island which though so distinguished is not very remarkable for length breadth or goodness comes in on the east side the river a small creek or run the name of which i could not learn and a mile or two below the island on the west side comes in big stony creek not larger in appearance than the other on neither of which does there seem to be any large bottoms or bodies of good land about seven miles from the last mentioned creek twentyeight from our last encampment and about seventyfive from pittsburg we came to the mingo town situate on the west side the river a little above the cross creeks this place contains about twenty cabins and seventy inhabitants of the six nations had we set off early and kept constantly at it we might have reached lower     than this place today as the water in many places run pretty swift in general more so than yesterday the river from fort pitt to the logstown has some ugly rifts and shoals which we found somewhat difficult to pass whether from our inexperience of the channel or not i cannot undertake to say from the logstown to the mouth of little beaver creek is much the same kind of water that is rapid in some places gliding gently along in others and quite still in many the water from little beaver creek to the mingo town in general is swifter than we found it the preceding day and without any shallows there being some one part or another always deep which is a natural consequence as the river in all the distance from fort pitt to this town has not widened at all nor doth the bottoms appear to be any larger the hills which come close to the river opposite to each bottom are steep and on the side in view in many places rocky and cragged but said to abound in good land on the tops these are not a range of hills but broken and cut in two as if there were frequent watercourses running through which however we did not perceive to be the case consequently they must be small if any the river along down abounds in wild geese and several kinds of ducks but in no great quantity we killed five wild turkeys today upon our arrival at the mingo town we received the disagreeable news of two traders being killed at a town called the grapevine town thirtyeight miles below this which caused us to hesitate whether we should proceed or wait for further intelligence   d—several imperfect accounts coming in agreeing that only one person was killed and the indians not supposing it to be done by their people we resolved to pursue our passage till we could get some more distinct account of this transaction accordingly about two oclock we set out with the two indians who were to accompany us in our canoe and in about four miles came to the mouth of a creek called sculp creek on the east side at the mouth of which is a bottom of very good land as i am told there likewise is up it the cross creeks as they are called are not large that on the west side is biggest at the mingo town we found and left sixty  odd warriors of the six nations going to the cherokee country to proceed to war against the catawbas about     ten miles below the town we came to two other cross creeks that on the west side largest but not big and called by nicholson french creek about three miles or a little better below this at the lower point of some islands which stand contiguous to each other we were told by the indians with us that three men from virginia by virginians they mean all the people settled upon redstone c had marked the land from hence all the way to redstone that there was a body of exceeding fine land lying about this place and up opposite to the mingo town as also down to the mouth of fishing creek at this place we encamped   th—we left our encampment before sunrise and about six miles below it we came to the mouth of a pretty smart creek coming in to the eastward called by the indians splitisland creek from its running in against an island on this creek there is the appearance of good land a distance up it six miles below this again we came to another creek on the west side called by nicholson wheeling and about a mile lower down appears to be another small water coming in on the east side which i remark because of the scarcity of them and to show how badly furnished this country is with millseats two or three miles below this again is another run on the west side up which is a near way by land to the mingo town and about four miles lower comes in another on the east at which place is a path leading to the settlement at redstone about a mile and a half below this again comes in the pipe creek so called by the indians from a stone which is found here out of which they make pipes opposite to this that is on the east side is a bottom of exceeding rich land but as it seems to lie low i am apprehensive that it is subject to be overflowed this bottom ends where the effects of a hurricane appear by the destruction and havoc among the trees two or three miles below the pipe creek is a pretty large creek on the west side called by nicholson foxgrapevine by others captema creek on which eight miles up is the town called the grapevine town and at the mouth of it is the place where it was said the traders lived and the one was killed to this place we came about three oclock in the afternoon and finding nobody there we agreed to camp     that nicholson and one of the indians might go up to the town and inquire into the truth of the report concerning the murder    th—about seven oclock nicholson and the indian returned they found nobody at the town but two old indian women the men being a hunting from these they learnt that the trader was not killed but drowned in attempting to ford the ohio and that only one boy belonging to the traders was in these parts the trader father to him being gone for horses to take home their skins about half an hour after seven we set out from our encampment around which and up the creek is a body of fine land in our passage down to this we see innumerable quantities of turkeys and many deer watering and browsing on the shoreside some of which we killed neither yesterday nor the day before did we pass any rifts or very rapid water the river gliding gently along nor did we perceive any alteration in the general face of the country except that the bottoms seemed to be getting a little longer and wider as the bends of the river grew larger about five miles from the vine creek comes in a very large creek to the eastward called by the indians cut creek from a town or tribe of indians which they say was cut off entirely in a very bloody battle between them and the six nations this creek empties just at the lower end of an island and is seventy or eighty yards wide and i fancy it is the creek commonly called by the people of redstone c wheeling it extends according to the indians account a great way and interlocks with the branches of splitisland creek abounding in very fine bottoms and exceeding good land just below this on the west side comes in a small run and about five miles below it on the west side also another middling large creek empties called by the indians brokentimber creek so named from the timber that is destroyed on it by a hurricane on the head of this was a town of the delawares which is now left two miles lower down on the same side is another creek smaller than the last and bearing according to the indians the same name opposite to these two creeks on     the east side appears to be a large bottom of good land about two miles below the last mentioned creek on the east side and at the end of the bottom aforementioned comes in a small creek or large run seven miles from this comes in muddy creek on the east side of the river a pretty large creek and heads up against and with some of the waters of monongahela according to the indians account and contains some bottoms of very good land but in general the hills are steep and country broken about it at the mouth of this creek is the largest flat i have seen upon the river the bottom extending two or three miles up the river above it and a mile below tho it does not seem to be of the richest kind and yet is exceeding good upon the whole if it be not too low and subject to freshets about half way in the long reach we encamped opposite to the beginning of a bottom on the east side of the river at this place we threw out some lines at night and found a catfish of the size of our largest river cats hooked to it in the morning though it was of the smallest kind here we found no rifts in this days passage but pretty swift water in some places and still in others we found the bottoms increased in size both as to length and breadth and the river more choked up with fallen trees and the bottom of the river next the shores rather more muddy but in general stony as it has been all the way down   th—left our encampment at half an hour after six oclock and passed a small run on the west side about four miles lower at the lower end of the long reach and for some distance up it on the east side is a large bottom but low and covered with beech near the rivershore which is no indication of good land the long reach is a straight course of the river for about eighteen or twenty miles which appears the more extraordinary as the ohio in general is remarkably crooked there are several islands in this reach some containing an hundred or more acres of land but all i apprehend liable to be overflowed at the end of this reach we found one martin and lindsay two traders and from them learnt that the person drowned was one philips attempting in company with rogers another indian trader to swim the river with their horses at an improper place rogers himself narrowly escaping five miles lower down comes     in a large creek from the east right against an island of good land at least a mile or two in length at the mouth of this creek the name of which i could not learn except that it was called by some bulls creek from one bull that hunted on it is a bottom of good land though rather too much mixed with beech opposite to this island the indians showed us a buffalos path the tracks of which we see five or six miles below the last mentioned creek we came to the three islands before which we observed a small run on each side coming in below these islands is a large body of flat land with a watercourse running through it on the east side and the hills back neither so high nor steep in appearance as they are up the river on the other hand the bottoms do not appear so rich though much longer and wider the bottom last mentioned is upon a straight reach of the river i suppose six or eight miles in length at the lower end of which on the east side comes in a pretty large run from the size of the mouth about this above below and back there seems to be a very large body of flat land with some little risings in it about twelve miles below the three islands we encamped just above the mouth of a creek which appears pretty large at the mouth and just above an island all the lands from a little below the creek which i have distinguished by the name of bull creek appear to be level with some small hillocks intermixed as far as we could see into the country we met with no rifts today but some pretty strong water upon the whole tolerable gentle the sides of the river were a good deal incommoded with old trees which impeded our passage a little this day proved clear and pleasant the only day since the   th that it did not rain or snow or threaten the one or other   th—left our encampment a quarter before seven and after passing the creek near which we lay and another much the same size and on the same side west also an island about two miles in length but not wide we came to the mouth of muskingum distant from our encampment about four miles this river is about one hundred and fifty yards wide at the mouth it runs out in a gentle current and clear stream and is navigable a great way into the country for canoes from muskingum to the little kanhawa is about thirteen miles this is about as wide at     the mouth as the muskingum but the water much deeper it runs up towards the inhabitants of monongahela and according to the indians account forks about forty or fifty miles up it and the ridge between the two prongs leads directly to the settlement to this fork and above the water is navigable for canoes on the upper side of this river there appears to be a bottom of exceeding rich land and the country from hence quite up to the three islands level and in appearance fine the ohio running round it in the nature of a horseshoe forms a neck of flat land which added to that running up the second long reach aforementioned cannot contain less than fifty thousand acres in view about six or seven miles below the mouth of the little kenhawa we came to a small creek on the west side which the indians called little hockhocking but before we did this we passed another small creek on the same side near the mouth of that river and a cluster of islands afterwards the lands for two or three miles below the mouth of the kenhawa on both sides of the ohio appear broken and indifferent but opposite to the little hockhocking there is a bottom of exceeding good land through which there runs a small watercourse i suppose there may be of this bottom and flat land together two or three thousand acres the lower end of this bottom is opposite to a small island which i dare say little of it is to be seen when the river is high about eight miles below little hockhocking we encamped opposite to the mouth of the great hockhocking which tho so called is not a large water though the indians say canoes can go up it forty or fifty miles since we left the little kenhawa the lands appear neither so level nor so good the bends of the river and bottoms are longer indeed but not so rich as in the upper part of the river   th—left our encampment about seven oclock two miles below a small run comes in on the east side through a piece of land that has a very good appearance the bottom beginning above our encampment and continuing in appearance wide for four miles down to a place where there comes in a small run and to the hills where we found kiashuta and his hunting party encamped here we were under a necessity of paying our compliments as this person was one of the six nation chiefs and the     head of them upon this river in the person of kiashuta i found an old acquaintance he being one of the indians that went to the french in      he expressed a satisfaction at seeing me and treated us with great kindness giving us a quarter of very fine buffalo he insisted upon our spending that night with him and in order to retard us as little as possible moves his camp down the river about   miles just below the mouth of the creek the name of which i could not learn it not being large at this place we all encamped after much counselling the over night they all came to my fire the next morning with great formality when kiashuta rehearsing what had passed between me and the sachems at colonel croghans thanked me for saying that peace and friendship were the wish of the people of virginia with them and for recommending it to the traders to deal with them upon a fair and equitable footing and then again expressed their desire of having a trade opened with virginia and that the governor thereof might not only be made acquainted therewith but of their friendly disposition towards the white people this i promised to do   th—the tedious ceremony which the indians observe in their counsellings and speeches detained us till nine oclock opposite to the creek just below which we encamped is a pretty long bottom and i believe tolerably wide but about eight or nine miles below the aforementioned creek and just below a pavement of rocks on the west side comes in a creek with fallen timber at the mouth on which the indians say there are wide bottoms and good land the river bottoms above for some distance are very good and continue for near half a mile below the creek the pavement of rocks is only to be seen at low water about a mile or a little better below the mouth of the creek there is another pavement of rocks on the east side in a kind of sedgy ground on this creek many buffaloes are according to the indians account six miles below this comes in a small creek on the west side at the end of a small naked island and just above another pavement of rocks this creek comes thro a bottom of fine land and opposite to it on the east side of the river appears to be a large bottom of very fine land also at this place begins what they call the great bend five miles below  00 this again on the east side comes in about  00 yards above a little stream or gut another creek which is just below an island on the upper point of which are some dead standing trees and a parcel of whitebodied sycamores in the mouth of this creek lies a sycamore blown down by the wind from hence an east line may be run three or four miles thence a north line till it strikes the river which i apprehend would include about three or four thousand acres of exceeding valuable land at the mouth of this creek which is three or four miles above two islands at the lower end of the last is a rapid and the point of the bend is the warriors path to the cherokee country for two miles and a half below this the ohio runs a northeast course and finishes what they call the great bend two miles and a half below this we encamped  0th—we set out at fifty minutes past seven the weather being windy and cloudy after a night of rain in about two miles we came to the head of a bottom in the shape of a horseshoe which i judge to be about six miles round the beginning of the bottom appeared to be very good land but the lower part from the growth did not seem so friendly an east course from the lower end would strike the river again about the beginning of the bottom the upper part of the bottom we encamped on was an exceeding good one but the lower part rather thin land and covered with beech in it are some clear meadowland and a pond or lake this bottom begins just below the rapid at the point of the great bend from whence a n n w course would answer to run a parallel to the next turn of the river the river from this place narrows very considerably and for five or six miles or more is scarcely more than one hundred and fifty or two hundred yards over the water yesterday except the rapid at the great bend and some swift places about the islands was quite dead and as easily passed one way as the other the land in general appeared level and good about ten miles below our encampment and a little lower down than the bottom described to lie in the shape of a horseshoe comes in a small creek on the west side and opposite to this on the east begins a body of flat land which the indians tell us runs quite across the fork to the falls in the kenhawa and  0  must at least be three days walk across if so the flat land contained therein must be very considerable a mile or two below this we landed and after getting a little distance from the river we came without any rising to a pretty lively kind of land grown up with hickory and oaks of different kinds intermixed with walnut c we also found many shallow ponds the sides of which abounding with grass invited innumerable quantities of wild fowl among which i saw a couple of birds in size between a swan and a goose and in color somewhat between the two being darker than the young swan and of a more sooty color the cry of these was as unusual as the bird itself i never heard any noise resembling it before about five miles below this we encamped in a bottom of good land which holds tolerably flat and rich for some distance out    st—i sent the canoe along down to the junction of the two rivers about five miles that is the kenhawa with the ohio and set out upon a hunting party to view the land we steered nearly east for about eight or nine miles then bore southwardly and westwardly till we came to our camp at the confluence of the rivers the land from the rivers appeared but indifferent and very broken whether these ridges may not be those that divide the waters of the ohio from the kenhawa is not certain but i believe they are if so the lands may yet be good if not that which lies off the river bottoms is good for little november  st—a little before eight oclock we set off with our canoe up the river to discover what kinds of lands lay upon the kenhawa the land on both sides this river just at the mouth is very fine but on the east side when you get towards the hills which i judge to be about six or seven hundred yards from the river it appears to be wet and better adapted for meadow than tillage this bottom continues up the east side for about two miles and by going up the ohio a good tract might be got of bottom land including the old shawnee town which is about three miles up the ohio just above the mouth of a creek where the aforementioned bottom ends on the east side the kenhawa which extends up it at least fifty miles by the indians  0  account and of great width to be ascertained as we come down in many places very rich in others somewhat wet and pondy fit for meadow but upon the whole exceeding valuable as the land after you get out of the rich bottom is very good for grain tho not rich we judged we went up this river about ten miles today on the east side appear to be the same good bottoms but small neither long nor wide and the hills back of them rather steep and poor  d—we proceeded up the river with the canoe about four miles farther and then encamped and went a hunting killed five buffaloes and wounded some others three deer c this country abounds in buffaloes and wild game of all kinds as also in all kinds of wild fowl there being in the bottoms a great many small grassy ponds or lakes which are full of swans geese and ducks of different kinds some of our people went up the river four or five miles higher and found the same kind of bottom on the west side and we were told by the indians that it continued to the falls which they judged to be fifty or sixty miles higher up this bottom next the water in most places is very rich as you approach the hills you come in many to a thin whiteoak land and poor the hills so far as we could judge were from half a mile to a mile from the river poor and steep in the parts we saw with pine growing on them whether they are generally so or not we cannot tell but i fear they are  d—we set off down the river on our return homewards and encamped at the mouth at the beginning of the bottom above the junction of the rivers and at the mouth of a branch on the east side i marked two maples an elm and hoopwood tree as a corner of the soldiers land if we can get it intending to take all the bottom from hence to the rapids in the great bend into one survey i also marked at the mouth of another gut lower down on the west side at the lower end of the long bottom an ash and hoopwood for the beginning of another of the soldiers surveys to extend up so as to include all the bottom in a body on the west side in coming from our last encampment up the kenhawa i endeavored to take the courses and distances of the river by a pocket compass and guessing which i make thus n by w   miles n n w  ½ miles

then ends after passing these hills which may run on the river near a mile there appears to be another pretty good bottom on the east side at this place we met a canoe going to the illinois with sheep and at this place also that is at the end of the bottom from the kenhawa just as we came to the hills we met with a sycamore about sixty yards from the river of a most extraordinary size it measuring three feet from the ground fortyfive feet round lacking two inches and not fifty yards from it was another thirtyone feet   inches round three feet from the ground also the second bottom hinted at the other side that is the one lying above the bottom that reaches from the kanhawa is that taken notice of the  0th ulto to lie in the shape of a horse shoe and must from its situation and quantity of level land be very valuable if the land is but tolerably good after passing this bottom and about a mile of hills we entered into a third bottom and encamped this bottom reaches within about half a mile of the rapid at the point of the great bend  th—i sent off the canoe with our baggage and walked across the neck on foot with captain crawford the distance according to our walking about eight miles as we kept a straight course under the foot of the hills which run about southeast and were two hours and a half walking of it this is a good neck of land the soil being generally good and in places very rich there is a large proportion of meadow ground and the land as high dry and level as one could wish the growth in most places is beech intermixed with walnut c but more especially with poplar of which there are numbers very large the land towards the  0  upper end is blackoak and very good upon the whole a valuable tract might be had here and i judge the quantity to be about four thousand acres after passing this bottom and the rapid as also some hills which jut pretty close to the river we came to that bottom before remarked the   th ultimo which being well described there needs no further remark except that the bottom within view appears to be exceeding rich but as i was not out upon it i cannot tell how it is back from the river a little above this bottom we encamped the afternoon being rainy and night wet  th—we left our encampment a little after daylight and in about five miles we came to kiashutas hunting camp which was now removed to the mouth of that creek noted october   th for having fallen timber at the mouth of it in a bottom of good land between the bottom last described and this bottom there is nothing but hills on the east side except a little flat of  00 acres or so between this bottom thro which the creek comes may be about four or five miles in length and tolerably wide grown up pretty much with beech tho the soil is good by the kindness and idle ceremony of the indians i was detained at kiashutas camp all the remaining part of this day and having a good deal of conversation with him on the subject of land he informed me that it was further from the mouth of the great kenhawa to the fall of that river than it was between the two kenhawas that the bottom on the west side which begins near the mouth of the kenhawa continues all the way to the falls without the interposition of hills and widens as it goes especially from a pretty large creek that comes in about ten or fifteen miles higher up than where we were that in the fork there is a body of good land and at some pretty considerable distance above this the river forks again at an island and there begins the reed or cane to grow that the bottoms on the east side of the river are also very good but broken with hills and that the river is easily passed with canoes to the falls which cannot be less than one hundred miles but further it is not possible to go with them and that there is but one ridge from thence to the settlements upon the river above that it is possible for a man to travel the country between being so much broken with steep hills and precipices  0  he further informed which seemed to be corroborated by all with whom i conversed that the back of the short broken hills but down upon the rivers are very uneven and not rich except the lands upon creeks till you come towards the heads of the creeks then the land grows leveller and the soil richer wednesday  th—we set out at half an hour after seven and ing the bottom through which the creek with the fallen timber at the mouth runs and which i believe is called buffalo creek we came to a range of hills for a mile or more in length upon the river east side then comes in the bottom opposite to which the creek below which we lodged at with the indians the   th ulto empties this also appears to be a bottom of four or five miles in length and tolerable good from the river when we pass this bottom the hills rather smaller and flatter than usual come close to the river east side for four or five miles then begins another bottom above or opposite to a small island but before we came to this mile or two we passed a good smart bottom on the east side this bottom lies opposite to great hockocking   above which and opposite to dela hunting party we encamped thursday  th—we left our encampment as soon as we could clearly distinguish the rocks and after passing the bottom which neither appeared to be long wide nor very we came to a second noticed the bottom   th ulto opposite to a creek on the west side called by the indians little hockhocking but may easily be distinguished by having a large stone just at its mouth the upper side and appears to be very wide and good and must be very valuable if it is not liable to be overflowed some parts of it appearing low the lower part of this bottom as was observed the   th ulto is opposite to a small and barren island with only a few bushes upon it the upper part of it begins at much such another place as side and part of a pretty long and at a drain or small run that comes out of the hills this is within a mile or two of the mouth of the kenhawa and the next bottom except a little narrow slip at the foot of the hills below the at the mouth of the kenhawa captain crawford one of the indians and myself left the canoe intending to meet  0  it again at the mouth of muskingum about thirteen miles above but the indian by mistake brought us to the river miles below it in this excursion we passed over various kinds of land some tolerable good whiteoak ground level and meadowy some very hilly and broken with stone and some black oak thinly timbered but good for farming and others about miles before we came to the river which was at a place where there was no bottom exceeding good full level enough and well timbered with and black oak but in all the ground we passed over this day and i suppose we could not have walked less than miles there was no water this was part of the land where i thought on octo     0000 acres might be got but it does not answer my expectations however by falling the river too low i apprehend the worst of it as we were the ridges that divide the waters of ohio from the kenhawa and up towards the   islands has appearance just below the mouth of the muskingum we encamped friday  th—the night proving very rainy and morning wet we did not set out till half after ten oclock and encamped by the   islands seeing a bear upon the shore we landed and followed it about half a mile from the river which gave us an opportunity of seeing a little of the land which was very hilly but rich saturday  0th after a night of incessant thunder and lightning attended with heavy and constant rain till    oclock in the day we set off about twelve oclock the rain then ceasing and to the lower end of the long reach distant about    miles a little stream imperceptible to the view in our passage down now pouring in her mite the river rising very fast and grown so muddy as to render the water irksome to drink sunday   th—the last night proved a night of incessant rain attended with thunder and lightning the river by this morning had raised about feet and was swelling fast the rain seeming to abate a little and the wind springing up in our favor we were tempted to set off but we were deceived in both for the wind soon ceased and the rain continued without intermission till about four oclock when it moderated however tho we did not set off till eleven we got to the head of the long reach abt    miles the river continuing to rise fast and much choaked with wood  0  monday   th—there fell a little rain in the night tho nothing to speak of about sunrise we left our encampment to encounter a very stream which by this time had risen feet perpendicular and running with great velocity after contending with it the whole day we were not able to get more than about five miles the water still rising and the current if possible running with more violence we came to a resolution of ordering our horses which by appointment were to be at burg the   th inst to meet us at mingo town accordingly tuesday   th—we despached a young indian express to valentine crawford who had the charge of them to proceed on to that place where we purposed if possible to get the canoe being about  0 miles below in pursuance of this resolution we imbarked again and with difficulty got about   miles further to the mouth of the uppermost broken timber creek in course of last night the river rose perpendicular and in the with what it rose in the day time must be now four or five and twenty feet above its usual height and not a great deal below its banks—in low places above them this day about   in the afternoon we met two battoes and a large canoe going at a very fast rate to the illinois with provisions for the garrison at fort chartres wednesday   th—the river began to come at a stand between sunset and dark night and continued for some hours so falling only two feet by sun rise about an hour by sun we left our encampment and reached a little above the captening or fox grape wine creek about eleven miles not finding the water quite so strong as yesterday with a little assistance from the wind about two or three miles below captening i got out on the west side passed through a neck of as good lands as ever i saw between that and the creek the land on the hillsides was as rich as the bottoms than which nothing can exceed the bottom at the mouth of captening appears of equal goodness with the one below it thursday   th—the canoe set off at sunrise as i did to view that bottom opposite to the mouth of pipe creek in passing over the neck i found the lower part was very rich upon the river towards the hills with well timbered and not only in places the middle back of the rich bottom is black  0  and white oak land fit for farming or any purpose whatever and intermixed with meadows the upper end is as rich quite to the hills which are as ever i saw but subject to freshes        the course of the creek which meanders through a bottom of fine land especially at the forks where there appears a large body of it the vail through which this creek runs as far as we could see up it appears to be wide and the soil of the hills which confines it good tho very steep in some places on this creek which heads up a little to the southward of redstone settlement there is according to the indians account and all the accounts i could get a great deal of fine land the body of flat land at the forks is but a very little way from the river in a direct line and may contain i guess a thousand acres or more below the mouth of this creek there is a bottom of pretty good land but not large and about five miles above at the mouth of a small run which comes in at the lower point of an island and which by mistake i called octo    fishing creek there is a bottom of as fine land as can possibly be but not large containing not more than two or three hundred acres at the head of this bottom and a little below the second cross creek we encamped distant from our last thirteen or fourteen miles here it was for the second time the old indian with me spoke of a fine piece of land and beautiful place for a house and in order to give me a more lively idea of it chalked out the situation on his deer skin it lies upon bull creek at least thirty miles from the mouth but not more than five from the mouth of muddy creek in an e s e direction the spot he recommends for a house lies very high commanding a prospect of a great deal of level land below on the creek—the ground about it very rich and a fine spring in the middle of it about which many buffaloes use and have made great roads bull creek according to his  0  account runs parellel with the long reach in the ohio and not above six or seven miles from it having fine bottoms which widen as they extend into the country and towards the head of it is large bodies of level rich land   th—by this morning the river had fallen in the whole two or three and twenty feet and was still lowering about eight oclock we set out and passing the lower cross creeks we came to a pretty long and tolerably wide and good bottom on the east side of the river then comes in the hills just above which is buffalo creek a creek i neither saw nor remarked in going down upon which and above it between that and the cross creeks near the mingo town distant three or four miles is a bottom of exceeding fine land but not very large unless it extends up the creek about three oclock we came to the town without seeing our horses the indian who was sent express for them having passed through only the morning before being detained by the creeks which were too high to ford without going high up them here we resolved to wait their arrival which was expected tomorrow and here then will end our water voyage along a river the general course of which from beaver creek to the kenhawa is about southwest as near as i could determine but in its windings through a narrow vale extremely serpentine forming on both sides of the river alternately necks of very good bottoms some exceedingly fine lying for the most part in the shape of a halfmoon and of various sizes there is very little difference in the general width of the river from fort pitt to the kenhawa but in the depth i believe the odds are considerably in favor of the lower parts as we found no shallows below the mingo town except in one or two places where the river was broad and there i do not know but there might have been a deep channel in some part of it every here and there are islands some larger and some smaller which operating in the nature of locks or steps occasion pretty still water above but for the most part strong and rapid water alongside of them however there is none of these so swift but that a vessel may be rowed or set up with poles when the river is in its natural state large canoes that will carry five or six thousand weight or more may be worked against stream by four hands twenty or twentyfive miles a day and down a   0 good deal more the indians who are very dexterous even their women in the management of canoes have their huntingcamps and cabins all along the river for the convenience of transporting their skins by water to market in the fall so soon as the huntingseason comes on they set out with their families for this purpose and in hunting will move their camps from place to place till by the spring they get two or three hundred or more miles from their towns then beaver catch it in their way up which frequently brings them into the month of may when the women are employed in planting the men at market and in idleness till the fall again when they pursue the same course during the summer months they live a poor and perishing life the indians who reside upon the ohio the upper parts of it at least are composed of shawanees delawares and some of the mingoes who getting but little part of the consideration that was given for the lands eastward of the ohio view the settlement of the people upon this river with an uneasy and jealous eye and do not scruple to say that they must be compensated for their right if the people settle thereon notwithstanding the cession of the six nations thereto on the other hand the people from virginia and elsewhere are exploring and marking all the lands that are valuable not only on redstone and other waters of the monongahela but along down the ohio as low as the little kenhawa and by next summer i suppose will get to the great kenhawa at least how difficult it may be to contend with these people afterwards is easy to be judged from every days experience of lands actually settled supposing these to be made than which nothing is more probable if the indians permit them from the disposition of the people at present a few settlements in the midst of some of the large bottoms would render it impracticable to get any large quantity of land together as the hills all the way down the river as low as i went come pretty close and are steep and broken incapable of settlements though some of them are rich and only fit to support the bottoms with timber and wood the land back of the bottoms as far as i have been able to judge either from my own observations or from information is nearly the same that is exceeding uneven and hilly and i do presume that there are no bodies of flat rich land to be found till one gets far     enough from the river to head the little runs and drains that come through the hills and to the sources or near them of the creeks and their branches this it seems is the case of the lands upon monongahela and youghiogany and i fancy holds good upon this river till you get into the flat lands or near them below the falls the bottom land differs a good deal in quality that highest up the river in general is richest tho the bottoms are neither so wide nor long as those below walnut  cherry and some other woods that grow snarly and neither tall nor large but covered with grape vines with the fruit of which this country at this instant abounds are the growth of the richest bottoms but on the other hand these bottoms appear to me to be the lowest and most subject to floods the sugartree and ash mixed with walnut c compose the growth of the next richest low grounds beech poplar oaks c the last the soil of this is also good but inferior to either of the other kinds and beech bottoms are excepted against on account of the difficulty of clearing them their roots spreading over a large surface of ground and being hard to kill sunday   th—agreed with two delaware indians to carry up our canoe to fort pitt for the doing of which i was to pay six dollars and give them a quart tin can monday   th—the delawares set off with the canoe and our horses not arriving the day appeared exceeding long and tedious upon conversing with nicholson i found he had been two or three times to fort chartres at the illinois and got from him the following account of the lands between this and that and upon the shawna river on which he had been hunting the lands down the ohio grow more and more level as you approach the falls and about   0 miles below them the country appears quite flat and exceeding rich on the shawna river which comes into the ohio  00 miles below the falls and about   00 from pittsburg up which he had hunted  00 and more miles the lands are exceeding level rich and fine but a good deal intermixed with cane or reed which might render them difficult to clear that game of all kinds was to be found here in the greatest abundance especially buffalo that from fort chartres to pittsburg by land is computed  00 miles and in travelling     thro the country from that place he found the soil very rich the ground exceeding level to opost a french settlement and from opost to the lower shawna town on scioto equally flat that he passed through large plains thirty miles in length without a tree except little islands of wood that in these plains thousands and tens of thousands of buffalo may be seen feeding that the distance from fort chartres to opost is about   0 miles and the country not very well watered from opost to the lower shawna town is about  00 more abounding in good springs and rivulets that the remainder of the way to fort pitt is hilly and the hills larger as you approach the fort tho the land in general is also good at fort pitt i got the distances from place to place down the ohio as taken by one mr hutchings and which are as follows with some corrections of mine— from fort pitt to   miles logstown  w   ½ big beaver creek  w   ½ racoon creek gw e    little beaver

computation but from thence to the mouth of river ohio are strictly according to hutchings account which account i take to be erroneous inasmuch as it appears that the miles in the upper parts of the river are very long and those towards the kanhawa short which i attribute to his setting off in a falling fresh and running slower as he proceeded on the letters e and w signify which side of the river the respective waters come in on that is whether on the east or west side  0th—about one oclock our horses arrived having been prevented from getting to fort pitt by the freshes at two we set

thirtyfive from the mingo town the land between the mingo town and pittsburg is of different kinds for four or five miles after leaving the first mentioned place we passed over steep hilly ground hurt with stone covered with whiteoak and a thin shallow soil this was succeeded by a lively whiteoak land less broken and this again by rich land the growth of which was chiefly white and redoak mixed which lasted with some intervals of indifferent ridges all the way to pittsburg it was very observable that as we left the river the land grew better which is a confirmation of the accounts i had before received that the good bodies of land lie upon the heads of the runs and creeks but in all my travels through this country i have seen no large body of level land on the branches of raccoon creek there appears to be good meadow ground and on shurtees creek over both which we passed the land looks well the country between the mingo town and fort pitt appears to be well supplied with springs thursday   d—stayed at pittsburg all day invited the officers and some other gentlemen to dinner with me at semples among whom was one dr connolly nephew to colonel croghan a very sensible intelligent man who had travelled over a good     deal of this western country both by land and water and confirms nicholsons account of the good land on the shawna river up which he had been near four hundred miles this country i mean on the shawna river according to dr connollys description must be exceedingly desirable on many accounts the climate is exceeding fair the soil remarkably good the lands well watered with good streams and level enough for any kind of cultivation besides these advantages from nature it has others not less important to a new settlement particularly game which is so plenty as not only to render the transportation of provisions there bread only excepted altogether unnecessary but to enrich the adventurers with the peltry for which there is a constant and good market dr connolly is so much delighted with the lands and climate on that river that he seems to wish for nothing more than to induce one hundred families to go there and live that he might be among them a new and most desirable government might be established there to be bounded according to his account by the ohio northward and westward the ridge that divides the waters of the tennessee or cherokee river southward and westward and a line to be run from the falls of ohio or above so as to cross the shawna river above the fork of it dr connolly gives much the same account of the land between fort chartres in the illinois country and post st vincent opost that nicholson does except in the article of water which the doctor says is bad and in the summer scarce there being little else than stagnate water to be met with friday   d—after settling with the indians and people that attended me down the river and defraying the sundry expenses accruing at pittsburg i set off on my return

annapolis his mind is a good deal released     from study  more than ever turnd to dogs horses and guns indeed upon dress and equipage which till of late he has discovered little inclination of giving into i must beg the favor of you therefore to keep him close to those useful branches of learning which he ought now to be acquainted with and as much as possible under your own eye without these i fear he will too soon think himself above controul and be not much the better for the extraordinary expence attending his living in annapolis which i should be exceeding sorry for as nothing but a hasty progress towards the completion of his education can justifie my keeping him there at such an expence as his estate will now become chargeable with the time of life he is now advancing into requires the most friendly aid and council especially in such a place as annapolis otherwise the warmth of his own passions assisted by the bad example of other youth may prompt him to actions derogatory of virtue  that innocence of manners which one coud wish to preserve him in for wch reason i would beg leave to request that he may not be suffered to sleep from under your own roof unless it be at such places as you are sure he can have no bad examples set him nor allow him to be rambling about of nights in company with those who do not care how debauched and viceous his conduct may be you will be so good i hope as to excuse the liberty i have taken in offering my sentiments thus freely—i have his welbeing much at heart  should     be sorry to see him fall into any vice or evil course which there is a possibility of restraining him from  george washington jan  nd      mount vernon jonathan boucher to dr boucher mount vernon jan  nd      jacks return has been delayed as well from a belief that you might not be well settled as from a desire of gratifying him in his favourite amusement of hunting these hollidays he returns now he says with a determination of applying close to his studies and i confide entirely in your promise of making him do so as time slips off a pace and other ideas  pursuits will soon render it more difficult to keep him     confined to them than at present in respect to the kinds  manner of his studying i leave it wholely to your better judgment—had he begun or rather pursued his study of the greek language i should have thought it no bad acquisition but whether if he acquire this now he may not forego some more useful branches of learning is a matter worthy of consideration to be acquainted with the french tongue is become a part of polite education and to a man who has the prospect of mixing in a large circle absolutely necessary without arithmetick the common affairs of life are not to be managed with   0 success the study of geometry and the mathematics with due regard to the limites of it is equally advantageous the principles of philosophy moral natural c i should think a very desirable knowledge for a gentleman but as i said before i leave the whole to your direction with this earnest request that in whatever kind of study you think proper to engage him he may be kept diligently to it for he really has no time to loose the shortness of the distance between this and your present habitation will i hope give us the pleasure of seeing you and miss boucher often at mount vernon in this hope mrs washington also rests and with her compliments and wishes joind with mine for the return of many happy  prosperous years to you i remain with great sincerity etc      george washington june  th      mount vernon jonathan boucher to dr boucher  mount vernon june  th      i should have set mr custis off for annapolis as soon as i heard of your passing by being very unwilling that he should loose any time from school that is possible to be avoided but it was thought necessary to keep him till his cloaths could be washd  got in readiness to take with him which has detained him till now—by him i send you £ 0 maryld curry the sum wrote for in your last inclosing at the same time doctr stevensons letter and acct which i beg the favour of you to pay as     soon as convenient agreeable to his request—the money thus receivd  paid you will please to credit and charge according to the rates which the different kinds of specie pass in the respective governments otherwise i shoud be a considerable looser between   ⅓   0 pr ct the proportion which the two currencies bear to sterling leaving a difference of   ⅓ between virga  maryland when in fact with us upon this river who receive dollrs at   the real difference is only    pr ct—at ye utmost  0 in respect to the other matters contained in your letter of the  th ulto i shall endeavour to be as explicit as i can and first in regard to mr custis going to england—my own inclinations have always been strong in favour of his prosecuting the plan you formerly laid down for him—his friends a good deal divided in theirs—some on acct of the expence others as being almost the last of a family think he shoud run no risks that are to be avoided—these opinions tho they are insufficient to biass my own judgment in this matter as i think the more conspicuous the point of view a man is to appear in the more pains should be taken to enlarge his mind and qualify him for a useful member of society yet they determined me in some measure not to appear sollicitous or forward in promoting it but leave things a little more to their own workings and to the turn and disposition of the youth himself after his genius is a little more unfolded and he better able to have an opinion of his own—in this state of mind i was when your prospects of a change      doubts about accompanying him were communicated to me which will have no small weight in turning the scale for however desirable it may be to see him travel if his income shoud be thought by genl court sufficient to admit of the expence under the care of a gentleman who would endeavour to guard  steer him clear of those follies  vices which youth almost imperceptably falls into at the same time that he was instilling into him taste for useful knowledge and improvement yet i must own i should never wish to see him set out for england at his time of life recommended to the care of a merchant only—or to embark on a tour of the kind you proposed without a conductor as pleasure and dissipation without a kirb would leave little room for study  more than probably end in his ruin i am therefore more perplexd than ever i was  find the difficulty of giving a defenitive answer encreased by your doubts and can only add that when the period arrives at which you think it eligible for him to set out on a tour of this kind it will if it appears to be his own desire upon a probability of your intention  your inclination to accompany him meet with my hearty concurrence notwithstanding the expense farther than this i do not think myself at liberty to decide i conceive there is much greater circumspection to be observed by a guardian than a natural parent who is only accountable to his own conscience for his conduct whereas any faupas in a guardian however well meant the action seldom fails to meet with malicious construction and often     subjects the party to inconvenience which is troublesome to get relieved from—this opinion of mine is not known to my ward—he believes for anything i know to the contrary that his trip to england is resolvd on— i should be glad if his time was devoted to the study of those useful branches of learning as will render him fit for it i very sincerely congratulate you on the prospect of your change to a parish not far distant from this  should be glad to see you soon confirmd in a benefice equal to the full extent of your wishes—colo colvil by his will left the legatees in england five years to put in their claim  proove their right this time will not expire till the  th day of octr next—as to mr johnsons physick as he has been so obliging to provide it you will be so good as when an opportunity offers to send it over tho if it be some of the last nothing is to be expected from it that was used without having in the smallest degree the desired effect i cannot conclude without requesting in the most importunate manner that all due attention and consideration may be given to jacks education—i fear the progress he has made in classical knowledge has of late been trifling as i cannot discover that he is much farther in latten than when he left mr magowan knows little arithmetick and is quite ignorant of the greek language which he has begun under the tuition of that gentleman  therefore as well as from some enquiries which i have lately made apprehend that he lacks that attention     which is necessary to advance him in his studies—the information which i have but just come to the knowledge of has filled me with a sincere concern not because of the expence attendg his living in annapolis were it   times as great but on acct of the lost time which is never to be regained—duty  inclination both prompt me to mention this matter to you as i have his improvement much at heart and wd wittingly leave nothing unattempted on my part to see this accomplished i am with mrs washingtons compliments and thanks for your attention to jack in the small pox  if  fees a £   £   0 0 fares

the   th december from georgia and  0th of april from charlestown came duely to hand in answer to them i have only to inform you     that my advertisements which you refer to were issued in consequence of instructions from our late governor and council and that i have nothing more to do in the affair than to receive  deliver in to them the several claims of the respective officers  soldiers who embarked in the service of this colony in the year      under a proclamation of the then governor offering a reward of  00000 acres of land to all those who shoud voluntarily engage in an expedition against the french who were at that time encroaching on his majestys lands on the ohio among those who embarked under this encouragement was your son and well entitled not only by proclamation but by his merit and bravery to a lieutenants share of the lands which no doubt he if any of us do will obtain as i have exhibited your claim for that purpose—nothing final however is determined on with respect to this matter—you will stand upon the same footing with the rest of the claimants provided you contribute in the same proportion towards the incidental charges attending the surveys c which are now set about  for which each subaltern officer has already been calld upon for the respective sums of £  and £ — 0—0—current money of this government in order to prosecute the work it will behoove you therefore to give some person a power of attorney to act on your behalf who must be furnished with the means of contributing your quota past and to come for furthering of this business which must from the nature of it be attended with trouble and expense i know of no person better     qualified to serve you in this matter than the one who first exhibited your claim i mean mr alexr craig who is a resident of williamsburg a man of very fair character and lays more in the way of receiving your instructions and communicating such information as may be proper for you to receive than i should be or any one else i am acquainted with it may not be amiss to add for your further satisfaction that all the claims are not yet given in consequently the proportion and value of the land which may fall to each officers share is not fully ascertained and that we have many difficulties  some uncertainties to struggle through before our right to these lands will be fully recognized such powerful sollicitation is there at the court of great britain for the lands to the westward of us where our grant was located and such the opposition we meet with tho it is hoped that the equity of our claim will at length prevail      in which case the land will be well worth the trouble and expence we may bestow to obtain it notwithstanding the remote distance it is from navigation     i am much obliged to you for the favorable opinion you are pleasd to entertain of me and wish i may continue to deserve it and approve myself sir c     george washington   july      mount vernon jonathan boucher to dr boucher mount vernon   july      sear sir from several concurring causes which have assembled upon the eve of my departure for williamsburg i have both my head and my hands too full of business to allow me time to write more than a hasty undigested answer to your letter of the  th this however i shall attempt to do in my last i informed you as well as i can recollect the contents of the letter that the friends i do not confine myself to the relations of mr custis were divided in their opinions of the propriety of his travelling not on account of the advantages which might result from it but on account of the expense as he would set out with so heavy a charge as you thought sufficient to induce you to accompany him which would at once anticipate half his income for his estate is of a kind that rather comes under the denomination of a large than a profitable one he has a good deal of land and a great many slaves it is true but the former is more to be esteemed for the situation than the produce being of an indifferent quality and much worn so that large crops cannot be made from them these doubtful opinions was a sufficient cause i added for me to be circumspect in my conduct as i had another tribunal to account to besides that in my own breast for the part i was to act on this occasion for you cannot but know that every farthing which is expended on this young gentleman must undergo the inspection of the general   0 court in their examination of my guardianship accounts and that it would never answer for me to permit him to launch into any uncommon or extravagant tract especially at a time when a heavy and expensive chancery suit is just commenced against his estate without first knowing whether such an expence would be submitted to by those who had a constitutional right to put a negative thereon these are the reasons why i said in my last that my own inclinations were still as strong as ever for mr custiss pursuing his travelling scheme but that it was necessary the court should approve of the expense i did not want their opinion of the utility of travelling and provided that it should appear when his judgment is a little more matured that he is desirous of undertaking this tour upon a plan of improvement rather than a vague desire of gratifying an idle curiosity or spending his money wantonly for by the bye if his mother does not speak her sentiments rather than his he is abundantly lukewarm in the scheme and i cannot help giving it as my opinion that his education from what i have understood of his improvements however advanced it may be for a youth of his age is by no means ripe enough for a tour of travelling not that i think his becoming a mere scholar is a desirable education for a gentleman but i conceive a knowledge of books is the basis upon which other knowledge is to be built and that it is men and things more than books he is to be acquainted with by travelling at present however well versed he may be in the principles of the latin     language which is not to be at all wondered at as he began the study of it as soon as he could speak he is unacquainted with several of their classical authors which might be useful to him to read he is ignorant of the greek which the advantages of understanding i do not pretend to judge knows nothing of french which is absolutely necessary to him as a traveller little or nothing acquainted with arithmetic and totally ignorant of the mathematics than which so much of it at least as relates to surveying nothing can be more essentially necessary to any person possessed of a large landed estate the bounds of some part or other of which is always in controversy now whether he has time between this and next spring to acquire a sufficient knowledge of these or so much of them as are requisite i leave you to judge of and whether a boy of seventeen years old which will be his age the last of november next can have any just notions of the end and design of travelling i have already given it as my opinion that it would be precipitating this event unless he was to go immediately to the university for a couple of years and in this case he could see nothing of america which might be a disadvantage to him as it is to be expected that every man who travels with a view of observing the laws and customs of other countries should be able to give some description of the situation and government of his own upon the whole it is impossible for me at this time to give a more decisive answer however strongly inclined i may be to put you upon an absolute certainty     in this affair than i have done and should think myself wanting in candor if i concealed any circumstance from you which leads me to fear that there is a possibility if not a probability that the whole design may be totally defeated and therefore i add that before i ever thought myself at liberty to encourage this plan i judged it highly reasonable and necessary that the mother should be consulted i laid your first letter and proposals before her and desired that she would ponder well before she resolved as an unsteady behavior might be a disadvantage to you her determination was that if it appeared to be his inclination to undertake this tour and if it should be adjudged for his benefit she would not oppose it whatever pangs it might give her to part with him this declaration she still adheres to but in so faint a manner that i think what with her fears and his indifference if he really is so it will soon be declared that he has no inclination to go the consequence of which is too obvious to be mentioned i do not say that this will be the case i cannot speak positively but as this is the result of my own reflection upon the matter i thought it but fair to communicate it to you several causes i believe have concurred to make her view his departure as the time approaches with more reluctance than she expected the unhappy situation of her daughter has in some degree fixed her eyes upon him as her only hope add to this the doubts of her friends c to what i have already said i can only add that my warmest wishes are to     see him prosecute a plan at a proper period which i am sure will redound to his advantage and that nothing shall be wanted on my part to aid and assist him in it in the event of his going i should think myself highly favored and him much honored by governor edens letters of introduction such with others that might be procured can not fail of having their advantages you will please to make my compliments to mr dulany and assure him that i have not the vestige of a house at the frederic springs otherwise it should have been if unengaged much at his service the two seasons i spent at those waters i stood indebted to mr mercer for the use of his house i scarce know what answer to give to the papers you transmitted to me as an executor of the will of col thos colvill deceased the affairs of that estate are unhappily involved with mr semple to whom colo colvill in his life time sold a tract of land in maryland called merryland for i think £  00 sterling and from whom we can neither get the money nor land till this matter is settled the executors are unable to pay off the legacies in this country consequently can answer no demands of the residuary legatees in england who only come in for the surplusage if any there be i believe there will be more than sufficient to discharge the debts and legacies here but the overplus will be trifling i remain c      george washington  0 july      mt vernon to robert cary  co mt vernon  0 july      gentlemen our goods by the liberty captn walker came to hand in good order and soon after his arrival as they generally will do when shipped in a vessel to this river and scarcely ever when they go to any others unless they should be despatched in one of your own ships and the captain particularly instructed concerning the delivery of them for it dont often happen that a vessel bound to one river has goods of any consequence for another and the masters in these cases keep the packages till an accidental conveyance offers and for want of better opportunities frequently commit them to boatmen who care very little for the goods so they get their freight and often land them where it suits their convenience not where they have engaged to do which was the case of those parcels sent by saunderson it is to little purpose therefore to recommend it to us to seek redress of the masters for these delays or abuses though it may be the only remedy left unless the injury is of so extensive a nature as to make it worth while to be at some expense and trouble to watch for and find out the captains our situation in this country differs very widely from yours a ship going from virginia to london is always and with ease to be met with at that part but a ship from london to virginia may be in rappahannock or any of the other rivers three months before i know anything of her arrival and may make twenty voyages without my seeing or     even hearing of the captain in the same manner that vessels may trade to liverpool whitehaven or bristol unknown to you it is more expedient therefore to prevent the evil than to redress it afterwards and this is very easily done by sending the goods out in ships belonging to the river they are destined for so much in answer for that part of your letter of the   th of november advising me to make saunderson a man i never saw in my life and perhaps never shall pay the extra expence i was put to in getting my goods from mr blands warehouse at boyds hole there are several other passages in the letter above mentioned that i think it incumbent upon me to take some notice of not that i am fond of dwelling upon a subject that is full as disagreeable to me as it can be to you but because there is one paragraph in particular in it respecting the windsor glass which appears to me to contain an implication of my having deviated from the truth why else should you require in the name of the person you bought of a square to be sent you and what end was it to answer but to charge me indirectly with a misrepresentation of the fact for if it was supposed by mrs dennis that i had related a falsehood it might as well have been imagined that i would have practised a deceit as there could have been no difficulty in making mrs ann dennis a square of   by  0 out of   and    and any one who would condescend to practise the one would not hesitate to execute the other but however credulous i may have been in relation to the prices of tobacco i could not well     have been so in respect to the measurement of the glass when i built a house with sashes   by    and got squares that would not fit them i do not repeat this matter with a view of having any allowance made me—i neither want nor would accept of any but to show that it is much more likely mrs dennis should put up a box of   by  0 through carelessness or by mistake than that i should mistake the size when i came to use it i had nothing more in view when i made the complaint first than to shew how inattentive the tradesmen and shopkeepers sometimes are that i might be relieved from the like inconveniences for the time to come this was my reason also for taking notice of the duffield from mauduit  co  not that i expected any deduction from the price as they could not see the condition of the cloth for want of my having an opportunity of reshipping it an inconvenience we are obliged to submit to and is among the disadvantages attending my shipping to a house that has no connection with the river i live on and it is seldom we have it in our power of sending any little trifling matters which want repairs alterations c to london not choosing to put captains of vessels with whom we have no concern nor any way of obliging in return to any trouble in sending for or taking charge of them so likewise is it a disadvantage on account of your letters which come chiefly by york and james river ships by which means i have the postage from williamsburg to alexandria always     to pay which upon a letter that contains an account of sales or that has anything else enclosed amounts often to four five and sometimes eight or ten shillings which in the end increases to no trifling sum i observe what you have said in respect to the purchase of our goods with ready cash it is what those who have money in your hands or who pay interest for the loan of yours have an undoubted right to expect and if we are allowed the benefits of debenture and the prompt payment of goods for i am told the tradesmen and shopkeepers generally if not always make out their notes on twelve or more months credit according to the general run of their dealings and then discount according to the payments—i say if these are allowed it is all we have a right to expect and yet i do aver that i can buy linen and many other articles in the stores here in their sterling way of dealing cheaper than i can import them which is a mystery not easy to be accounted for as i do not conceive that you are charged the retail prices for the goods you purchase for though the quantity that i or any other individual may want is small yet when it is considered that one person has a demand for twenty pounds worth another for fifty a third for an hundred and so on to the amount of thousands for any article linen for example to be shipped off at one and the same time surely the whole is of dignity enough to bring you under the denomination of a wholesale purchaser and sufficient to entitle you to all the benefits of a drawback upon the exported goods this is the light in which things     have always appeared to me i may be mistaken however in my conjectures for want of better knowledge of trade and if i expect any thing that is unreasonable or inconsistent with the principles of a just fair and practicable commerce i am sure i do not desire to be indulged in it but i cannot help adding that it has ever been my opinion that in return for the heavy charges upon our tobacco and the ample and uncommon commissions which are drawn upon the sales of it we ought to reap every advantage which can be procured in the purchase of our goods otherwise i should be glad to know to what end we import them    our association in virginia for the nonimportation of goods is now at an end except against tea paper glass and painters colors of foreign manufacture you will please therefore to be careful that none of the glass paper c contained in my invoices are of those kinds which are subject to the duty imposed by parliament for the purpose of raising a revenue in america the late great calamity which has befallen this country by the overflowing of the waters will be communicated to you i expect through so many different channels that it is scarce worth my while to touch upon the subject neither my ward nor self has sustained any damage by this disaster but it is expected that it cannot fail to have some effect upon the prices of tobacco in which case we suppose ours will reap the advantage of it as well as

afternoon george washington   november      williamsburg george mercer to george mercer london  williamsburg   november      dear sir   since you first left this country i have been favored with two letters from you one of them serving to enter your own and the claims of captains stobo   0 and vanbraam to part of the two hundred thousand acres of land granted under governor dinwiddies proclamation and the other of the   th of december which did not come to my hands till about the first of last month urging the expediency of prosecuting our right to those lands with spirit in respect to the first i have only to inform you that your own claim as well that for your brother as yourself was entered before the receipt of your letter and that stobos and vanbraams are also entered in answer to the second i can only add that the same backwardness which has ever appeared in our honorable board to recognise our right to these lands seems still to prevail and that our business in this affair is by no means in that forwardness which i could wish owing i believe i may say to other causes as well as to a lukewarmness in those from whom we seek redress the unequal interest and dispersed situation of the claimants make a regular coöperation difficult an undertaking of this kind cannot be conducted without a good deal of expense and trouble and the doubt of obtaining the lands after the utmost efforts is such as to discourage the larger part of the claimants from lending assistance     whilst a few are obliged to wade through every difficulty or relinquish every hope in this state of things and in behalf of those who had contributed to the expense of exploring and surveying the lands i petitioned the governor and council that the amount of each mans share according to his rank should be ascertained and each claimant suffered to designate and survey his portion separately by which means every man would stand upon his own footing this petition i thought so reasonable and so consistent with every principle of common justice to say nothing of the disadvantage of being forced into large tracts and the manifest inconvenience of dividing them afterwards that i conceived it could not possibly be rejected but to my great astonishment it was so and we are now compelled to be at the expense of surveying our whole quantity in twenty surveys and then each individual subjected to the charge of surveying his own separately in this way we are doubly taxed while the whole is held as a kind of joint interest and no man knows his property or can tell how or in what manner to dispose of it in short so many glaring obstacles opposed their mode of proceeding that they did not even attempt to remove them but contented themselves with putting the soldiers upon a worse footing than the meanest individual in the community rather than be thought to give a license for the pillaging of his majestys or the proprietary lands when it is a fact well known and every age evinces it that no country ever was or ever will be     settled without some indulgence what inducements have men to explore uninhabited wilds but the prospect of getting good lands would any man waste his time expose his fortune nay life in such a search if he was to share the good and the bad with those that come after him surely not we have surveyed ten of the largest tracts we can find in the district allowed us and have been able to get sixty thousand acres and for this tract we have been obliged to go between two and three hundred miles below fort pitt as the lands thereabouts are thought to be within the pennsylvania government at least they are surveyed under those rights and held by such a number of individuals that it was thought to be impolitic to engage in private disputes whilst there appeared but a gloomy prospect of getting any land at all the claims which have been presented to me are now all given in and the governor and council have determined that each officer shall share according to the rank in which he entered the service and that the land shall be distributed in the following manner namely to each fieldofficer fifteen thousand acres to each captain nine thousand to each subaltern six thousand to the cadets two thousand five hundred each six hundred to a sergeant five hundred to a corporal and four hundred to each private soldier they have made a reserve of thirty thousand acres as well to provide for any claims which may hereafter come in as to compensate those who have been and must necessarily continue to be saddled with the expense     which we find will not be very inconsiderable as we have already expended near two hundred pounds and the surveyor not yet paid  this expense must now be greatly augmented as we shall be exposed to a considerable charge in exploring the lands before we can proceed to survey any more from every thing we know at present it appears impossible to get two hundred thousand acres in twenty surveys without including mountains and inhospitable hills to the amount of near one half which will render the grant of little value and be the     source of much discontent at a division it behooves us therefore to examine the lands well before we survey and allow me to add that it will be very proper for you to give messrs stobo and vanbraam a hint that something more than entering their claims is necessary i dare say they will hardly think it reasonable to profit by the labor and purse of others it is highly incumbent on them therefore to appoint an agent in this country to transact their business and advance their proportion of the expense if they expect to share in the lands to give you a minute detail of the proceedings respecting this grant would be a work of time and afford you little entertainment what i have here said will serve as a general outline and that is all i have aimed at in this letter i should not have delayed answering your first letter till this time had you not mentioned your intention of embarking soon on your return this account having been frequently corroborated by your brother of whom i often inquired after you i thought a letter could have little chance of finding you in england i have just been told by mr mercer that you are to remain in london for some advices from him respecting the affairs of the ohio company mrs washington makes a tender of her compliments to you and i am with very sincere regard dear sir your most obedient humble servant     george washington    november      mt vernon robert stobo to robert stobo mt vernon    november      dear sir your claim to a share of the  00000 acres of land under governor dinwiddies proclamation has been entered and the governor and council have settled the proportions which fall to each mans lot according to the rank he entered the service with by which each field officer is allowed   000 acres each captain  000 each subaltern  000 each cadet   00 a sergeant  00 a corporal  00 and each private soldier  00 acres apiece the soliciting this matter with some other expences that have attended the prosecution of our claim have cost a few individuals upwards of £ 00 already and instead of getting one half the land contiguous to the forks of monongahela now fort pitt where they are of some value we are obliged to go down the ohio near  00 miles lower and take the land in twenty surveys by which means and the nature of that country which you know is very hilly and broken we shall be obliged to include a large portion of bad land so as not only to render the grant of little value but will create a good deal of discontent at a division as it is absolutely impossible to make an equal distribution of the good and bad nor divide it by lot as different ranks are entitled to different quantities and when all is done what plague and trouble we are yet to meet with from the proprietors of the new government to the westward of us whose grant includes every inch of the land we     are expecting under our order of council i know not time only can reveal it the expence attending the grant of ours is in a manner but just beginning as we have not surveyed a third part of the land yet and are laid under the inconvenience and hardship of first exploring the country then surveying our whole quantity in twenty surveys and after that each man his particular quantity separately—a grievance we have labored much to get removed but could not it is therefore incumbent upon you to appoint an agent here to attend to your interest in these lands who should be enabled to contribute your proportion of the expense for without money the business cannot go forward even if the way was smooth much less where there are difficulties in every stage of it what i have here said will just serve to give you some idea of this affair to relate the whole proceedings with the troubles and vexations that have accompanied them in stating our claims drawing petitions presenting memorials c c would require a volume and afford little entertainment           george washington  th may      mount vernon jonathan boucher to dr boucher mount vernon  th may      after a tiresome and in my opinion a very unimportant session i returned home about the middle of last month accompanied by colo bassett c the expediency of an american episcopate was long  warmly debated and at length rejected as a substitute the house attempted to frame an ecclesiastical jurisdiction to be composed of a president and four other clergymen who were to have full power and authority to hear and determine all matters and causes relative to the clergy and to be vested with the power of suspension deprivation  visitation from this jurisdiction an appeal was to be     had to a court of delegates to consist of an equal number of clergymen and laymen but this bill after much canvassing was put to sleep from an opinion that the subject was of too much importance to be hastily entered into at the end of a session—an act has passed this session empowering trustees to be chosen by ye subscribers to the scheme to raise money by way of subscription  lottery for the purpose of opening  extending the navigation of potomack from the tide water to fort cumberland  for perpetuating the toll arising from vessells to the adventurers in the scheme —but ye execution of it must necessarily be suspended till some thing similar passes into a law in your province—an act has also passed for erecting a light house on cape henry from which i think the shipping will derive great advantages —and a bill went through the house but rejected in the council for having septennial vestrys and a general dissolution of all those now in existence herewith i send the pamphlets you desird me to get together with your accts from both printing offices discharged both printers being desired to forward your gazettes for the future to the care of mr lowndes of bladensburg i expected to have made you a visit soon after my return from williamsburg and to have gone from thence to annapolis but am a little uncertain now when it will be in my power to enjoy this pleasure as i have business that will call me into loudoun     fauquier and berkeley one of the new counties taken from frederick the other dunmore sometime between the middle  last of this month  am now engaged in fishing and other matters which seems i think to require my attendance george washington   st may      mount vernon jonathan boucher to dr boucher mount vernon   st may      inclination having yielded to importunity i am now contrary to all expectation under the hands of mr peale but in so grave—so sullen a mood—and now and then under the influence of morpheus when some critical strokes are making that i fancy the skill of this gentlemans pencil will be put to it in describing to the world what manner of man i am i have no doubt of mr peales  meeting with very good incouragement in a tour to williamsburg for having mentioned him to some gentlemen at our court they seem desirous of employing him in his way down    0 your excuse for denying us the pleasure of your company with governor eden  lady tho not strictly warranted by scripture is nevertheless highly admissable and i sincerely congratulate you upon the prospect of happiness as i think there is a fair field of it opening to your view from the judiciousness of your choice—whether mrs washington ever stretches as far as annapolis or not we shall certainly take some very early opportunity of making your acquaintance on this occasion may   d the foregoing letter was designed to go by jack custis who intended as he said but afterwards altered his mind to take the benefit of a ball at alexandria on thursday evening in his way home the next day—in the interim joe brought me your favor of the   st forbidding us any longer to hope for the pleasure of govr eden and ladys company which we had been flattering ourselves with the honor of for several days  which i now beg the favor of you to assure them we regret at the same time i am further to ask you to apologize to mr eden for my not paying my respects to him at mr digges which i fully intended to do but falling under mr peales hands that morning in a regular rotation he kept me so long knowing that it was his custom of asking that i had not time to visit him     before dinner and the govr you wrote me he was to set out for mr rogers after it—be pleased to assure mr and mrs eden which you may do with great truth that mrs washington and myself shall think ourselves very happy in seeing them at mount vernon whenever they can make it convenient to give us the honor of their company i find upon enquiry that it will not be in my power to supply you and mr calvert with the weathers you want the rot or some other distemper among my sheep swept off near an hundred in the space of a month this spring for me—i am much obliged to mr galloway for the claret and as i have no immediate use for it having a box or two by me i must trouble mr digges for house room for it till i return from my trip upward george washington    june      mount vernon lord dunmore to lord dunmore lieutenant governor of virginia  mount vernon    june       my lord the very obliging offer your lordship was pleased to make the day i left williamsburg in behalf of the officers and soldiers who under the faith of government     lay claim to two hundred thousand acres of land on the waters of the ohio promised them by proclamation in      i did not embrace because it is evident to me who am in some degree acquainted with the situation of that country and the rapid progress now making in the settlement of it that delay at this time in the prosecution of our plan would amount to the loss of the land inasmuch as immigrants are daily and hourly settling on the choice spots and waiting a favorable opportunity to solicit     legal titles on the ground of preoccupancy when the office shall be opened i therefore hoped and the the officers and soldiers who have suffered in the cause of their country still hope that although your lordship was of opinion you could not at that time vest them with an absolute and bonâ fide grant of the land yet that you will permit them to take such steps at their own expense and risk as others do to secure their lands agreeably to proclamation especially as their claim is prior to any other and better founded they having a solemn act of government and the general voice of the country in their favor this is the light my lord in which the matter appeared to me and in this light it is also considered by the officers with whom i have lately had a meeting the report gains ground that a large tract of country on the ohio including every foot of land to the westward of the allegany mountains is granted to a company of gentlemen in england to be formed into a separate government if this report is really well founded there can be no doubt of your lordships having the earliest and most authentic accounts of it since it so essentially interferes with the interests and expectations of this country to request the favor of your lordship to inform me whether this report be true and if true whether any attention has been or probably will be paid to the order of council and proclamation of      may be presumptuous but as the officers and soldiers confide in me to transact this business for them and as it would be a real advantage to them to know the     truth of this report and how it is likely to affect them there needs no other apology for my taking the liberty of addressing to you this request in the hope that your lordship will condescend to do me the honor of writing a line on the subject by the next post to alexandria which will be acknowledged as a peculiar obligation conferred on my lord your lordships most obedient servant george washington   august      mt vernon matthew campbell to matthew campbell  mt vernon   august      sir in reply to your letter of the  th i think it a piece of justice due to you to acknowledge that i was not lead to inquire into the price of the goods i had purchased of you already and might hereafter take from anything that passed between us at the time i offered to discontinue my own importations upon condition i could get my goods at nearly what they would cost to import them myself i very well remember that nothing conclusive passed between you and me on that occasion as a proof of which i made out my own invoice and sent it home by captain jordan as usual consequently you were not restrained on that account from charging me what you pleased my inquiry arose from an opinion that i was dealing with you upon better terms than common and this opinion was founded upon what mr adam told me of his scheme when i came therefore to     see an article advanced a good deal higher than i expected i own to you that i was alarmed and thought it high time to know upon what footing i was purchasing if after this acknowledgment which i thought it incumbent on me to make in order that you might be released even from the apprehension of an engagement you still think proper to let me have the goods i may find occasion to buy in the country at    per cent sterling advance upon the genuine cost dischargeable at the current exchange i will confine my whole country dealings to your store and will endeavor to throw the wages which i pay to hirelings into your hands also provided you will let me know upon what certain reasonable advance they can have their goods upon the strength of my credit for unless they can deal with you upon better terms than with others i should not think myself justifiable in attempting to influence their choice and this knowledge i must come at in order that i may convince them if satisfied myself of the propriety of the measure you may believe me sincere when i assure you that no man wishes to see your company prosper in trade more than i do and self interest apart i have always thought the way to do this was to import largely and sell low provided you could get a ready vend and quick payments for your goods but do not deceive yourself by the ready despatch you have hitherto met with for though i do not pretend to dispute your selling at a low advance in general having had no opportunity at all of judging yet give     me leave to add that the progress you have hitherto met with is by no means an evident proof of it the mind of man is fond of novelty curiosity led many to your store and inclination when there tempted them to be doing to this they were excited by an opinion which most people had imbibed of your large importation and intended scheme of trade but my good sir this is but the work of a day and like the evening of it will sink into obscurity unless by a steady adherence to your plan you convince the judgment as well as satisfy the curiosity of your customers you see that i have used a freedom which friendship only can excuse me for if i did not wish well to your undertaking i should not take the liberty of troubling you with my sentiments which however different from your own or wrong in your principles are truely genuine george washington   november      lord dunmore to lord dunmore and council   november      my lord and

00  andrew lewis   00  peter hog   00          as the opening of the patents for these lands will put an end to the business of this tract of      so far as depends upon yr excellency and honrs i would beg leave to offer two points of material interest to some of the trustees to the serious consideration and determination of the board the first is as none of the patentees under the mode adopted of granting land to numbers in the same patent can be ascertained of their particular property therein till a legal division is established which as in the case of a late grant of       acres to sixty odd patentees is scarcely practicable to accomplish and of consequence the saving of the land by cultivation and improvement next to impossible by this means the intended bounty offered for a valuable consideration     is not only rendered void but to those who have contributed to the expense evidently injurious inasmuch as they have paid for that which it is not in their power to come at i say under these circumstances whether some expedient cannot be hit upon to serve those who are willing and desirous of complying with the theory of the grant either by prolonging the time of cultivation if this can be done or by directing each mans share in any patent to be laid off if the division is not effected by consent of parties within a certain limited period of which public notice to be given as each patentee thereafter shall respectively apply to the surveyor who may be instruced to lay off the same in one body and in a good figure to prevent injustice the second matter to be offered is whether something cannot and if it can ought not to be done compeling those who have never paid one farthing or taken one single step towards obtaining their lands not even the fees of office on their own particular tracts to contribute in proportion to the quantity of land they have and are to receive without something of this sort can be done previous to the patenting or in the patenting of these lands nothing is to be expected from them afterwards for where men i am speaking of those who hold principal shares in this grant for as to common soldiery little ever was expected from them are found so remiss after repeated exhortation as neither to afford time nor money for the purpose of conducting a work which could not possibly have gone without both little of     the latter is to be expected after the business is at an end and their patents delivered to them unless litigious lawsuits are commenced some of which against infants and some against persons beyond sea and without this i must after having been already saddled with almost the whole trouble and many expenses peculiar to myself submit to considerable loss as i have been obliged to advance all the fees of office and many drafts of the surveyor and considered i dare say by him as liable for his whole fees assured by having one in that case for the before mentioned tract of    00 acres patented to the common soldiery to pay for without i fear their being a penny the better of it as no step hath yet been taken to obtain a division one year of the three gone and onehalf of them may never more be heard of i have thus may it please yr excellency and honr endeavored to draw the whole of this matter into one short view to save you the trouble of referring from one order of council to another i have now to beg pardon for the trouble i have had occasion from time to time to give in prosecuting this matter and have the honor to be c      george washington    february      mount vernon colonel bassett to colonel bassett mount vernon    february      dear sir your favor of the  th came to my hands in course of post last thursday and filled us with no small concern at the indisposition of yourself and family     equally concerned am i to hear of the unhappy state of our paper currency and that the interposition of the assembly is thought necessary should this measure be resolved on be so good as to advise me whether it be intended that the country business generally shall be proceeded on or this alarming affair of the money only taken into consideration in the former case i shall come down in the latter as the session will be short and my business obliges me to the genl court i believe i shall decline it could there have been anything favorable said on the subject of corn i should not have neglected advising you of it till this time i have scarcely heard the name of corn mentioned since i left williamsburg and nothing can contribute more towards keeping down the price than the mildness of the winter hitherto having had no snow to cover the ground here yet and but little hard weather i have a few hundred barrels of my own to sell but have met with no offers for it as yet our celebrated fortune miss french whom half the world was in pursuit of bestowed her hand on wednesday last being her birthday you perceive i think myself under a necessity of accounting for the choice upon mr ben dulany who is to take her to maryland in a month from this time mentioning of one wedding puts me in mind of another tho of less dignity this is the marriage of mr henderson of colchester to a miss more of the same place remarkable for a very frizzled head and good singing     the latter of which i shall presume it was that captivated our merchant mrs washington patsy custis and jack who is now here are much as usual and the family not sicklier than common hoping this will find you perfectly restored and the rest of the good folks of eltham in better health than when you wrote last i am with best wishes to mrs bassett yourself and the children in which all here join george washington    february      mt vernon john dalton to captain john dalton mt vernon    february      sir i am obliged to you for the notice you have given me of an intended meeting of your vestry on tuesday next i do not know however that it will be in my power to attend nor do i conceive it at all necessary that i should as i am an avowed enemy to the scheme i have heard but never till of late believed that some members of your vestry are inclined to adopt if the subscription to which among others i put my name was set on foot under sanction of an order of vestry as i always understood it to be i own myself at a loss to conceive upon what principle it is that there should be an attempt to destroy it repugnant it is to every idea i entertain of justice to do so and the right of reclaiming the pews by the vestry in     behalf of the parish which have been built by private contribution granting the subscription money to be refunded with interest i most clearly deny therefore as a parishioner who is to be saddled with the extra charge of the subscription money i protest against the measure as a subscriber who meant to lay the foundation of a family pew in the new church i shall think myself injured for give me leave to ask can the raising of that £  0 under the present scheme be considered in any other light than that of a deception is it presumable that this money would have been advanced if the subscribers could possibly have conceived that after a solemn act of vestry under faith of which the money was subscribed the pews would be reclaimed surely not the thought is absurd and can be stated in no better point of view than this here is a parish wanting a large church but considering the circumstances of its constituents is content with a small one till an offer is made to enlarge it by subscription under certain privileges which is acceded by the vestry and when effected and the parish better able to bear a fresh tax what does it want why to destroy a solemn compact and reclaim the privileges they had granted for i look upon the refunding of money as totally beside the question and for what purpose i beg leave to ask is this to be done i own to you i am at a loss to discover for as every subscriber has an undoubted right to a seat in the church what matters it whether he assembles his     whole family into one pew or as the custom is have them dispersed into two or three and probably it is these families will increase in a proportionate degree with the rest of the parish so that if the vestry had a right to annul the agreement no disadvantage would probably happen on that account upon the whole sir as i observed to you before considering myself as a subscriber i enter my protest against the measure in agitation as a parishioner i am equally averse to a tax which is intended to replace the subscription money these will be my declared sentiments if present at the vestry if i am not i shall be obliged to you for communicating them george washington   th march      williamsburg dr thruston to rev dr thruston williamsburg   th march      revd sir your favor of the   th ulto by mr watson came duly to hand in answer to it i must beg leave to inform you that the short allotment of land to mr andw waggener was not the result of any determination of the officers who met at fredericksburg on the   d of novemr for they had nothing to do either in settling the proportions or distributing the land but was a solemn act of the governor and council on the sixth preceeding adopted after having a full state of the several advances laid before them and in my opinion upon the most just and equitable principles if mr waggener therefore is injurd     or thinks himself injured he must appeal to that board as the only tribunal which can afford him redress from your statement of the case however it would appear that you have been deceived by mr waggeners representation of this matter—he has been a culprit in respect to his contributions from the very beginning as thus—in august    0 a meeting of all the principal claimants was required in fredericksburg—accordingly mr waggener among others attended and exhibiting the nature of his claim was considered as the representative of his uncle thos waggener—an advance was then voted—his proportion calld for—but not paid till many months after— in march      another meeting of the claimants was summoned in winchester for by or before this time it is necessary to be remarked that our affairs never in a very promising way began to grow very alarming from the sollicitation of a large grant on the ohio by some of the most powerful men in england and by lord bottetourt notwithstanding the order of the council of the   th december     —expressly forbidding the surveys to go on at this meeting the few that attended maugre all the discouragements resolved as the only chance left to proceed at all hazards to surveying altho they were sensible that the expence would be great and would inevitably light on their own heads if it failed accordingly another sum was voted and mr waggener calld upon in an earnest and pressing manner     to advance his proportion—and what has he done why not paid one shilling of it to this hour so that it was not for his nonattendance at fredericksburg in november last where give me leave to add if other business was an excuse for this negligence no man could plead it with more propriety than myself having left all my business in williamsburg undone by reason of the late coming in of the merchants in order to be up there that he was curtailed of his land in the first distribution but for want of his money to make the surveys the effecting of which could not be done without whether this neglect proceeded from a disinclination to advance more under the circumstances as they then appeared—from disability or any other cause his own breast can best determine sufficient it is that he was calld upon on the  th of march      to make this deposit and that it is not done yet—the council seeing and having no reason to disbelieve these things not only as they respected mr waggener but all others under the like predicament thought it very just and reasonable that those who rather than give up their hopes had waded thro every difficulty and expence should be first considered and therefore determind without a dissenting voice that i have heard of that of the first surveys every one should receive in the proportion he had advanced being well satisfied that this work could not have gone on without money and that it never was expected nor could with propriety be expected that i who had had so much trouble in other respects was to ride about as a collector to     receive five pounds of this man ten pounds of that and so on it being sufficient for the parties to be apprized of their quotas and to whom to pay it to what i have here said i must take the liberty of observing further by way of explanation of my own meaning and the councils intention that my offer which you hint at had no allusion to an alteration of the kind you apply for—for the matter under contemplation at the time of inserting that saving clause was the quality of the soil it being supposed that the difference therein might cause an unequal division tho each man should obtain his quantum of land these sir are facts and but part of the reasons which governd in the determination of this matter under which you may judge how far mr waggener has just cause of complaint colo fry lt savage c have shared the same fate  captn stobo vanbraam  others who have contributed nothing have had no part of the lands already surveyd allowed them but left to come in at the second distribution when i dare say the govr  council will measure their justice by the same rule they observd upon the last occasion if the same causes prevail as they are left at large by the proclamation of      under which we derive our claim to divide the land in any manner they think proper—that mr wagener or the greatest delinquent of the whole shoud be now ready  willing to pay up their deficiencies  take a share of the patents i neither wonder at or doubt many men have objections to the purchase of lottery tickets in which light this grant of ours   0 to the most sanguine of us all has appeard that would be fond enough of partaking in the prizes but let it be asked would the delinquents have been ready  willing to have paid up their quotas if the scheme had fallen through as it most assuredly would have done if a few had not stood forth in support of the claim  where will be the answer it does not need the gift of prophecy to make it for if the money could not be got whilst there was the chance of a prize there woud be little hopes of receiving it in a case of a blank what kind of land may be included in the next surveys i cannot undertake to determine but should think it hard if the district allowd us never yet half explored shoud not be able to afford more than    000 acres of good land the quantity now patented i have rather exceeded the bounds of a letter by endeavoring to give you some idea of this matter after which i have only to repeat that i have no power to redress the complaint even if i had adjudged it reasonable which in truth i do not as i have declared upon this  shall do upon every other occasion when calld upon—notwithstanding i am informed—that you have been pleased to complain of the advantage which doctr craik  i why not colo fry  colo mercer also have reaped in a distinct allotment the reasons of which i endeavord in as clear  distinct a manner as i could to account for and as far as i was concernd in the distinction if it is considered in this light with openness  candour with what propriety am i accused then did it matter anything     whether doctr craik mr west or mr polson was left out of the large survey so far as the general end respecting quantity was answered by it and if it did not was there any person better entitled to the indulgence than the doctor considered in every point of view i think not and admitting that by fixing my lott in this survey  turning others out the amount of the claims had corrisponded as nearly as now with the quantity of the survey was there any reason for doing of it if not why shoud it have happened— i did not on the one hand pick the surveys that were assigned me either from the excellency of the land or convenience of situation if i had i should have avoided the largest tract i now have composing a full moiety of my quantum as every inch of it from the surveyors account is subject to be overflowed—nor did i on the other object to the fifty thousand on account of the land for if i had my choice of the whole country i should have fixed in this survey but because i thought after the land became patented if any additional trouble was to be encounterd from the strange manner of granting it it might as well fall upon others as me as my shoulders had supported the whole weight heretofore and in as much as i might add without much arrogance that if it had not been for my unremitted attention to every favorable circumstance not a singe acre of land would ever have been obtained     george washington    march      james wood to james wood     march      dear sir herewith you will receive lord dunmores certificates of my claims as well in my own right as by purchase from captain posey and mr thruston in the location of which in the government of west florida i shall rely on your friendship and care unnecessary it is to add that i should choose good land or none at all but as many things concur to make land valuable it is impossible for me at this distance and under my present knowledge of that country to be explicit in any direction suffice it then to observe generally that i would greatly prefer the land upon the river to lands back from it that i should not like to be in a low morassy country nor yet in that which is hilly and broken and that from the idea i entertain of that country at this time i should like to be as high up the mississippi as the navigation is good having been informed that the lands are better and the climate more temperate in the northern parts of the government than below if i could get the lands equally good in one survey i should prefer it if not then in one or more as circumstances require perhaps some locations already made upon the river might for a small consideration be bought if so i would rather advance a little money than put with less valuable land you will please to have the grant surveyed and effectually secured with such indulgences as those claiming     under the proclamation of      are entitled to and do all and every thing in my behalf which shall to you seem right and proper the cost of doing which i will pay and moreover for your faithful discharge of this trust allow you the sum of one hundred pounds virginia currency on the due execution of it wishing you a pleasant tour and safe return to your friends  george washington  0 march      mt vernon james wood to james wood mt vernon  0 march      dear sir i intended to have had a little further conversation with you on the subject of the florida lands but my haste to leave williamsburg and your dining out the day i did do so prevented it i addressed a short letter to you by way of memorandum and left it with mr southall i hope you received it that i may     be satisfied you did so please to advise me as the governors certificates of my claim were inclosed therein these certificates will be sufficient authority for the governor of west florida to warrant the surveys and if any scruple is entertained of my purchases from mr thruston and captain posey i shall remove it by transmitting their bonds which should have accompanied this letter could i have been assured of its reaching your hands before your departure you will readily perceive by the tenor of my last that it is good land or none i am now in pursuit of and that i could wish to have it procured in such a part of the country as from your own observation aided by information you shall judge most valuable although in accomplishing of it i pay a little more for these reasons it is i avoid particular directions i shall place a generous confidence in your integrity having no doubt either of your ability or inclination to serve me by meeting with mr gist and others of your old acquaintances you will have it in your power of forming from their accounts a pretty general and perhaps just idea of the nature of the country and of determining by your own observations on them whether the lands on the mississippi the mobile or elsewhere promise in futuro to become most valuable not till after which i would recommend it to you to fix on your locations doctor connolly is curious in his observations and sensible in his remarks to him therefore i have wrote as he has been pleased to solicit my correspondence requesting     his assistance to you i have also taken the liberty of writing to the governor of west florida expressing my hopes of obtaining this land and more in case you should think proper to locate it in that government agreeable to the tenor of his majestys proclamation mentioning at the same time your intended tour and the discretionary power i had vested you with and as lord dunmore promised me that he would give you an introduction to him i hope you received it it would appear to me from the words of his majestys proclamation of october      that those who obtain land under it are not only entitled to an exemption of quit rents for ten years but exempt also from cultivation and improvement for the same term of this latter however please to be informed from the best authority as in the event of it i should be strongly inclined to extend my views beyond the quantity i here claim especially as the time allowed for doing it is not short and difficult to be complied with this therefore is a matter i would beg leave to refer to your consideration requesting in case you find the country from a comparative view of it desirable good lands easy to be obtained and not difficult to keep under the established rules of government that you would increase my quantity to fifteen twenty or twentyfive thousand acres in short i could wish to have as much good land located in a body or contiguous together for the convenience of the superintendence as i could save without much difficulty or expence even if the first ten thousand     should be subject to the same laws of cultivation with the last various are the reports concerning the quit rents and purchase money of these lands but it appears evident to me from the strict sense and letter of the proclamation that the governor has no right to exact more than is demanded in virginia or any other of his majestys colonies in none of which i believe nore than two shillings sterling rent and ten shillings right money are required    george washington   april      mount vernon benedict calvert to benedict calvert mount vernon   april      dear sir i am now set down to write to you on a subject of importance and of no small embarrassment to me my soninlaw and ward mr custis has as i have been informed paid his addresses to your second daughter and having made some progress in her affections has solicited her in marriage how far a union of this sort may be agreeable to you you best can tell but i should think myself wanting in candor were i not to confess that miss nellies amiable qualities are acknowledged on all hands and that an alliance with your family will be pleasing to his this acknowledgment being made you must permit me to add sir that at this or in any short time his youth inexperience and unripened education are and will be insuperable obstacles in my opinion to the completion of the marriage as his guardian     i conceive it my indispensable duty to endeavor to carry him through a regular course of education many branches of which i am sorry to add he is totally deficient in and to guard his youth to a more advanced age before an event on which his own peace and the happiness of another are to depend takes place not that i have any doubt of the warmth of his affections nor i hope i may add any fears of a change in them but at present i do not conceive that he is capable of bestowing that attention to the important consequences of the married state which is necessary to be given by those who are about to enter into it and of course i am unwilling he should do it till he is if the affection which they have avowed for each other is fixed upon a solid basis it will receive no diminution in the course of two or three years in which time he may prosecute his studies and thereby render himself more deserving of the lady and useful to society if unfortunately as they are both young there should be an abatement of affection on either side or both it had better precede than follow marriage delivering my sentiments thus freely will not i hope lead you into a belief that i am desirous of breaking off the match to postpone it is all i have in view for i shall recommend to the young gentleman with the warmth that becomes a man of honor notwithstanding he did not vouchsafe to consult either his mother or me on the occasion to consider himself as much engaged to your daughter as if the indissoluble knot were tied and as the surest means     of effecting this to apply himself closely to his studies and in this advice i flatter myself you will join me by which he will in a great measure avoid those little flirtations with other young ladies that may by dividing the attention contribute not a little to divide the affection it may be expected of me perhaps to say something of property but to descend to particulars at this time must seem rather premature in general therefore i shall inform you that mr custiss estate consists of about fifteen thousand acres of land a good part of it adjoining the city of williamsburg and none of it forty miles from that place several lots in the said city between two and three hundred negroes and about eight or ten thousand pounds upon bond and in the hands of his merchants this estate he now holds independent of his mothers dower which will be an addition to it at her death and upon the whole it is such an estate as you will readily acknowledge ought to entitle him to a handsome portion with a wife but as i should never require a child of my own to make a sacrifice of himself to interest so neither do i think it incumbent on me to recommend it as a guardian at all times when you mrs calvert or the young ladies can make it convenient to favor us with a visit we should be happy in seeing you at this place mrs washington and miss custis join me in respectful compliments and i am dear sir your most obedient servant     george washington    april      mount vernon lord dunmore to lord dunmore governor of virginia mount vernon    april      my lord in obedience to your lordships request i do myself the honor to inform you that by letters this day received from dr cooper of kings college in new york i find it will be about the first of next month before i shall set off for that place and that it will perhaps be the middle of june before i return harvest then coming on and seldom ending till after the middle of july i could almost wish to see it accomplished but if the delay in doing it is attended with any kind of inconvenience to your lordship i will at all events be ready by the first of july to accompany you through any and every part of the western country which you may think proper to visit i beg the favor of your lordship to inform me therefore as nearly as you can of the precise time you will do me the honor of calling here that i may get ready accordingly and give notice of it to mr crawford if your lordship purposes to take the route of pittsburg whom i took the liberty of recommending as a good woodsman and well acquainted with the lands in that quarter that he may be disengaged when we get to his house which is directly on that communication i am persuaded that such a person will be found very necessary in an excursion of this sort from his superior knowledge of the country and of the inhabitants who are thinly scattered over it   0 no person can be better acquainted with the equipage and simple conveniences necessary in an undertaking of this sort than your lordship and therefore it would be impertinent in me to mention them but if your lordship should find it convenient to have any thing provided in this part of the country and will please to honor me with your commands they shall be punctually obeyed as also if your lordship chooses to have an indian engaged i will write to colonel croghan deputy indian agent who lives near pittsburg to have one provided the design of my journey to new york is to take my soninlaw mr custis to kings college if your lordship therefore has any letters or commands either to that place or philadelphia i shall think myself honored in being the bearer of them as well as benefited by means of the introduction i am c george washington    april      mount vernon colonel bassett to colonel bassett mount vernon    april      dear sir the interruption of the post for several weeks prevented our receiving the melancholy account of your loss until within these few days that we sympathize in the misfortune and lament the decree which has deprived you of so dutiful a child and the world of so promising a young lady stands in no need i hope of argument to prove but the ways of providence being inscrutable and the justice of it not to be scanned by the shallow eye of humanity     nor to be counteracted by the utmost efforts of human power or wisdom resignation and as far as the strength of our reason and religion can carry us a cheerful acquiescence to the divine will is what we are to aim and i am persuaded that your own good sense will arm you with fortitude to withstand the stroke great as it is and enable you to console mrs bassett whose loss and feelings are much to be pitied by letters from doctr cooper president of the college in new york my departure for that place is now fixed to about the  th of may which puts it out of my power to attend the meeting in williamsburg this court i have therefore by mr henderson inclosed several letters to and drafts upon different people for money to col fielding lewis who wrote me that he should be in williamsburg but if sickness or any other unforeseen accident should prevent his attendance i should take it very kind of you to ask for and open my letter to him and comply with the contents in respect to the receiving and paying of money mrs washington in her letter to mrs bassett informs her of jack custiss engagement with nelly calvert second daughter of benedict calvert esq of maryland i shall say nothing further therefore on the subject than that i could have wished he had postponed entering into that engagement till his studies were finished not that i have any objection to the match as she is a girl of exceeding good character but because i fear as he has discovered much     fickleness already that he may either change and therefore injure the young lady or that it may precipitate him into a marriage before i am certain he has ever bestowed a serious thought of the consequences by which means his education is interrupted and he perhaps wishing to be at liberty again before he is fairly

conceive than to describe the distress of this family especially that of the unhappy parent of our dear patsy custis when i inform you that yesterday removed the sweet innocent girl entered into a more happy  peaceful     abode than any she has met with in the afflicted path she hitherto has trod  she rose from dinner about four oclock in better health and spirits than she appeared to have been in for some time soon after which she was seized with one of her usual fits  expired in it in less than two minutes without uttering a word a groan or scarce a sigh—this sudden and unexpected blow i scarce need add has almost reduced my poor wife to the lowest ebb of misery which is encreasd by the absence of her son whom i have just fixed at the college in new york from whence i returned the  th inst and want of the balmy consolation of her relations which leads me more than ever to wish she could see them and that i was master of arguments powerful enough to prevail upon mrs dandridge to make this place her entire  absolute home i should think as she lives a lonesome life betsey being married it might suit her well  be agreeable both to herself  my wife to me most assuredly it would i do not purpose to add more at present the end of my writing being only to inform you of this unhappy change— our sincere affections are offered to mrs bassett mrs dandridge  all other friends  i am very sincerely     advertisement of the ohio lands  mount vernon in virginia july         the subscriber having obtained patents for upwards of twenty thousand acres of land on the ohio and great kanhawa ten thousand of which are situated on the banks of the firstmentioned river between the mouths of the two kanhawas and the remainder on the great kanhawa or new river from the mouth or near it upwards in one continued survey proposes to divide the same into any sized tenements that may be desired and lease them upon moderate terms allowing a reasonable number of years rent free provided within the space of two years from next october three acres for every fifty contained in each lot and proportionably for a lesser quantity shall be cleared fenced and tilled and that by or before the time limited for the commencement of the first rent five acres for every hundred and proportionably as above shall be enclosed and laid down in good grass for meadow and moreover that at least fifty good fruit trees for every like quantity of land shall be planted on the premises any persons inclinable to settle on these lands may be more fully informed of the terms by applying to the subscriber near alexandria or in his absence to mr lund washington and would do well in communicating their intentions before the  st of october next in order that a sufficient number of lots may be laid off to answer the demand as these lands are among the first which have been surveyed in the part of the country they lie in it is almost needless to premise that none can exceed them in luxuriance of soil or convenience of situation all of them lying upon the banks either of the ohio or kanhawa and abounding with fine fish and wild fowl of various kinds as also in most excellent meadows many of which by the bountiful hand of nature are in their present state almost fit for the scythe from every part of these lands water carriage is now had to fort pitt by an easy communication and from fort pitt up the monongahela to redstone vessels of convenient     burthen may and do pass continually from whence by means of cheat river and other navigable branches of the monongahela it is thought the portage to potowmack may and will be reduced within the compass of a few miles to the great ease and convenience of the settlers in transporting the produce of their lands to market to which may be added that as patents have now actually passed the seals for the several tracts here offered to be leased settlers on them may cultivate and enjoy the lands in peace and safety notwithstanding the unsettled counsels respecting a new colony on the ohio and as no right money is to be paid for these lands and quitrent of two shillings sterling a hundred demandable some years hence only it is highly presumable that they will always be held upon a more desirable footing than where both these are laid on with a very heavy hand and it may not be amiss further to observe that if the scheme for establishing a new government on the ohio in the manner talked of should ever be effected these must be among the most valuable lands in it not only on account of the goodness of soil and the other advantages above enumerated but from their contiguity to the seat of government which more than probable will be fixed at the mouth of the great kanhawa george washington      george washington    september      mount vernon willliam crawford to willliam crawford mount vernon    september      dear sir i have heard the truth of which if you saw lord dunmore in his way to or from pittsburg you possibly are better acquainted with than i am that his lordship will grant patents for lands lying below the scioto to the officers and soldiers who claim under the proclamation of october      if so i think no time should be lost in having them surveyed lest some new revolution should happen in our political system i have therefore by this conveyance written to captain bullet to desire he will have ten thousand acres surveyed for me five thousand of     which i am entitled to in my own right the other five thousand by purchase from a captain and lieutenant i have desired him to get this quantity of land in one tract if to be had of the first quality if not then in two or even in three agreeably to the several rights under which i hold rather than survey bad land for me or even that which is middling i have also desired him to get it as near the mouth of the scioto that is to the western bounds of the new colony as may be but for the sake of better lands i would go quite down to the falls or even below meaning thereby to get richer and wider bottoms as it is my desire to have my lands run out upon the banks of the ohio if you should go down the river this fall in order to look out your own quantity under the proclamation i shall be much obliged to you for your assistance to captain bullet in getting these ten thousand acres for me of the most valuable land you can and i will endeavor to make you ample amends for your trouble but i by no means wish or desire you to go down on my account unless you find it expedient on your own of this i have written to captain bullet under cover to you desiring if you should be with him that he will ask your assistance as i have understood that captain thompson by what authority i know not has been surveying a good deal of land for the pennsylvania officers and that dr connolly has a promise from our governor of two thousand acres at the falls i have desired   0 captain bullet by no means to involve me in disputes with any person who has an equal claim to land with myself under the proclamation of      as to the pretensions of other people it is not very essential as i am told that the governor has declared he will grant patents to none but the officers and soldiers who are comprehended within the proclamation aforementioned but even of these claims if i could get lands equally as good as convenient and as valuable in every respect elsewhere i should choose to steer clear  old david wilper who was an officer in our regiment and has been with bullet running out land for himself and others tells me that they have already discovered salt springs in that country three of     which captain thompson has included within some surveys he has made and the other an exceedingly valuable one upon the river kentucky is in some kind of dispute i wish i could establish one of my surveys there i would immediately turn it to an extensive public benefit as well as private advantage however as four are already discovered it is more than probable there are many others and if you could come at the knowledge of them by means of the indians or otherwise i would join you in taking them up in the name or names of some persons who have a right under the proclamation and whose right we can be sure of buying as it seems there is no other method of having lands granted but this should be done with a good deal of circumspection and caution till patents are obtained i did not choose to forego the opportunity of writing to you by the gentlemen who are going to divide their land at the mouth of the great kenhawa though i could wish to have delayed it till i could hear from the governor to whom i have written to know certainly whether he will grant patents for the land which captain bullet is surveying that one may proceed with safety as also whether a discretionary power which i had given mr wood to select my land in west florida under an information even from his lordship himself that lands could not be had here would be any bar to my surveying on the ohio especially as i have heard since mr woods departure that all the lands on that part of the mississippi to which he was restricted by me are already     engaged by the emigrants who have resorted to that country should i however receive any discouraging account from his lordship on these heads i shall embrace the first opportunity that offers afterwards to acquaint you with it by mr lëet i informed you of the unhappy cause which prevented my going out this fall but i hope nothing will prevent my seeing you in that country in the spring the precise time as yet it is not in my power to fix but i should be glad if you would let me know how soon it may be attended with safety ease and comfort after which i will fix upon a time to be at your house i am in the mean while with sincere good wishes for you mrs crawford and family your friend c george washington   th septemr      mount vernon michael cresap to michael cresap mount vernon   th septemr      sir in my passage down the ohio in the fall of the year    0 i made choice of a piece of land being the first bottom on the so east side the river above capteening as also a little above a place where the effects of a hurricane appear among the trees and opposite to a creek on the other side near the upper end of the bottom calld pipe creek  the next spring when capt crawford went down the ohio to survey i desired him to run out this land for me which he accordingly did  returned me the plat of     it as you may see by the inclosed copy intending as soon as a patent could be obtained to apply for me the summer following hearing that doctor brisco had taken possession of this bottom altho informd of my claim to it i wrote him a letter of which the inclosd is a copy—and within these few days i have heard the truth of which i know not that you upon the doctors quitting of it have also taken possession of it if this information be true i own i can conceive no reason why you or any other person should attempt to disturb me in my claim to this land as i have not to my knowledge injurd or attempted to injure any other man in his pretensions to land in that country it is a little hard therefore upon me that i cannot be allowed to hold this bottom which is but a small one in peace and quietness till a legal right can be obtained which i always have been and still am ready to pay for as soon as i know to what office to apply—i would feign hope that my information respecting your taking possession of this land is without foundation as i should be sorry to enter into a litigation of this matter with you or any other gentleman but as i conceivd that i had as good a right to make choice of this bottom as any other person has as i am sure that i am the first that did so and have had it surveyd so as to ascertain the bounds upwards of two years ago i am resolved not to relinquish my claim to it—but if you have made any improvements thereon not knowing of my claim i will very readily pay you the full value thereof being etc     george washington  0 october      mount vernon john armstrong to colonel armstrong mount vernon  0 october      dear sir upon my return home from the annapolis races from whence i wrote you committing the letter to the care of capt mcgachen of baltimore town who assured me it should be forwarded the week after i received a letter from lord dunmore our governor containing the following paragraph which i enclose for your information agreeable to my promise i last post received yours of the   th inst  that is september wherein you beg to be informed whether i propose granting patents to such officers and soldiers as claim under his majestys proclamation in  ber      i do not mean to grant any patents on the western waters as i do not think i am at present impowered so to do i did indeed tell a poor old german lieutenant who was with me  and informed me he was very poor and had ten children that i possibly might grant him a patent contiguous to that which he had under mr dinwiddies proclamation which i suppose is what may have given rise to the report you have heard i was suspicious as i think i wrote you in my last that the report of lord dunmores granting patents was rather premature for after declaring to the officers of his own government that he did not conceive himself at liberty to issue patents for lands on the western waters i could scarce think he would change his opinion without giving them some intimation of it either in a publick or private manner and yet there are some words in his letter which i have     marked which seem to imply an expectation at least of doing it it remains therefore to be considered whether the officers claiming under his majestys proclamation of      have a better chance of securing their lands elsewhere and if they have not whether the known equity of their claims the prevailing opinion that bullet is proceeding by authority in the surveys he is now making and the united endeavors of the officers to obtain patents for the lands actually surveyed may not discourage other emigrants from settling thereon and in the end induce government to comply with their just requisitions by fulfilling its own voluntary promises i own it is a kind of lottery and whether the chance of a prize is not worth the expense of a survey is the point in question as subjects and individuals of the community at large we are at least upon a par with those who are occupying the country but whether any of these pleas under the present discouragements of government will avail anything is a mere matter of speculation on which every person must exercise his own powers of reflection george washington   november      williamsburg lord dunmore to lord dunmore williamsburg   november      my lord urged by repeated applications from a number of officers whom i have had the honor to command in the service of this colony i take the liberty of addressing your excellency on the subject of the lands     which the gentlemen conceive themselves entitled to under his majestys bounty of october      the exception in favor of the officers and soldiers contained in his majestys order in council  of the  th of april last they humbly conceive is so strong an implication of your lordships right to grant them these lands as to remove every restraint you were under before and as there are no waste lands to be had in this colony but such as lie upon the western waters they humbly pray for leave to survey on the river ohio and its waters below the mouth of scioto the western boundary of the new colony should it ever take place apprehending that your excellency has an undoubted right to grant patents for these lands since they have ever been considered as appertaining to virginia warranted as they have been informed by the colony charter and sold by the six nations at the treaty of fort stanwix in      nor is the right thereto it is humbly presumed by any means diminished by the nominal line commonly called the ministerial line since that transaction seems to have been considered by government as a temporary expedient at the instigation of the indian agent to satisfy the southern indians who as it is said have disclaimed any right to the very lands in contest and no further regard has been paid to it by the ministers themselves the officers of the virginia troops impressed with these sentiments and having undoubted reason to     believe that there is no other chance left them to obtain their lands but on the ohio and knowing at the same time that the officers of pennsylvania under a belief that these lands appertain to virginia and that patents will be granted for them have surveyed two hundred thousand acres—would fain hope that they may be allowed to proceed by authority to make their surveys also anywhere upon the ohio or its waters below the scioto humbly representing to your lordship that a delay in this case is in effect equal to a refusal as the country is becoming spread over with emigrants and experience has convinced all those who have had occasion to attend to the matter that these people when once fixed are not to be dispossessed were it politic to attempt it the officers have an entire confidence in your lordships disposition to promote their just rights they have no other dependence and they hope to be put on an equal footing with those other officers whose pretensions are not better founded than their own the part i take in bringing this matter to a hearing will i hope meet with your lordships excuse as i am with the greatest respect my lord your lordships most obedient and most humble servant           george washington   th jany—     mount vernon william black to william black mount vernon—  th jany—     sir i was not a little surprized when informed by your own letter as well as from mr hills of mrs blacks having refused to acknowledge her right of dower in the lands i bought of you did you not repeatedly assure me that she was ready at all times to relinquish her right and did she not signify as much to me herself as i brought her from williamsburg to colo bassetts from whence then does this sudden change proceed is it because i placed more confidence than i ought  to make things agreeable to you  convenient to your creditors paid the money in williamsburg when i was not obliged to do it till the title was effectually secured  had till the   th of decr to do this in a generous mind would recoil at such a thought  yet what other construction can i put upon this change you say i tell her she only wants the customary compliment for my own part i know of no compliment established by custom i have bought many pieces of     land before these and never had a demand of the kind nor can i harbor so unfavorable an opinion of mrs black as to think she is influenced by so low and pitiful a consideration however if i misjudge the matter and the custom is as you say you must have complyd with it yourself whatever therefore you have given to others for these very lands i will tho i think myself under no obligation to do it give to mrs black which will remove that objection—but if i was surprized at this refusal of mrs blacks how much more so ought i to be at your attempting according to mr hills account to withhold the mills which is solely an act of your own under what pretext is this done do you not remember that by our agreement you were to deliver possession of the plantations mills and every thing thereunto belonging immediately after the   th of decemr  that you are bound to do this in a bond of £  000— but this bond you tell me must be given up to you before you can surrender possession of the premises when one of the express conditions of it is to enforce a compliance is not your request therefore a very reasonable  proper one to convince you that it is so i enclose you a copy of the bond as you certainly have forgot it accompanied with this assurance that i shall hold fast the original till you have complyed with the conditions of it after which as it is not intended nor can have any further operation it is a matter of moonshine in whose hands it is lodged or what becomes of it  00 thus much respecting the dower  detainer in general i shall observe further to you that though it never was my intention or desire to hasten mrs black out of the house whilst the weather continued unfavorable yet when you applyed for this  some other indulgences did i not always tell you that i thought myself under no obligation to enter into a second contract on this head and did i not moreover refuse to sign an instrument of writing which you had drawn declaratory of your wants because i chose to be governd by circumstances  the future conduct of your people not that i had any objection as i dare say i might tell you to your negroes staying on the plantations to finish your crops  take care of your stock provided there was room for my people  yours behaved themselves well neither disturbing of us in our operations nor committing of waste so in like manner respecting the vessell—but these being applyd for as matters of indulgence after you had enterd into a solemn contract to deliver up the whole on or before the   th of december whence comes it that after having fulfilled every tittle of the contract on my part you should conceive yourself at liberty to withhold the mills  talk of not delivering up possession till i should first surrender a bond whch is the only security i have for your doing of it and for indemnifying me against mrs blacks claim after i have paid every farthing of the purchase money— is there honor justice or equity in such kind of proceedings no sir there is not  to cut the  0  matter short i have directed mr hill to wait upon you  before evidences to demand immediate possession of the two mills—to view  note down before the same evidences the order  condition of the houses c occupied by you and your people—to require you to hasten the finishing of your crops that all your people except such as are necessary for the care of your stock may be transported—and lastly that you may remove yourself  family as soon as the weather will permit mrs black to go with convenience that my people may have the free  uninterrupted management of the whole purchased premises—and to this i have to add by way of hint to you that whatever accident or damage comes to the mills milldams or any house houses or other things in your occupation i shall look to you for full  ample reparation for the same as i also do for the profits of the mill till surrenderd which can easily be ascertained by your own advertisements—it was far from my expectation  much further from my desire to enter into a litigation of those points but i shall conceive it a duty incumbent on me to assert a just right and to see that the bargain which we have made is reciprocally complied with— i do not incline to take any part of your household furniture—the fixtures appurtaining to the houses i expect will remain entire—but if mr hill should choose i do not know that he does to take any part or all of your stocks  you  he can agree upon the terms he has my consent—but as to the negro miller  wife i shall not interfere in the  0  purchase of them for if mr hill should like the negroes  price i suppose he will buy them but if he does not he would be to blame to do it p s the bond from col byrds trustees to me i have by this opportunity sent to mr wythe from whom you can get it so soon as he thinks it ought to be given up—the other may also be surrenderd so soon as you have complyd with the conditions of it george washington    feby      mount vernon colonel bassett to colonel bassett mount vernon    feby      dear sir i find there will go some matters from this country which will make my attendance at the assembly necessary this i cannot possibly do and go over the mountains this spring i have therefore determined much against my inclination  interest to postpone my trip to the ohio till after harvest as i cannot well be absent from home at that season as march therefore at least the first of it is a disagreeable season to travel our roads in and as i am obliged illegible to run land about the  0th of the month of march and from thence proceed into frederick and berkeley i hope it will be agreeable and convenient to mrs bassett and you to give us the pleasure of seeing you here after that time the roads and weather will be then good our fisheries will be then come on and i think you will have more satisfaction than in an earlier visit the letter herewith inclosed for mr dandridge  0  contains blacks bond which mr wythe has advised me to lodge in some safe hands to be tendered to that pritty gentleman upon his complying with the conditions of it as the care of it is a thing of the utmost importance i should be obliged to you if captn crawford should not go to mr dandridges himself to send the letter by abram or some careful person least the bond should get lost as i am very much hurried just now by business of different kinds and as i presume my wife has informed mrs bassett of jacks marriage and all the other little occurrences she can think of i shall only request you to make my affecte complements to her and the rest of the family and believe me to be with great truth  george washington    february      mount vernon henry riddell to henry riddell mount vernon    february      sir mr young hearing me express a desire of importing palatines to settle on my lands on the ohio tells  0  me that in discoursing of this matter in your company you suggested an expedient which might probably be attended with success and that if i inclined to adopt it you wished to be informed before the sailing of your ship the desire of seating and improving my lands on the ohio is founded on interested as well as political views but the intention of importing palatines for the purpose was more the effect of sudden thought than mature consideration because i am totally unacquainted with the manner as well as the expense of doing it and i was led into the notion principally from a report of either this or some other ship of yours being blamed for not taking an offered freight of these germans at forty shillings sterling i was thus induced to think if this charge was not much accumulated by other expenses that i could fall on no better expedient to settle my lands with industrious people than by such an importation the terms upon which i have thought of importing palatines or people from ireland or scotland are these to import them at my expense where they are unable to transport themselves into the potomac river and from hence to the ohio to have them in the first case engaged to me under indenture in the second by some other contract equally valid to become tenants upon the terms hereafter mentioned as without these securities i would not encounter the expense trouble and hazard of such an importation but to make matters as easy and agreeable as possible to these emigrants i will engage on my part  0  that the indentures shall be considered in no other light than as a security for reimbursing to me every expense i am under with interest in importing them removing them to the land and supporting them there till they can raise a crop for their own subsistence giving up the said indentures and considering them altogether as freemen and tenants so soon as this shall happen not to each person or family respectively but when the whole accumulated expense shall be discharged as i must for my own safety consider them as jointly bound for this payment till the expiration of the indented terms otherwise i must be an inevitable loser by every death or other accident whilst they cannot in the worst light be considered as more than servants at large during the indented term i can also engage to set them down upon as good land as any in that country and where there is neither house built nor land cleared i will allow them an exemption of rent four years and where there is a house erected and five acres of land cleared and fit for cultivation two years they shall have the land upon lease for twentyone years under the usual covenants and also at an annual rent after the first becomes due of four pounds sterling for each hundred acres allowing each family to take more or less as inclination and convenience may prompt and i will moreover engage to renew the leases at the expiration of the above twentyone years and in like manner at the end of every seven years afterwards upon an increased rent to be agreed on between the landlord and tenant or in  0  order to fix the matter absolutely if this should be more agreeable the rent may be increased at these periods in proportion to the increased value of that or the adjoining lands possessed of equal advantages of soil and situation these are the terms on which i thought to import and plant people on my ohio lands which are for the quantity equal if not superior to any in that country situate altogether upon the ohio or great kenhawa two fine inland navigable rivers abounding in fish and wild fowl of all sorts as the lands do in wild meats of the best kind from alexandria to the navigable waters of the ohio along a much frequented road used by wagons is according to the computed distance two hundred miles this landcarriage if the inland navigation of the potomac should be effected than which i think nothing easier will be reduced to sixty miles as matters now stand some say to forty and others to twenty but call it the greatest distance any commodity made upon any part of these lands of mine may be transported along a very easy watercommunication to the settlement of redstone where the landcarriage at this time begins to say nothing therefore of the advantages of raising stock of all kinds and horses which will carry themselves to market and are now and will from the nature of things continue to be in great demand in the interior parts of this great continent hemp flax potashes indigo and the like will well afford the expense of this landcarriage admitting it never may be reduced  0  and can be cultivated to advantage on the river bottoms in that country having thus exhibited a general view of my design i shall now be obliged to you sir to inform me with as much precision as you can what certainty there is that your ship will go to holland what probability there is of her getting palatines if she does go when they may be expected in this country what would be the freight and as near as you can judge the whole incidental expense attending each person delivered at alexandria and moreover whether it would be expected that the whole of these charges including freight should be paid down immediately on the arrival of the ship here as it must appear rather hard to make a certain provision for an uncertain event it may not be amiss further to observe that i see no prospect of these people being restrained in the smallest degree either in their civil or religious principles which i take notice of because these are privileges which mankind are solicitous to enjoy and upon which emigrants must be anxious to be informed i wrote to philadelphia by the last post for full information of the manner and charge of importing these people from holland  and if your account in answer to this letter should prove agreeable to my  0  wishes i will send a more particular description of the lands which i wish to settle as well as copies of the plots and do any other matter which may be judged necessary to further the design i am c george washington  th may      mount

heard of has offered since this letter taking the chance of conveyance from place to place only—  0  immediately upon the receipt of your favor by mr young i despatched a letter to capt crawford covering yours to him pointing out the necessity of his attempting to qualify as your deputy at your court for april before this i did not urge him as he appeared anxious to return home to take that rout for two reasons—in the first place i did not advert to the necessity of this qualification in the next place till your letter arrived which was after he was gone i did not know whether you would accept of him as an assistant or not—at the same time i wrote to him i forwarded letters under his cover in order to be deliverd by him to mr madison mr jones and capt hog requesting the favor of each to facilitate his business if he came in on this errand but what has been the result of all this i know not never having heard a syllable from him since— i come now to take notice of what you have said in respect to mr michael cresap whose claim to the round bottom and other lands along the banks of the ohio for as i am credibly informed thirty miles is equally well founded and founded upon no other right or pretence than that of claiming every good bottom upon the river building a cabbin thereon to keep off others and then selling them and going on to possess other lands in the same manner—this if common report tells truth is the foundation of mr cresaps claim to the round bottom set up long after i had made choice of it and had had it surveyd as a stage or lodgment between fort pitt  my lands on the great kenhawa—it is true as this   0 is esteemd a valuable bottom he may have taken more pains in the improvement of it than of the others but his choice or even knowledge of it was long after i had had it surveyd this being the amount of his claim i will now give you the substance of mine which cannot be better done than by informing you that in the fall of the year    0 when i went to view the lands which have been since surveyed under the proclamation of      i made choice of this spot of land called the round bottom marked trees  directed captn crawford when he went down the spring following to survey it which he accordingly did as may appear by his certificate inclosed you by mr young sometime after this hearing that doctor brisco had taken possession of it  actually had or was going to fix negroes on it i wrote him a letter of which no   is a copy upon which i was informed he had quit it sometime after this again i learned that mr michael cresap had taken possession of it built houses and was working hands thereon upon which i also wrote him a letter of which no   is the copy and was given to understand that mr theobald or tibbles as he is commonly called who was partner with mr cresap in this land was determined to give it up receiving at the same time a message by capt crawford from mr michael cresap that if i would let him have the land he would pay me what i thought the worth of it to which i returned for answer that as it was the only piece of land i had upon the ohio between fort pitt and the kenhawas and found it     very necessary as a stage or lodgment in coming up the river i could not agree to part with it but again offered to pay for any labor or improvement which he had made in this situation things were when i wrote to you by mr young—otherwise if i had thought that mr cresap could with any color of justice or even at any rate as he must be conscious that the mode he has praticed of engrossing  selling lands i should have mentiond it to you before but in truth from every thing that has passed i concluded that he had yielded to my prior claim—in like manner may my title to the three thousand acres on the waters of sharter  racoon be disputed for after that also was surveyed for me after i had bought the rights or claims rather of several people to it  after i had actually built several houses thereon by way of strengthening my right numbers of people went in a forcible manner and in defiance of repeated notices  took possession of the land  built cabbins in such a manner as to prevent even entrance into my houses  may as mr cresap has dispute my title under pretence of having improved it—but i do not expect that such claims as these can ever have an operation to my prejudice or ought to retard my patent however i do not wish to hasten any measure faster than it can be done with propriety—      session of the house of burgesses         may   set off for mr calverts dined and lodged

vernon   july      dear sir john has just delivered to me your favor of yesterday which i shall be obliged to answer in a more concise manner than i could wish as i am very much engaged in raising one of the additions to my house which i think perhaps it is fancy goes on better whilst i am present than in my absence from the workmen i own to you sir i wished much to hear of your making an open declaration of taking a poll for this county upon colonel wests publicly declining last sunday and i should have written to you on the subject but for information then received from several gentlemen in the churchyard of your having refused to do so for the reasons assigned in your letter      upon which as i think the country never stood more in need of men of abilities and liberal sentiments than now i entreated several gentlemen at our church yesterday to press colonel mason to take a poll as i really think major broadwater  though a good man might do as well in the discharge of his domestic concerns as in the capacity of a legislator and therefore i again express my wish that either you or colonel mason would offer i can be of little assistance to either because i early laid it down as a maxim not to propose myself and solicit for a second as to your political sentiments i would heartily join you in them so far as relates to a humble and dutiful petition to the throne provided there was the most distant hope of success but have we not tried this already have we not addressed the lords and remonstrated to the commons and to what end did they deign to look at our petitions does it not appear as clear as the sun in its meridian brightness that there is a regular systematic plan formed to fix the right and practice of taxation upon us does not the uniform conduct of parliament for some years past confirm this do not all the debates especially     those just brought to us in the house of commons on the side of government expressly declare that america must be taxed in aid of the british funds and that she has no longer resources within herself is there any thing to be expected from petitioning after this is not the attack upon the liberty and property of the people of boston before restitution of the loss to the india company was demanded a plain and selfevident proof of what they are aiming at do not the subsequent bills now i dare say acts for depriving the massachusetts bay of its charter and for transporting offenders into other colonies or to great britian for trial where it is impossible from the nature of the thing that justice can be obtained convince us that the administration is determined to stick at nothing to carry its point ought we not then to put our virtue and fortitude to the severest test with you i think it a folly to attempt more than we can execute as that will not only bring disgrace upon us but weaken our cause yet i think we may do more than is generally believed in respect to the nonimportation scheme as to the withholding of our remittances that is another point in which i own i have my doubts on several accounts but principally on that of justice for i think whilst we are accusing others of injustice we should be just ourselves and how this can be whilst we owe a considerable debt and refuse payment of it to great britain is to me inconceivable nothing but the last extremity i think can justify it whether this is now come is the question   0 i began with telling you that i was to write a short letter my paper informs me i have done otherwise i shall hope to see you tomorrow at the meeting of the county in alexandria when these points are to be considered i am dear sir your most obedient and humble servant  george washington  0 july      mount vernon bryan fairfax to bryan fairfax mount vernon  0 july      dear sir your letter of the   th was not presented to me till after the resolutions which were adjudged advisable for this county to come to had been revised altered and corrected in the committee nor till we had gone into a general meeting in the courthouse and my attention necessarily called every moment to the business that was before it  i did however upon     receipt of it in that hurry and bustle hastily run it over and handed it round to the gentlemen on the bench of which there were many but as no person present seemed in the least disposed to adopt your sentiments as there appeared a perfect satisfaction and acquiescence in the measures proposed except from a mr williamson who was for adopting your advice literally without obtaining a second voice on his side and as the gentlemen to whom the letter was shown advised me not to have it read as it was not like to make a convert and repugnant some of them thought to the very principle we were contending for i forbore to offer it otherwise than in the manner above mentioned which i shall be sorry for if it gives you any dissatisfaction in not having your sentiments read to the county at large instead of communicating them to the first people in it by offering them the letter in the manner i did that i differ very widely from you in respect to the mode of obtaining a defeat repeal of the acts so much and so justly complained of i shall not hesitate to acknowledge and that this difference in opinion may probably proceed from the different constructions we put upon the conduct and intention of the ministry may also be true but as i see nothing on the one hand to induce a belief that the parliament would embrace a favorable opportunity of repealing acts which they go on with great rapidity to pass and in order to enforce their tyrannical system and on the other i observe or think i observe that government is pursuing a regular plan at the expense of     law and justice to overthrow our constitutional rights and liberties how can i expect any redress from a measure which has been ineffectually tried already for sir what is it we are contending against is it against paying the duty of three pence per pound on tea because burthensome no it is the right only we have all along disputed and to this end we have already petitioned his majesty in as humble and dutiful manner as subjects could do nay more we applied to the house of lords and house of commons in their different legislative capacities setting forth that as englishmen we could not be deprived of this essential and valuable part of a constitution if then as the fact really is it is against the right of taxation that we now do and as i before said all along have contended why should they suppose an exertion of this power would be less obnoxious now than formerly and what reasons have we to believe that they would make a second attempt while the same sentiments filled the breast of every american if they did not intend to enforce it if possible      the conduct of the boston people could not justify the rigor of their measures unless there had been a requisition of payment and refusal of it nor did that measure require an act to deprive the government of massachusetts bay of their charter or to exempt offenders from trial in the place where offences were committed as there was not nor could not be a single instance produced to manifest the necessity of it are not all these things self evident proofs of a fixed and uniform plan to tax us if we want further proofs do not all the debates in the house of commons serve to confirm this and has not general gages conduct since his arrival in stopping the address of his council and publishing     a proclamation more becoming a turkish bashaw than an english governor declaring it treason to associate in any manner by which the commerce of great britain is to be affected exhibited an unexampled testimony of the most despotic system of tyranny that ever was practised in a free government in short what further proofs are wanted to satisfy one of the designs of the ministry than their own acts which are uniform and plainly tending to the same point nay if i mistake not avowedly to fix the right of taxation what hope then from petitioning when they tell us that now or never is the time to fix the matter shall we after this whine and cry for relief when we have already tried it in vain or shall we supinely sit and see one province after another fall a prey to despotism if i was in any doubt as to the right which the parliament of great britain had to tax us without our consent i should most heartily coincide with you in opinion that to petition and petition only is the proper method to apply for relief because we should then be asking a favor and not claiming a right which by the law of nature and our constitution we are in my opinion indubitably entitled to i should even think it criminal to go further than this under such an idea but none such i have i think the parliament of great britain hath no more right to put their hands into my pocket without my consent than i have to put my hands into yours for money and this being already urged to them in a firm but decent manner by all the colonies what reason is there to expect any thing from their justice     as to the resolution for addressing the throne i own to you sir i think the whole might as well have been expunged i expect nothing from the measure nor should my voice have accompanied it if the nonimportation scheme was intended to be retarded by it  for i am convinced as much as i am of my existence that there is no relief but in their distress and i think at least i hope that there is public virtue enough left among us to deny ourselves every thing but the bare necessaries of life to accomplish this end this we have a right to do and no power upon earth can compel us to do otherwise till they have first reduced us to the most abject state of slavery that ever was designed for mankind the stopping our exports would no doubt be a shorter cut than the other to effect this purpose but if we owe money to great britain nothing but the last necessity can justify the nonpayment of it and therefore i have great doubts upon this head and     wish to see the other method first tried which is legal and will facilitate these payments i cannot conclude without expressing some concern that i should differ so widely in sentiment from you in a matter of such great moment and general import and should much distrust my own judgment upon the occasion if my nature did not recoil at the thought of submitting to measures which i think subversive of every thing that i ought to hold dear and valuable and did i not find at the same time that the voice of mankind is with me i must apologize for sending you so rough a sketch of my thoughts upon your letter when i looked back and saw the length of my own i could not as i am also a good deal hurried at this time bear the thoughts of making off a fair copy i am c virginia convention       aug   went from colo bassetts to williamsburg to the meeting of the convention dined at mrs campbells spent ye evening in my lodgings       at the convention dined at the treasurers at my lodgings in the evening   dined at the speakers and spent the evening at my own lodgings   dined at the attorneys and spent the evening at my own lodgings   dined at mrs dawsons and spent the evening at my own lodgings   dined at mrs campbells and spent the evening at my own lodgings   left williamsburg about   oclock     george washington   august      williamsburg richard henry lee to richard henry lee williamsburg   august       dear sir if this letter should though i do not see any probable chance that it will reach your hands in time it is to ask if you do not think it necessary that the deputies from this colony should be furnished with authentic lists of the exports and imports annually more especially to and from great britain and in that case to beg of you to obtain such from the customhouse officers on the potomac and rappahannock i have desired the speaker if he should think it expedient and might not have thought of it to do the same from the york and james river offices i have got an account though not a certified one from mr wythe of our number of taxables in    0 since increased archy carey says to  0000 as would have appeared by the list which would have been returned in may if the session had gone on i am c p s if you should travel to philadelphia by land i should be glad of your company mr henry is to be at my house on his way tuesday the thirtieth instant      george washington    august      mount vernon bryan fairfax to bryan fairfax mount vernon    august      dear sir your letter of the  th instant  came to this place forwarded by mr ramsay a few days after my return from williamsburg and i delayed acknowledging   0 it sooner in the hopes that i should find time before i began my other journey to philadelphia to answer it fully if not satisfactorily but as much of     my time has been engrossed since i came home by company by your brothers sale and the business consequent thereupon in writing letters to england     and now in attending to my own domestic affairs previous to my departure as above i find it impossible to bestow so much time and attention to     the subject matter of your letter as i could wish to do and therefore must rely upon your good nature and candor in excuse for not attempting it     in truth persuaded as i am that you have read all the political pieces which compose a large share of the gazette at this time i should think it but for your request a piece of inexcusable arrogance in me to make the least essay towards a change in your political opinions for i am sure i have no new lights to throw upon the subject or any other arguments to offer in support of my own doctrine than what you have seen and could only in general add that an innate spirit of freedom first told me that the measures which administration hath for some time been and now are most violently pursuing are repugnant to every principle of natural justice whilst     much abler heads than my own hath fully convinced me that it is not only repugnant to natural right but subversive of the laws and constitution of great britain itself in the establishment of which some of the best blood in the kingdom hath been spilt satisfied then that the acts of a british parliament are no longer governed by the principles of justice that it is trampling upon the valuable rights of americans confirmed to them by charter and the constitution they themselves boast of and convinced beyond the smallest doubt that these measures are the result of deliberation and attempted to be carried into execution by the hand of power is it a time to trifle or risk our cause upon petitions which with difficulty obtain access and afterwards are thrown by with the utmost contempt or should we because heretofore unsuspicious of design and then unwilling to enter into disputes with the mother country go on to bear more and forbear to enumerate our just causes of complaint for my own part i shall not undertake to say where the line between great britain and the colonies should be drawn but i am clearly of opinion that one ought to be drawn and our rights clearly ascertained i could wish i own that the dispute had been left to posterity to determine but the crisis is arrived when we must assert our rights or submit to every imposition that can be heaped upon us till custom and use shall make us as tame and abject slaves as the blacks we rule over with such arbitrary sway i intended to have wrote no more than an apology     for not writing but i find i am insensibly running into a length i did not expect and therefore shall conclude with remarking that if you disavow the right of parliament to tax us unrepresented as we are we only differ in respect to the mode of opposition and this difference principally arises from your belief that they—the parliament i mean—want a decent opportunity to repeal the acts whilst i am as fully convinced as i am of my own existence that there has been a regular systematic plan formed to enforce them and that nothing but unanimity in the colonies a stroke they did not expect and firmness can prevent it it seems from the best advices from boston that general gage is exceedingly disconcerted at the quiet and steady conduct of the people of the massachusetts bay and at the measures pursuing by the other governments as i dare say he expected to have forced those oppressed people into compliance or irritated them to acts of violence before this for a more colorable pretense of ruling that and the other colonies with a high hand but i am done i shall set off on wednesday next for philadelphia whither if you have any commands i shall be glad to oblige

philadelphia robert mackenzie to captain robert mackenzie  philadelphia   october      dear sir your letter of the   th ultimo from boston gave me pleasure as i learnt thereby that you were well and might be expected at mount vernon in your way to or from james river in the course of the winter when i have said this permit me with the freedom of a friend for you know i always esteemed you to     express my sorrow that fortune should place you in a service that must fix curses to the latest posterity upon the contrivers and if success which by the by is impossible accompanies it execrations upon all those who have been instrumental in the execution i do not mean by this to insinuate that an officer is not to discharge his duty even when chance not choice has placed him in a disagreeable situation but i conceive when you condemn the conduct of the massachusetts people you reason from effects not causes otherwise you would not wonder at a people who are every day receiving fresh proofs of a systematic assertion of an arbitrary power deeply planned to overturn the laws and constitution of their country and to violate the most essential and valuable rights of mankind being irritated and with difficulty restrained from acts of the greatest violence and intemperance for my own part i confess to you candidly that i view things in a very different point of light from the one in which you seem to consider them and though you are led to believe by venal men—for such i must take the liberty of calling those newfangled counsellors who fly to and surround you and all others who for honors or pecuniary gratifications will lend their aid to overturn the constitution and introduce a system of arbitrary government—although you are taught i say by discoursing with such men to believe that the people of massachusetts are rebellious setting up for independency and what not give me leave my good     friend to tell you that you are abused grossly abused this i advance with a degree of confidence and boldness which may claim your belief having better opportunities of knowing the real sentiments of the people you are among from the leaders of them in opposition to the present measures of the administration than you have from those whose business it is not to disclose truths but to misrepresent facts in order to justify as much as possible to the world their own conduct give me leave to add and i think i can announce it as a fact that it is not the wish or interest of that government or any other upon this continent separately or collectively to set up for independence but this you may at the same time rely on that none of them will ever submit to the loss of those valuable rights and privileges which are essential to the happiness of every free state and without which life liberty and property are rendered totally insecure these sir being certain consequences which must naturally result from the late acts of parliament relative to america in general and the government of massachusetts bay in particular is it to be wondered at i repeat that men who wish to avert the impending blow should attempt to oppose it in its progress or prepare for their defence if it cannot be averted surely i may be allowed to answer in the negative and again give me leave to add as my opinion that more blood will be spilled on this occasion if the ministry are determined to push matters to extremity than history has ever yet furnished instances of     in the annals of north america and such a vital wound will be given to the peace of this great country as time itself cannot cure or eradicate the remembrance of but i have done i was involuntarily led into a short discussion of this subject by your remarks on the conduct of the boston people and your opinion of their wishes to set up for independency i am well satisfied that no such thing is desired by any thinking man in all north america on the contrary that it is the ardent wish of the warmest advocates for liberty that peace and tranquillity upon constitutional grounds may be restored and the horrors of civil discord prevented  i am very glad to learn that my friend stewart     was well when you left london i have not had a letter from him these five years nor heard of him i think for two i wish you had mentioned his employment i remain dear sir your most obedient servant      george washington    december      mount vernon james mercer to james mercer mount vernon    december      dear sir i do not recollect whether in my last i informed you that it was £   you gave for the negro kate and that the whole of your purchases in frederick amounted to £          if i did not then do it these will be found right and agreeable to the original entries i have heard nothing yet from colo payton respecting those lands which you appear charged with at the loudoun sale there is no doubt i     presume of courts or others taking them off your hands if there be the sums bid for them will require to be added to your account i cannot say but that i should have liked to have had      acres of land warranted to me instead of your granting   00 acres more or less for as it was upon the presumption that the tracts of gray and adams contained this quantity clear of disputed bounds that i agreed to give the price i did so if it falls short i mean more than is generally allowed for variation of instruments i shall not much like nor indeed think myself bound by it and am inclined to     think as mr carlyle also does that hough must have made some mistake in his measurement as the original patents to adams and gray together contain no more than      acres whilst it appears that adams patent runs into grays and one half or near it of grays is taken away by strutfields notwithstanding all which hough you say for i have no plat or report of his makes    acres more than is granted by both patents at the same time he differs but little i perceive by your plat from the original courses and distances i do not pretend either to be well acquainted with the phrases which constitute a general warranty but the words made use of by you for this purpose are not so strong and emphatical as i have generally observed upon these occasions which usually run in some such manner as this from the claim or claims of any person or persons whatsoever the said his — his heirs c doth warrant and will forever defend your covenant may for ought i know be tantamount although no such expressions are used and therefore i shall say nothing further on this head it was my intention to have run round the lines of these tracts and tried the contents of them myself but i have never been a day well since my return from frederick nor a day without company if you have adams conveyance i should be glad to be furnished with it when you send the copy of the power of attorney to mccoul and blair as i have no paper relative to this land except an unattested copy of the proprietors deed to him     i have wrote to your brother  since i came home i intended a short letter just to advise him of the amount of the sales but insensibly run into a long one inclosed is a copy of it as also of the two queries which he seems anxious for your answering the reason of my repeating them to you now being that they are again urged to me in a letter from mr montague if you choose to answer them it may be by way of letter to me which i can enclose to your brother it was for this reason i have furnished you with my preparatory letter as ye quantity of wheat threshed at marlborough agreeably to your letter of the   th inst is too much for a load and as the holidays are near at hand and bad weather probably approaching it will be out of my power to send for it very soon indeed this will always be the case which makes no material difference to me if it cannot be got ready for delivery before christmas it being difficult afterwards to procure craft till the frosts are thought to be over in the spring i have heard no person speak of the sale of cattle in frederick but what thought it a great one i have mentioned the average price to no one since but what thinks i might buy for much less and although i do not dispute as i have never seen the goodness of your cattle at marlborough yet give me leave my friend to tell you that you are too sanguine in your expectations in matters of this sort it is not my intention to buy at high prices as i am in no immediate   0 want my design as i raise a great deal of provender was to stock my plantations more plentifully than they are if i could purchase upon terms as i liked and hearing you talk of selling cattle from marlborough i thought it might answer both our purposes but you are to observe that if your bond upon delivery of the cattle is to have a credit for the amount of ye sale it is to all intents and purposes a ready money sale to both of us although no cash is deposited this in fact is the case in respect to the land which makes the £    allowed for your moiety equal to £      0 a year hence to say nothing of the disadvantage attending ready money sales and is a circumstance i did not advert to the kind of cattle i should prefer would be cows and heifers as they would put me into a full stock the soonest but when i wrote to you on this subject my intention if we could agree upon terms was to take off all you could spare of every kind if the person i should send liked the cattle at the price they should be offered and found they were not the worse for having a parcel picked out for your plantation use for i would not be concerned with refuse cattle at any rate i find in order to lay your brothers affairs fully before him in my next that it will be necessary for me to have copies of both the reports made by the commissioners neither of which i have as i think you spoke something of a plan when we were in frederick together of your committee being branched out to  different purposes i shall be obliged to you for forwarding me a copy of your resolution     respecting the matter a plan of this kind i am sure is necessary for us and we may be benefitted by a precedent with very great esteem and with the compliments of the season i remain c       george washington  0 january      james cleveland instructions for mr james cleveland  0 january      as i am resolved if no unforeseen accident happens to prevent it to have my people at work upon my lands on the ohio by the last day of march no steps previous to this undertaking should be delayed by which a disappointment must follow i therefore knowing it will take some time to collect provisions and tools to carry on this work and that the transportation of them in the spring early over the allegany mountains may be attended with difficulty and uncertainty do request and require you to go immediately over to gilbert simpsons in the redstone settlement and there do or attempt to do the following things— first engage anywhere between one hundred and fifty and two hundred bushels of indian corn and to prevent disappointments let it be actually lodged at gilbert simpsons before the first day of march also engage upon the best terms you can to be delivered as aforesaid about fifteen hundredweight of bacon and desire mr simpson by all means to have them securely lodged for you at his house by that time at furthest second engage upon the best terms you can such and so many canoes as are absolutely necessary to transport your provisions and tools down the river and to avoid the expense of bags as much as possible try if one of the canoes cannot be     fitted up in such a manner as to carry your corn and bacon with the assistance of one or two only perhaps the canoes built for me last year may again be got speak to major crawford on this head third if mr simpson has not already moved all the tools and necessaries which were carried out for me last spring from val crawfords let it be done as soon as you get out here with is a list of what he acknowledges he had left upon hand in september last as also of what he carried out take an exact account of everything you find and have them secured at mr simpsons ready at your departure down the river after which see what things you will want for your undertaking down the river and then fourth try if they are to be had out there at what prices and if you find the only difference to lie in the expense of the carriage out endeavor to buy every thing you can want there rather than run the hazard of sending them from hence in march and have them lodged as above for if you do not get every thing into his possession you may more than probable depend upon promises and be disappointed after your men are assembled and ready to start which must occasion a delay and of course a loss to me not only of time but in having men upon expence fifth it may not be amiss to engage potatoe seed and such things as will not only contribute to your better living but will in case corn should be found very scarce and difficult to be got make the less of it necessary for i do expect that from the breaking up of the plantations last year and the great number of people that will be going over this that corn will be very scarce and exceeding dear if you could get peach or any other kind of fruit stones or apple seeds it would not be amiss to engage them to carry out with you sixth inasmuch as both time and expences will be saved by engaging men in the redstone settlement to go with you down the river i would have you make diligent enquiry whether they are to be had and upon what terms and engage at least five upon the best terms you can and have them bound in the articles given you if you should meet with such people as you think will answer the purpose in your own neighborhood or elsewhere you might engage them provided you can depend     upon their going at the proper time and will transport themselves without any expence to me seventh if you can hire negro fellows or choose to carry any of your own upon the terms i mentioned to you there will not in that case be occasion to hire so many white men as above to wit five and as i am told that there are three of the servants which i sent out last spring still at mr val crawfords and his brother captain crawfords ready to be employed in my service you may direct them to stay where they are and be ready again the   th of march or if gilbert simpson wants hands for my mill work let them be employed instead of hirelings there till the   th of march aforesaid eight as the rest of the servants were sold and the money by this time become due i have desired mr val crawford if he has received it to pay it to you and if he has not to let you have the purchasers bonds which give to mr simpson and desire him to collect the money and apply it towards payment of the mill accounts if you can get corn or other provisions tools or other things of val crawford i would have you do it as it will save me the payment of cash but be sure to have the matter fixed in such a manner with him as to run no risque of a disappointment you may get corn and other things from captain crawford in like manner but that you may not depend too much upon these uncertain chances i now furnish you with £ 0 pennsylvania money and whatever it falls short of the amount of your purchases i will supply when you go out again that everybody may be paid for what you get of them as i must set off for the assembly by the first of february and shall want to see you before i go i would have you endeavor if it can conveniently be done to be down here by that time i have nothing more to add at present than to wish you success in your journey and am c supplementary instructions  i earnestly recommend to you to follow after the people i have sent out as soon as you can do it with safety as much depends upon making a proper beginning     if you should not arrive at gilbert simpsons till after william stevens is gone with the people provision and tools you will follow them by land and water as you shall find it most convenient i directed stevens to leave his baggage horses there in order that you might go by land if you chose it as it would be the most expeditious way and you would want the horses on the land to draw in your logs plow and bring in your game if you should go by land i shall have no objections to your buying and carrying two or three cows down with you if they are to be had upon reasonable terms if you should buy cows get a bull also that the breed may be propagated you will find a bell necessary for them as also for the horses as you know the general plan and design of my seating these lands i shall not hamper you with particular instructions but leave you to be governed by circumstances my first and indeed principal aim is to save as much land as possible in the shortest time and at the least expence if this could be done in such a manner and by such means as to be serviceable hereafter it would be so much the better and for this reason it is i shall leave you to act from circumstances it runs in my head that if there is a good stream of water upon any of the tracts and a convenient place out of the way of freshes to build a mill that this might be as good a method as any to save the land provided an industrious millwright could be engaged and there could be any certain prospect of getting iron work without much trouble or inconvenience when you see stevens call for the instructions i gave him in order that you may see what is there required and govern yourself thereby as nearly as circumstances will permit for i do not mean to tie you down strictly to any certain rule but to allow you to act in such a manner as shall appear most for my interest if you should find any of the white servants obstinate and determined not to behave well i hereby give you full power and authority to sell and dispose of them to the best advantage i have given stevens a description of each that in case any should attempt to runaway they may be advertised and every pains taken to recover them that can be consistently write to me by every opportunity as it is very probable that     not one letter in five will come to hand mention in all of them therefore what you want and how you go on after you have got a place inclosed try and buy me all the buffalo calves you can get and make them as gentle as possible i would not stick at any reasonable price for them especially the cow calves but i should like at least two bull calves for fear of accidents as i am very anxious to raise a breed of them take the two servants from major crawfords that he offered if you find from their character that they will answer your purpose and that they will be useful to you if you get them you may in my name promise them a year of their time if they behave so as to deserve it george washington    january      mount vernon john west to john west mount vernon    january      sir your letter of the  th which is just handed to me could not have given you more pain in writing than it has given me in reading because i never deny or even hesitate in granting any request that is made to me especially by persons i esteem and in matters of moment without feeling inexpressible uneasiness i do not wonder at your solicitude on account of your only son the nurturing and bringing him up in a proper course is no doubt an object of great concern to you as well as importance to him but two things are essentially necessary in the man to whom this charge is committed a capacity of judging with propriety of measures proper to be taken in the government of a youth and leisure sufficient to attend to the execution of these measures that you are pleased to think favorably of me in respect to the first i shall take for granted from the request     you have made but to show my incapacity of attending to the latter with that good faith which i think every man ought to use who undertakes a trust of this interesting nature i can solemnly declare to you that for a year or two past there has been scarce a moment that i could properly call my own what with my own business my present wards my mothers which is wholly in my hands colonel colvills mrs savages colonel fairfaxs colonel mercers and the little assistance i have undertaken to give in the management of my brother augustines concerns for i have absolutely refused to qualify as an executor together with the share i take in public affairs i have been kept constantly engaged in writing letters settling accounts and negotiating one piece of business or another by which means i have really been deprived of every kind of enjoyment and had almost fully resolved to engage in no fresh matter till i had entirely wound up the old thus much sir candor indeed the principle of common honesty obliged me to relate to you as it is not my wish to deceive any person by promising what i do not think it in my power to perform with that punctuality and rectitude which i conceive the nature of the trust would require i do not however give a flat refusal to your request i rather wish you to be fully informed of my situation that you may think with me or as i do that if it should please the almighty to take you to himself as soon as you apprehend but i hope without just cause your son may be placed in better hands than mine if you     think otherwise i will do the best i can merely as a guardian you will act very prudently in having your will revised by some person skilled in the law as a testators intentions are often defeated by different interpretations of statutes which require the whole business of a mans life to be perfectly conversant with them i shall not after what i have here said add any thing more than my wishes which are sincerely offered for your recovery and that you may live to see the accomplishment of your sons education with very great esteem sir i am c  george washington    february      mount vernon john connolly to john connolly mount vernon    february      dear sir your servant on his return from williamsburg affords me occasion to answer your polite letter i confess the state of affairs is sufficiently alarming which our critical situation with regard to the indians does not diminish but as you have wrote to     lord dunmore relative to the prisoners under your charge there can be no doubt of his lordships having now transmitted you the necessary directions on that subject i have only to express my most ardent wishes that every measure consistent with reason and sound policy may be adopted to keep those people at this time in good humor for another rupture would not only ruin the external but internal parts of this government if the journal of your proceedings in the indian war is to be published i shall have an opportunity of seeing what i have long coveted with us here things wear a disagreeable aspect and the minds of men are exceedingly disturbed at the measures of the british government the kings speech and address of both houses prognosticate nothing favorable to us but by some subsequent proceedings thereto as well as by private letters from london there is reason to believe the ministry would willingly change their ground from a conviction the forcible measures will be inadequate to the end designed a little time must now unfold the mystery as matters are drawing to a point i am c  george washington  th mar      mount vernon jno washington to jno washington mount vernon  th mar      dear sir mr fitzhugh delivered me your favr of the   th ulto on tuesday last—but as i received it on the     road i could not answer it by him  wish it was in my power to do it satisfactorily now— so far am i from having £ 00 to lend that involved as i am with one expence and another particularly on a very heavy charge of seating my lands over the alligany mountains in order to comply with the conditions of the grant i would gladly borrow that sum myself for a few months so exceeding difficult do i find it under the present scarcity of cash to collect enough to answer this emergency  at the same time comply with my other engagements— this information you may rely on as a fact from dr sir c george washington   march      william stevens instructions for william stevens   march      as mr james cleveland whom i have employed to take charge of my business upon the ohio is rendered unable at this time by sickness to proceed out with my people i must commit the care  management of them  the business to you till he can follow or till you can hear further from me proceed therefore without any unnecessary loss of time to mr gilbert simpsons on youghiogany where i expect provisions are laid in  where majr crawford will have in readiness tools  canoes ready to transport you down the river—do not delay one moment longer than you can help in that settlement but set out with all your necessaries by water for the great kanhawa—your provisions will go in casks which are provided for the purpose but the two horses which are sent for the purpose of drawing in your logs fetching in your provisions  tending your corn when they can be spared from other business must be sent down by land in the manner which shall appear most advisable to you at simpsons— the land you are to go to lays on the great kanhawa on the   0 lower or right hand side as you go up it—the tract begins abt two miles from the mouth of that river and runs up the same binding therewith for seventeen miles—you may begin your improvements therefore in any part but nearest the middle for fear of getting of it would be best if you can carry on your works to equal advantage to do wch you should examine the bottoms well to see where you can clear most in the shortest time so soon as you have pitchd upon the spot to begin your improvements on use every diligence in your power to get as much land as possible ready for corn  continue planting even with the rare ripe corn as long as you think it shall have time to come to perfection you may in the meanwhile be putting up houses for the convenience of yourselves to live in but do not spend any time in fencing in the field till it is too late to plant as the corn can take no injury till some time after it is up which will be time enough to begin fencing after the season is too far advanced for planting and you have inclosed the field—you are then to go to such other kinds of improvements as will go the furthest in saving the land—that is you are to build—to clear—to fence—to drain—or do any thing else agreeable to the act of assembly which will be highest valued in proportion to the work  the time spent thereon  i have a notion that draining will be found among the most profitable things you can do—but as it is impossible for me to judge at this distance you must be governd by circumstances and your own judgment which i hope will be employed as much as possible for my interest consult major crawford about a hunter  endeavr to secure a good one upon the best terms you can to attend you—this hunter might probably be a proper person to take the horses down— i do not know that any of the white servants will attempt to run away from you but to guard against it as much as possible keep a strict watch  as soon as you have got to the land draw your canoes without telling them the reason of it quite up the bank  cover them to prevent the sun from splitting them in the keg with the lead there is a canister of peachstone kernals near  000 let them be planted in drills as soon as you     get to the land  fixed upon a place for a plantation—also plant potatoes—pease  every thing of that kind in their proper seasons if you can get them to carry with you—and if you could get   boor    sow pigs to carry with you it would be a good thing as you will be under a necessity of depending upon hand mill stones for meal a pair of which are provided at mr simpsons you should take care to be provided with peck to keep them in order—also with a grind stone for your tools i have no reason to doubt but that you will find every thing provided at simpsons by the time you get out—if however it should turn out otherwise—i hope majr crawford will give you all the assistance he can in getting what is wanted as it will be a folly to go down without—get   light fluke plows leave with gilbert simpson an exact list of every thing you carry down the river though never so trifling for mr cleveland that he may know what you have  see if any thing further is necessary for him to provide—endeavour to make the servants and negroes take care of their cloathes  have them mended when wanted i give you a description of each servant—if any of them should run away advertize a good reward to any one that will bring them to you to me or majr crawford take great care of your tools that none are lost or left as you go along down—take care also that you have full enough of them for your hands if to spare so much the better as i shall probably send out more hands some time hence keep a list therefore of the quantity you have  call them over frequently—after you have built a house for yourselves there might also be one built to lock yr provisions tools c up in i cannot pretend to say with certainty when i shall be with you but hope it may happen in may—if not in may it shall be as soon after as i can make it convenient—nor can i judge with any certainty how long it will take you to save that tract on the great kanhawa which you are to go first to as it contains  0  0 acres but the buildings and other improvements ought to be valued at any rate before you go to the next tract or rather return to it as it lyes on the ohio three or four miles     above the rapid at the great bent in the ohio which is  0 odd miles above the mouth of the great kanhawa this is the next      acre tract i shall improve  lyes in bottetourt county as the large one of  0  0 acres does in fincastle county i give you money to bear your expences out and hope and beg that you will use as much frugality in travelling as possible—keep an exact acct of your expences that you may be able to settle with me when we meet or with mr cleveland in my behalf i would have you as it is as good a way as any go by mr clevelands house  if he is well enough to give it take his advise about your conduct if he thinks he shall be able to follow you in any reasonable time perhaps it may be necessary to leave the horses at gilbert simpsons for him  the negro that is run away to come after you by land  to drive two or three cows out if to be had from the red stone settlement sow the turnep seed which you carry as soon as you can with safety—and endeavour to provide watermellon seed—cucumbers— every kind of seed which will serve to make your corn cc hold out at the same time that it adds to your good living get three or   good strong padlocks at leesburg  as many strong lines for fishing as fish will be a great help to you get paper at leesburg and write frequently to me how you go on as letters are very apt to miscarry i wish you well  that success may attend you  am c      george washington    march      richmond john augustine washington to john augustine washington richmond    march      dear brother mr smith delivered me your letter of the   th instant but as one is generally in a hurry and bustle in such places and at such times as these i have only time to acknowledge it and add that it would have given me pleasure to have met you here i shall refer you to mr smith for an account of our proceedings up to this day and you cannot fail of learning the rest from the squire who delights in the minutiæ of a tale i am in doubt whether we shall finish here this week but as i shall delay little time on the road in returning i shall hope to see you on your way up or down from berkeley i am much obliged to you for the hollyberries and cottonseed my love to my sister and the children i had like to have forgot to express my entire approbation of the laudable pursuit you are engaged in of training an independent company i have promised to review the independent company of     richmond some time this summer they having made me a tender of the command of it at the same time i could review yours and shall very cheerfully accept the honor of commanding it if occasion require it to be drawn out as it is my full intention to     devote my life and fortune in the cause we are engaged in if needful i remain dear sir your most affectionate brother george washington  d april      mount vernon lord dunmore to lord dunmore mount vernon  d april      my lord at second hand i learnt from captain floyd that the surveys made by mr crawford under the proclamation of      expressly agreeable to an order of council of the   th of december      and for which your lordships patents under the seal of the colony hath actually been obtained are now declared null and void—the information appearing altogether incredible i gave little attention to it till i saw mr wilper on friday last who in confirmation of the report added that all the patentees whom he had seen under that proclamation were exceedingly distressed and at a loss to know what to think of it or how to act in a case so uncommon this therefore has caused me to give your lordship the trouble of a letter on the occasion convinced as i am of your inclination to hear and disposition to redress any just cause of complaint which may be submitted to your decision—in pursuit of this enquiry my lord which becomes highly interesting to me as well as others to make i shall beg leave to lay a short state of our case before your lordship in order to shew if the information be true for i confess i lookd upon it at first as a move only of the surveyors to filtch a     little more money from us the peculiar hardship of our situation if we are to encounter fresh difficulties in search of lands which in my humble opinion has already involved us in expence and trouble which ought to have been avoided i shall not presume my lord to ask a patient hearing of the reasons which induced mr dinwiddie to issue the proclamation of     —the proclamation itself is sufficiently declaratory of them and being an act of public notoriety the utility of which was well known at the time of its promulgation and as universally acknowledged to be just i shall say nothing thereon nor shall i undertake to prove how well men at very small daily pay were entitled to this testimony of his majestys bounty the experience your lordship has lately had of a warfare in that country affords a recent instance of the hardship and difficulty which the first troops had in exploring a trackless way over those great ridges of mountains between fort cumberland and pittsburgh and making roads for the armies which afterwards followed and in which they joined but i will take the liberty humbly to represent that instead of having extraordinary difficulties thrown in our way we were in my opinion entitled as well from the spirit as the express words of the proclamation above mentioned to the lands free of all costs and trouble for the truth of which i should have no scruple in appealing to your lordships candor if you would take the trouble of reading the proclamation wherein after setting forth the necessity of raising troops are these words—     for an encouragement to all who shall voluntarily enter into the said service i do hereby notify and promise by and with the advice and consent of his majestys council of this colony that over  above their pay  00000 acres of his majesty the king of great britains lands on the east side of the river ohio within this dominion  00000 acres to be contiguous to the said fort and the other  00000 acres to be on or near the river ohio shall be laid off  granted to such persons who by their voluntary engagement and good behavior in the said service shall deserve the same and i further promise that the said lands shall be divided amongst them immediately after the performance of the said service c—is it not to be inferred my lord from the natural import of these words that the lands were to be laid off for and divided amongst the grantees without involving them in either trouble or expence nothing in my humble opinion is more selfevident but they finding that the most valuable part of their grant respecting the location was actually preoccupied—that emigrants were spreading fast over that country—and that the same difficulties might arise in other quarters and contests ensue application was made for liberty to make our own surveys and a district assigned for it at least  00 miles from any settlement—unexplored by any countysurveyor unknown in whose districts it lay if it lay in any as the jurisdiction of no county had extended within the number of miles above mentioned—and but few men at that early day hardy enough to undertake a work     in a wilderness where none but savages  wild beasts inhabited—i say under these circumstances application was made for a special surveyor and an order of council obtained in the following words— the council also advised that colo washington should apply to the president  masters of the college requesting them to nominate  appoint a person properly qualified to survey the said land with all possible expedition signifying to them that their compliance herein will be agreeable to this board in consequence of this order  of capt crawfords qualification as a surveyor he was appointed to run out this  00000 acres of land and having given bond in the usual  accustomed form to the college proceeded to the business and making his returns to the secretarys office patents have been issued under your lordships signature  the seal of the colony ever since the first of december      would it not be exceedingly hard then my lord under these circumstances—at this late day—after we had proceeded in all respects agreeably to the orders of government and after many of us have been run to great  considerable expence to declare that the surveys are invalid it appears in so uncommon a light to me that i hardly know yet how to persuade myself into a belief of the reallity of it nor should i have given your lordship any trouble on the subject at this time but for the importunity of others and from a desire as i shall leave home the first of may of knowing if the account be true what steps the grantees under the aforementioned proclamation are further to take     i beg your lordships excuse for the length and freedom of this epistle i am persuaded you possess too much candour yourself to be offended at it in others in relating of facts especially as i profess myself to be with the utmost respect etc  george washington   april      mount vernon montague to montague mount vernon   april      sir my letter of the  th of december to colo mercer dispatched by the first opportunity that offered after the close of his sales would inform you of the total amount thereof  that the contest between miss wroughton and messrs dick  hunter respecting a preference of mortgages would more than probable be avoided i have now to acknowledge the receipt of your favor of the   th of august  to acquaint you that the packet herewith sent to colo mercer contains such papers  documents as are necessary to give the fullest information of the state of his affairs in this country which circumstances considered have turned out infinitely beyond my expectation or the expectation of every one who bestowd any   0 thought upon them i shall not therefore at this time trouble you either with a recital or copies of those papers but add that i have directed the attorney general mr randolph who was retained as counsel for colo mercer  his mortgages to appeal from any decision which might even appear to give messrs dicks and hunters trustdeed the preference to miss wroughtons mortgage for as to mr gravats it is entirely out of the question no person disputing the validity of his mortgage mr james mercer in a letter which i received from him some time ago proposed a matter which if acceded to might ultimately secure miss wroughton and put an end to all controversy respecting the mortgage i shall communicate the proposal in his own words as follows it appears to me to be yet of some consequence to messrs dick  hunter if they are postpond to miss wroughton—tho none to miss wroughton—in this way—if they are postpond and the purchasers are not punctual they will not receive their money but out of the last payments by which mr dick may be greatly affected for in the mean time his estate may be seized  sold for half its value as miss wroughton cannot want all her money at once  will be sufficiently secured i could wish she woud consent to let the speakers debt be paid next after she will receive £ 000—coud this be granted i shall not dispute her preference my answer shews how much this debt is—if she will consent i will guarantee her debt or let her have a     preference pray be so kind as to mention this to mr montague after considering this proposal you will be so good sir as to let me know miss wroughtons sentiments thereon that i may communicate them to mr mercer  conform to them myself it gives me much pain to find two gentln brothers who individually stand high in the esteem of their countrymen imbibing unfavorable impressions and to their joint friends mutually arraigning the conduct of each other when i am satisfied that both think themselves right and that neither hath made proper allowance for the situation of the other at colo mercers request i propounded the queries he transmitted to his brother whose answers in a letter to me are forwarded to him but these things only serve to irritate for as i am thoroughly satisfied on the one hand that colo mercer has advanced nothing to you or mr gravat but what was perfectly consistent with his ideas of truth  justice—so on the other i am as well persuaded that mr james mercer hath not intentionally wronged him of a farthing  yet appearances may be against him for want of a thorough knowledge of his situation  the motives which influenced his conduct—that colo mercer has been a considerable loser in the management of his estate here nobody will deny but has not every gentleman in this country whose other avocations or whose inclinations would not permit them to devote a large portion of their time  attention to the management of their own     estates shared the same fate our gazettes afford but too many melancholy proofs of it in the sales which are daily advertised the nature of a virginia estate being such that without close application it never fails bringing the proprietors in debt annually as negroes must be clothed  fed taxes paid c c whether anything is made or not—but colo mercer must i think have been well acquainted with two facts namely that his brother had neither leisure nor a competent knowledge of plantation business to become a fit person to undertake it—and that stewards in this country at least far removed from the inspection of a superior are scarce ever to be entrusted—but all this is foreign from the main purpose of my letter and is an evil out of the power of poor mercer or his friends to remedy at this day the uneasiness i feel at seeing two brothers accustomed to live in perfect amity now bickering  accusing each other of hardships occasioned by the other led me into this digression for which i ask your pardon i hope this letter will find you in a better state of health than your last describes  with esteem  respect c george washington   april—     mount vernon george mercer to mercer extract mount vernon   april—     i enclose you a copy of my last letter of the  th of december and an account of the proceedings of

each from george washington  george washington    may      philadelphia george william fairfax to george william fairfax england philadelphia    may       dear sir before this letter will come to hand you must undoubtedly have received an account of the engagement     in the massachusetts bay between the ministerial troops for we do not nor can we yet prevail upon ourselves to call them the kings troops and the provincials of that government but as you may not have heard how that affair began i enclose you the several affidavits which were taken after the action general gage acknowledges that the detachment under lieutenantcolonel smith was sent out to destroy private property or in other words to destroy a magazine which selfpreservation obliged the inhabitants to establish and he also confesses in effect at least that his men made a very precipitate retreat from concord notwithstanding the reinforcement under lord percy the last of which may serve to convince lord sandwich and others of the same sentiment that the americans will fight for their liberties and property however pusillanimous in his lordships eye they may appear in other respects from the best accounts i have been able to collect of that affair indeed from every one i believe the fact stripped of all coloring to be plainly this that if the retreat had not been as precipitate as it was and god knows it could not well have been more so the ministerial troops must have surrendered or been totally cut off for they had not arrived in charlestown under cover of their ships half an hour before a powerful body of men from marblehead and salem was at their heels and must if they had happened to be up one hour sooner inevitably have intercepted their retreat to charlestown unhappy it is though to reflect that a brothers sword has been sheathed in a brothers breast and that the once happy and     peaceful plains of america are either to be drenched with blood or inhabited by slaves sad alternative but can a virtuous man hesitate in his choice i am with sincere regard and affectionate compliments to mrs fairfax dear sir your c  acceptance of appointment on the    june      congress having resolved that a general be appointed to command all the continental forces raised or to be raised for the defence of american liberty proceeded to a     choice and the ballots being taken george washington esq was unanimously elected on the day following the president informed mr washington that congress had unanimously made choice of him to be general and commanderinchief of the american forces and requested he would accept that employment to which mr w standing in his place answered mr president though i am truly sensible of the high honor done     me in this appointment yet i feel great distress from a consciousness that my abilities and military experience may not be equal to the extensive and important trust however as the congress desire it i will enter upon the momentous duty and exert every power i     possess in the service and for support of the glorious cause i beg they will accept my most cordial thanks for this distinguished testimony of their approbation but lest some unlucky event should happen unfavourable to my reputation i beg it may be remembered   0 by every gentleman in the room that i this day declare with the utmost sincerity i do not think myself equal to the command i am honored with as to pay sir i beg leave to assure the congress that as no pecuniary consideration could have tempted me to accept this arduous employment at the     expense of my domestic ease and happiness i do not wish to make any profit from it i will keep an exact account of my expenses those i doubt not they will discharge and that is all i desire      commission as commanderinchief in congress the delegates of the united colonies of newhampshire massachusetts bay rhode island connecticut newyork new jersey pennsylvania new castle kent  sussex on delaware maryland virginia north carolina and south carolina to george washington esquire we reposing especial trust and confidence in your patriotism conduct and fidelity do by these presents constitute and appoint you to be general and commander in chief of the army of the united colonies and of all the forces raised or to be raised by them and of all others who shall voluntary offer their service and join the said army for the defence of american liberty and for repelling every hostile invasion thereof and you are hereby vested with full power and authority to act as you shall think for the good and welfare of the service and we do hereby strictly charge and require all officers and soldiers under your command to be obedient to your orders  diligent in the exercise of their several duties and we do also enjoin and require you to be careful in executing the great trust reposed in you by causing strict discipline and order to be observed in the army and that the soldiers are duly exercised and provided with all convenient necessaries and you are to regulate your conduct in every respect by the rules and discipline of war as herewith given you and punctually to observe and follow such orders and directions from time to time as you shall receive from this or a future congress of the said united colonies or a committee of congress for that purpose appointed this commission to continue in force until revoked by this or a future congress by order of the congress dated philadelphia june   th      john hancock president attest chas thomson secr     george washington    june      philadelphia martha washington to mrs martha washington philadelphia    june      my dearest i am now set down to write to you on a subject which fills me with inexpressible concern and this concern is greatly aggravated and increased when     i reflect upon the uneasiness i know it will give you it has been determined in congress that the whole army raised for the defence of the american cause shall be put under my care and that it is necessary for me to proceed immediately to boston to take upon me the command of it you may believe me my dear patsy when i assure you in the most solemn manner that so far from seeking this appointment i have used every endeavor in my power to avoid it not only from my unwillingness to part with you and the family but from a consciousness of its being a trust too great for my capacity and that i should enjoy more real happiness in one month with you at home than i have the most distant prospect of finding abroad if my stay were to be seven times seven years but as it has been a kind of destiny that has thrown me upon this service i shall hope that my undertaking it is designed to answer some good purpose you might and i suppose did perceive from the tenor of my letters that i was apprehensive i could not avoid this appointment as i did not pretend to intimate when i should return that was the case it was utterly out of my power to refuse this appointment without exposing my character to such censures as would have reflected dishonor upon myself and given pain to my friends this i am sure could not and ought not to be pleasing to you and must have lessened me considerably in my own esteem i shall rely therefore confidently on that providence which has heretofore preserved and been bountiful to me not     doubting but that i shall return safe to you in the fall i shall feel no pain from the toil or the danger of the campaign my unhappiness will flow from the uneasiness i know you will feel from being left alone i therefore beg that you will summon your whole fortitude and pass your time as agreeably as possible nothing will give me so much sincere satisfaction as to hear this and to hear it from your own pen my earnest and ardent desire is that you would pursue any plan that is most likely to produce content and a tolerable degree of tranquillity as it must add greatly to my uneasy feelings to hear that you are dissatisfied or complaining at what i really could not avoid as life is always uncertain and common prudence dictates to every man the necessity of settling his temporal concerns while it is in his power and while the mind is calm and undisturbed i have since i came to this place for i had not time to do it before i left home got colonel pendleton  to draft a will for me by the directions i gave him which will i now enclose the provision made for you in case of my death will i hope be agreeable i shall add nothing more as i have several letters to write but to desire that you will remember me to your friends and to assure you that i am with the most unfeigned regard my dear patsy your affectionate c     george washington    june      philadelphia john parke custis to john parke custis philadelphia    june      dear jack i have been called upon by the unanimous voice of the colonies to take the command of the continental army it is an honor i neither sought after or was by any means fond of accepting from a consciousness of my own inexperience and inability to discharge the duties of so important a trust however as the partiality of the congress has placed me in this distinguished point of view i can make them no other return but what will flow from close attention and upright intention—for the rest i can say nothing my great concern upon this occasion is the thought of leaving your mother under the uneasiness which i fear this affair will throw her into i therefore hope expect and indeed have no doubt of your using every means in your power to keep up her spirits by doing everything in your power to promote her quiet i have i must confess very uneasy feelings on her account but as it has been a kind of unavoidable necessity which has led me into this appointment i shall more readily hope that success will attend it and crown our meetings with happiness at any time i hope it is unnecessary for me to say that i am always pleased with yours and nellys abidance at mount vernon much less upon this occasion when i think it absolutely necessary for the peace and satisfaction of your mother a consideration which i have no doubt will have due weight with you both and require no arguments to enforce     as the public gazettes will convey every article of intelligence that i could communicate in this letter i shall not repeat them but with love to nelly and sincere regard for yourself i remain c p s—since writing the foregoing i have received your letter of the fifteenth instant i am obliged to you for the intelligence therein contained and am glad you directed about the tobacco for i had really forgot it you must now take upon yourself the entire management of your own estate it will no longer be in my power to assist you nor is there any occasion for it as you have never discovered a disposition to put it to a bad use the congress for i am at liberty to say as much are about to strike two millions of dollars as a continental currency for the support of the war as great britain seems determined to enforce us into—and there will be at least fifteen thousand raised as a continental army as i am exceedingly hurried i can add no more at present than that i am c george washington    june      philadelphia colonel bassett to colonel bassett philadelphia    june      dear sir— i am now imbarked on a tempestuous ocean from whence perhaps no friendly harbor is to be found i have been called upon by the unanimous voice of the colonies to the command of the continental army it is an honor i by no means aspired to it is an honor i wished to avoid as well from an unwillingness     to quit the peaceful enjoyment of my family as from a thorough conviction of my own incapacity  want of experience in the conduct of so momentous a concern but the partiallity of the congress added to some political motives left me without a choice may god grant therefore that my acceptance of it may be attended with some good to the common cause  without injury from want of knowledge to my own reputation i can answer but for three things a firm belief of the justice of our cause close attention in the prosecution of it and the strictest integrity if these cannot supply the place of ability  experience the cause will suffer  more than probable my character along with it as reputation derives its principal support from success but it will be remembered i hope that no desire or insinuation of mine placed me in this situation i shall not be deprived therefore of a comfort in the worst event if i retain a consciousness of having acted to the best of my judgment i am at liberty to tell you that the congress in committee which will i dare say be agreed to when reported have consented to a continental currency and have ordered two million of dollars to be struck for payment of the troops and other expenses arising from our defence as also that   000 men are voted as a continental army which will i daresay be augmented as more troops are imbarked  imbarking for america than was expected at the time of passing that vote as to other articles of intelligence i must refer you to the gazette as the printers pick up every     thing that is stirring in that way the other officers in the higher departments are not yet fixed therefore i cannot give you their names i set out tomorrow for boston where i shall always be glad to hear from you my best wishes attend mrs bassett mrs dandridge  all our relations  friends in great haste as i have many letters to write and other business to do i remain with the sincerest regards dear sir c ps i must entreat you and mrs bassett if possible to visit at mt vernon as also my wifes other friends i could wish you to take her down as i have no expectation of returning till winter  feel great uneasiness at her lonesome situation i have sent my chariot  horses back george washington  0 june      philadelphia to the captains of several independent companies in virginia philadelphia  0 june      gentlemen i am now about to bid adieu to the companies under your respective commands at least for a while i have launched into a wide and extensive field too boundless for my abilities and far very far beyond my experience i am called by the unanimous voice of the colonies to the command of the continental army an honor i did not aspire to an honor i was solicitous to avoid upon a full conviction of my inadequacy to the importance of the service the partiality of the congress however assisted by a political   0 motive rendered my reasons unavailing and i shall tomorrow set out for the camp near boston i have only to beg of you therefore before i go especially as you did me the honor to put your companies under my direction and know not how soon you may be called upon in virginia for an exertion of your military skill by no means to relax in the discipline of your respective companies  i have the honor to be c     george washington  0 june      philadelphia john augustine washington to john augustine washington philadelphia  0 june      dear brother i am now to bid adieu to you and to every kind of domestic ease for a while i am embarked on a wide ocean boundless in its prospect and in which perhaps no safe harbor is to be found i have been called upon by the unanimous voice of the colonies to take the command of the continental army an honor i neither sought after nor desired as i am thoroughly convinced that it requires greater abilities and much more experience than i am master of to conduct a business so extensive in its nature and arduous in the execution but the partiality of the congress joined to a political motive really left me without a choice and i am now commissioned a general and commanderinchief of all the forces now raised or to be raised for the defence of the united colonies that i may discharge the trust to the satisfaction of my employers is my first wish that i shall aim to do it there remains as little doubt of how far i may succeed is another point but this i am sure of that in the worst event i shall have the consolation of knowing if i act to the best of my judgment that the blame ought to lodge upon the appointers not the appointed as it was by no means a thing of my own seeking or proceeding from any hint of my friends i am at liberty to inform you that the congress in a committee which will i dare say be agreed to when reported have consented to a continental currency     have ordered two millions of dollars to be struck for payment of the troops c and have voted fifteen thousand men as a continental army which number will be augmented as the strength of the british troops will be greater than was expected at the time of passing that vote general ward general lee general schuyler and general putnam are appointed majorgenerals under me the brigadiergenerals are not yet appointed major gates is made adjutantgeneral  i expect to set out tomorrow     for boston and hope to be joined there in a little time by ten companies of riflemen from this province maryland and virginia for other articles of intelligence i shall refer you to the papers as the printers are diligent in collecting every thing that is stirring i shall hope that my friends will visit and endeavor to keep up the spirits of my wife as much as they can as my departure will i know be a cutting stroke upon her and on this account alone i have many very disagreeable sensations i hope you and my sister although the distance is great will find as much leisure this summer as to spend a little time at mount vernon my sincere regards attend you both and the little ones and i am your most affectionate brother george washington   th    june      new york to the continental congress new

some other occurrences too trivial to mention which happened on the road prevented my arrival at this place until the afternoon of this day in the morning after giving general schuyler     such orders as from the result of my inquiry into matters here appear necessary i shall set out on my journey to the camp at boston and shall proceed with all the dispatch in my power powder is so essential an article that i cannot help again repeating     the necessity of a supply the camp at boston from the best accounts i can get from thence is but very poorly supplied at this place they have scarce any how they are provided in general woosters camp i have not been able yet to learn  governor tryon is arrived and general schuyler directed to advise you of the line of conduct he moves in i fear it will not be very favourable to the american cause i have only to add that i am with the greatest respect and regard george washington       june        oclock p m new york to the continental congress new york sunday       june        oclock p m sir upon my arrival here this afternoon i was informd that an express was in town from the provincial camp in massachusets bay and having seen among other papers in his possession a letter directed to you as president of congress i have taken the liberty to open it     i was induced to take that liberty by several gentlemen of new york who were anxious to know the particulars of the affair of the   th inst and agreeable to the orders of many members of the congress who judged it necessary that i should avail myself of the best information in the course of my journey you will find sir by that letter a great want of powder in the provincial army which i sincerely hope the congress will supply as speedily  as effectually as in their power one thousand pounds in wt were sent to the camp at cambridge three days ago from this city which has left this place almost destitute of that necessary article there being at this time from the best information not more than four bbs of powder in the city of n york i propose to sett off for the provincial camp to morrow and will use all possible dispatch to join the forces there please to make my compliments to the gentlemen the congress george washington    june      new york philip schuyler to majorgeneral philip schuyler new york    june      sir you are to take upon you the command of all the troops destined for the new york department and see that the orders of the continental congress are carried into execution with as much precision and exactness as possible for your better government therein you are herewith furnished with a copy of the instructions     given to me by that honorable body such parts thereof as are within the line of your duty you will please to pay particular attention to delay no time in occupying the several posts recommended by the provincial congress of this colony and putting them in a fit posture to answer the end designed neither delay any time in securing the stores which are or ought to have been removed from this city by order of the continental congress keep a watchful eye upon governor tryon and if you find him attempting directly or indirectly any measures inimical to the common cause use every means in your power to frustrate his designs  it is not in my power at this time to point out the mode by which this end is to be accomplished but if forcible measures are judged necessary respecting the person of the governor i should have no difficulty in ordering of them if the continental congress was not sitting but as this is the case and the seizing of governors quite a new thing and of exceeding great importance i must refer you to that body for direction if the governor should make any move towards increasing the strength of the tory party or     in arming them against the cause we are embarked in in like manner watch the movements of the indian agent colonel guy johnson and prevent as far as you can the effect of his influence to our prejudice with the indians  obtain the best information you can of the temper and disposition of those people and also of the canadians that a proper line may be marked out to conciliate their good opinion or facilitate any future operation the posts on lake champlain c you will please to have properly supplied with provisions and ammunition and this i am persuaded you will aim at doing on the best terms to prevent our good cause from sinking under a heavy load of expense you will be pleased also to make regular returns to me once a month and to the continental congress and oftener as occurrences may require of the forces under your command of your provisions stores c and give me the earliest advices of every piece of intelligence which you shall judge of

that with which i am now honored i cannot but feel sentiments of the highest gratitude for this affecting instance of distinction and regard  0  may your warmest wishes be realized in the success of america at this important and interesting period and be assured that every exertion of my worthy colleagues and myself will be equally extended to the reëstablishment of peace and harmony between the mother country and these colonies as to the fatal but necessary operations of war when we assumed the soldier we did not lay aside the citizen  0  and we shall most sincerely rejoice with you in that

governor of virginia in        printed in sparks writings of washington ii       i set out for williamsburg the day after the date of my letter but found i was unable to proceed my fever and pain increasing upon me to a high degree and the physicians assured me that i might endanger my life by prosecuting the journey in consequence of that advice i returned to this place again and informed your honor of the reason of my detention by the post whom i met on the road and who i have since understood never lodged my letter in the postoffice at fredericksburg which is the cause of my now writing to the same purport when i shall be sufficiently able to attempt the journey again i cannot say but i shall make no delay after i am in a condition to perform it—to president blair  0 february        colonel stanwix replied—i have been favored with your obliging letter and find your judgment tallies with lord loudouns and mine in regard to major smiths wild scheme   soon after writing this letter he went to williamsburg having attended to the necessary affairs which called him there he returned to his command at fort loudoun about the  st of april while he was in williamsburg the assembly was in session and an act passed to augment the forces of the colony to two thousand men besides the three companies of rangers a bounty of ten pounds was to be paid to every new recruit to serve only till december a second regiment was organized and officers appointed by the same act all the virginia forces were to be united by direction of the president or commanderinchief to such troops as should be furnished by his majesty or by the other colonies for a general expedition against the enemy and were to be subject to the orders of the commanding officer of his majestys forces in america when pitt assumed office he recognized the importance of the struggle in america and recalled the incompetent loudoun appointing general john forbes to the command in his instructions urging the southern colonies to new efforts pitt wrote and all officers of the provincial forces as high as colonels inclusive are to have rank according to their several respective commissions in like manner as is already given by his majestys regulations to the captains of provincial troops in america  0 december      to his london agent washington wrote you are pleased to dub me with a title i have no pretentions to—that is ye honble   april        col john forbes of the   th foot who had been lord loudouns adjutantgeneral was commissioned a brigadiergeneral and directed to undertake a new expedition against fort duquesne—penn mag hist ix     this hardly consists with sir johns conduct in a case that occurred at this time forty cherokees had come naked and without arms to fort loudoun and governor denny asked sir john if he would order these indians to be supplied with guns match coats and a little leather to make moccasins sir john answered that the assembly and people of this province had such singular and unreasonable nations of indians and particularly the cherokees that he would not have any thing to do with them nor order the indians the things wanted—penn col rec viii      the indians seem to anticipate our success by joining us thus early with seven hundred of their warriors of whose good inclinations to assist his majestys troops captain bosomworth who held a conference with their chiefs can fully inform you and to whom i shall refer there are two things however which i must beg leave to indicate as likely to contribute greatly to their ease and contentment to wit an early campaign and plenty of goods these are matters which they often remind us of both in their public councils and private conferences—to brigadiergeneral forbes    april      colonel stephen had just arrived at fredericksburg with the two companies returned from south carolina these troops were daily expected at fort loudoun   permit me to return you my sincere thanks for the honor you were pleased to do me in a letter to mr president blair and to assure you that to merit a continuance of the good opinion you have therein expressed of me shall be among my principal studies i have no higher ambition than to act my part well during the campaign and if i should thereby merit your approbation it will be a most pleasing reward for the toils i shall undergo it gives me no small pleasure that an officer of your experience abilities and good character should be appointed to command the expedition and it is with equal satisfaction i congratulate you upon the promising prospect of a glorious campaign—to general forbes    april        this power of drafting the militia with which the forts were to be garrisoned while the regular troops were employed in the expedition was conferred equally on the president and the commanderinchief a substantial proof of the confidence reposed in the latter by the assembly although in this case as in all others he could not be prevailed upon to exercise a delegated power to any greater extent than was absolutely necessary for a full discharge of the duties of his station—sparks   mercer was lieutenantcolonel of the second or new regiment the commanding officer of this regiment was colonel byrd   this indians account of ft duquesne corresponds with most others i have heard vizt that it is strong on the landside but stockaded only where it faces the ohioriver it does not appear from his information that there are many men there or that they have thrown up any new works he saw a party on the other side of the river which he supposed to be newly come because there were several canoes near them and they seemed to be busy in putting up bark huts which however were not many—and only two tents pitched when he had got about    miles on this side of fort duquesne he came upon a large indian encampment and tracks steering towards virginia and after the parties had joined and were marching in lt gist came upon a track of another large party pursuing the same course these parties have since fallen upon the backinhabitants of augusta county and destroyed near  0 persons besides an officer and    men belonging to captn hogs rangingcompany who we suppose for i have no advice from him were sent to the countrypeoples assistance as soon as i obtained notice of this i ordered a detachment from the regiment and some indians that were equipped for war to march and endeavor to intercept their retreat—if they are not too numerous—i have also engaged ucahula with a small party of brisk men to go immediately for ft duquesne and try to get a prisoner he seems confident of success and promises to be back in  0 days at the farthest the two virginia companies from carolina came to this place yesterday—enclosed is

this place for their nation about the   th or   th of last month it appears that the deputy indian agent gist gave the raven a present to prevent bad talks among his people   the second regiment was raised only for the campaign and by the terms of the act of assembly it was to be disbanded and the men discharged on the first of december whereas the soldiers of the first regiment were enlisted to serve during the war   as the government in england had determined to prosecute offensive operations on the southern frontiers great preparations had been contemplated for a vigorous campaign under general forbes against fort duquesne mr pitt had on the  0th of december written a circular to the governors of pennsylvania and the several colonies at the south requesting a hearty cooperation from the assemblies in aid of general forbes expedition he stipulated that the colonial troops raised for this purpose should be supplied with arms ammunition tents and provisions in the same manner as the regular troops and at the kings expense so that the only charge to the colonies would be that of levying clothing and paying the men the governors were also authorized to issue commissions to provincial officers from colonels downwards and these officers were to hold rank in the united army according to their commissions had this liberal and just system been adopted at the outset it would have put a very different face upon the military affairs of the colonies majorgeneral abercromby who had succeeded lord loudoun to the command in america assigned six thousand troops to pennsylvania virginia and maryland as their quota for the expedition to the ohio of this number the pennsylvania assembly resolved to raise two thousand seven hundred—votes c of the assembly vol iv p     the maryland assembly voted one thousand but their bill was defeated by the usual quarrel with the governor who refused his assent to their proposed mode of levying the tax to defray the expense—votes and

pennsylvania sixteen hundred from virginia two or three hundred from maryland who had been stationed in garrison at fort frederick under colonel dagworthy and also two companies from north carolina making in all including the wagoners between six and seven thousand men among the inclosed you will find a letter from mr strother concerning the french negro i wrote to him for by your desire this negro is a shrewd sensible fellow and may be useful if he was not sent into the inhabitants for the purpose of discoveries rather than of his own accord for the purpose of escape he is very well acquainted with the ohio and its dependencies but has been longer from fort du quesne than i at first understood he will set out from this tomorrow with a waggon i shall send towards fort loudoun in pennsylvania and i shall desire that he may be forwarded to you from thence—to sir john st clair    june      i shall leave this fort loudoun the   d inst with three companies of my regiment one of

confess require a considerable time before the indians that are yet to be sent for coud join us but as the inevitable obstructions to be met with in forming magazines erecting the posts and marching on must require much time it may be effected and the farther the summer is advancd the operations of the campaign for many obvious reasons coud be executed with the greater security unless there shoud eer then happen a decisive action to the no ward and the enemy prove successful in that case they woud pour in their troops upon us to the southward at all events they coud easily prevail upon many of their northward indians by promises and the views of plunder to join their troops upon the ohio another misfortune that woud arise by a late campaign is that the limited time for the service of the  d virginia regiment woud be near or perhaps quite elapsed before the campaign coud be over   i expect to march tomorrow agreeable to my orders woodwards company of the first regiment coverd the

washington it is therefore possible to compare the two series and illustrate in what manner washington altered his letters in later years i have except where otherwise stated printed the original as

here—washington to colonel bouquet    july        from a draft in washingtons ms   washington and bouquet met on july  0th and it is probable this letter was written at that time although it may belong to an earlier date referring to the expedition mentioned in the letter of july    page      fort ligonier was afterwards built on this spot   the road up the allegheny mountains so far as cleared by information is steep stony and of very difficult access even alpine difficulties attend the lightest carriages how the artillery c will be got up this and laurel hill must be left to better judges and time to determine—wm ramsay to washington    august        they flatter themselves with getting a better road than general braddocks they may do so and i shall believe it when i am an eyewitness thereof—not before—washington to walker    august      i offer you my sincere congratulations upon the discovery of a good road which i hear you have made—washington to st clair    august      the question of the road by which the troops were to reach the ohio occasioned great uneasiness in washington and gave rise to a belief on his part that lord loudoun had been unduly influenced by pennsylvania in his decision in march      the general had called for a description of the frontiers and pennsylvania promptly replied showing that through the county of cumberland was a great and good wagon road thro this province to virginia and carolina on which are harris ferry the towns and forts of carlisle and shippensburg the magazine at mcdowells mill and forts loudoun and lyttleton to this fine valley there is an easy access from the ohio by several good passes in the mountains through one of these passes ran a path through rays town    miles from shippensburgh and through another a path leading to franks town situated about  0 miles north of rays town and affording a bad passage by reason of swamps and broken hills a new road was opened and cleared thro rays town over the allegheny hills for the use of general braddock and is now a good one—penn col records vii     in june sir john st clair asserted the necessity of opening one or more roads on the frontiers of cumberland county and it was doubtless to his efforts that an attempt to cut a new road was determined upon this new route instead of passing through carlisle was to be directed through york town fort frederick and fort cumberland making the distance from lancaster to fort du quesne about     miles or no longer than the existing road but easier to get over and allowing some use of the potomac for transport of goods not only would the passage of the troops carry advantage to the colony through which it was made but the rich lands of the ohio would attract settlers and it was the wish of virginia to possess the main road to that region this was one of the reasons for washingtons insistance and he was certain of a support from the colony the virginians are making great interest that our rout may be by fort cumberland but i hope they will not succeed—james young to r peters    july      the virginians are much chagrined at the opening of the road through this government and colonel washington has been a good deal sanguine and obstinate upon the occasion—armstrong to peters   october      such was his insistance that general forbes took offense and in writing to bouquet advised him to consult with washington though perhaps not follow his advice as his behaviour about the roads was no ways like a soldier general forbes had good reason for delay as the indian allies of the french were in council with the english colonies and should they be weened from their hostility a serious blow would be given to french influence and french power in that quarter a success far greater than mere force of arms could attain it was bouquets opinion after the fall of du quesne that had the braddock road been taken at first as washington wished the expedition would have been doomed—bouquet to allen    november      as it was the treaty of easton deprived the french of their main strength and when it was perceived that the season was too advanced to complete the new road the troops employed upon it were recalled and an advance ordered by way of turkey creek with ultimate success—parkman monicalm and wolfe ii     et seq   i was this instant favored with yours per express i am not surprised to hear the enemy are about but have really been astonished at the calm that has prevailed so long i shall this moment send out a party to waylay the road i anticipated this order by requesting leave to do it in a letter i wrote to you yesterday—washington to bouquet   august      i could wish most sincerely that our accounts from the northward were clearer and more favorable than they appear to be if you have any intelligence from ticonderoga i should be extreme thankful for the account we have expected hourly to hear that louisburg is in our hands pray heaven we may not be disappointed at last—washington to bouquet    august        as it is highly necessary to keep the enemy in doubt about our roads the general desires that you continue sending strong parties along with orders to reconnoitre where the junction of the two roads could be made i hear by kelly who is gone from loy h—to the salt lick that it is about    miles across from that post to the end of chestnut ridge where this path goes and the woods so open that without cutting carrying horses may easily go through all pretty level—bouquet to washington    august        i detached captain mckenzie with four officers and    rank and file to way lay the road at the great crossing from him a sergeant and four active woodsmen are to proceed to fort duquesne so that i am in great hopes we shall be able to get some intelligence of the strength of the enemy at that place—washington to bouquet    august        this afternoon the party commanded by capt mckenzie returned without being able to discover any thing of the enemys motions they waylaid the road for several days near the great crossings and intended to have advanced quite to that post had not their provisions entirely spoiled notwithstanding every method and the utmost pains for its preservation was taken some of their advanced sentries had nearly killed a small party of   cherokee indians returning from war this small party went from hence upwards of six weeks ago and this is the fourth day since they left fort duquesne the environs of which they long watched at length was obliged to cross the ohio where they killed two squaws whose scalps they brought in here they say there are a good many women and children on that side the river but very few men either french or indians at the fort captn mckenzie says there is no sign of the enemy having been lately on general braddocks road so far as he proceeded on it sergeant scott and four privates of his party went on to fort duquesne so soon as they return will transmit you any intelligence they may procure—washington to bouquet    august      sergeant scot mentioned in a late letter this day returned—he when within   miles of fort duquesne came upon a few fresh trails making inwards which he followed apprehending that they were just at hand till his provisions were expended and was thereby obligd to return without making any discoveries worth mentioning—washington to bouquet    august        i went saturday to the top of the allegheny hill where i had the satisfaction to see a very good road  0 loaded wagons went up without doubling their teams and proceeded as far as edmunds swamp—bouquet to washington    august        twenty five according to the letterbook   when the convoy got within   miles of this place   cuttawba men and   squaws contrary to the advice of the officers set on before the convoy for their garrison and soon after were fired upon by  0 or    of the enemy who killed captn bullen and captn french and wounded one of the squaws the loss we sustain by the death of these two indian warriors is at this juncture very considerable as they were very remarkable for their bravery and attachment to our interests—particularly poor bullen whom and the other we buried with military honors the rest of the cuttawbas and what nottaways and tuscaroras that are here sets out tomorrow with the waggons for raystown as we had intelligence of several parties of the enemy being about i detachd parties in different ways in hopes of coming up or cutting of the retreat of some of them but without any effect—at same time i reinforced the convoy with  0 men—washington to bouquet    august        the governors in america have no command of the troops even of their own province as soon as they are joined with any other of his majestys forces unless they have a commission from the commanderinchief for that purpose i have commanded the forces at philadelphia and at charles town tho the governor

shewn to pennsylvania were not in a very good humor and not thinking any attempt would be made on fort duquesne so late in the year they passed an act to withdraw the first regiment from the regulars after the first of december and station them upon the frontiers of this colony for the protection of the inhabitants but upon some letters that the governor received about a fortnight after that assembly broke up assuring him that an attempt would be made he thought it proper to call the assembly again and they accordingly met on thursday last when he laid the letters before them which they immediately took into consideration and that no blame might be laid to this colony for the failure of the expedition which they imagined some people would be glad of having an opportunity of doing they proceeded with a despatch never before known and in three days passed an act to empower the governor to continue the forces in the pay of this colony on that service till the first of january if the expedition was not over before that time—robinson to washington    septem      gov fauquier hoped that the ardor this colony has shewn to support the war will continue for another year the flame

council of war was called and it was determined to be inadvisable to proceed further that season but the report of three prisoners who were shortly afterwards brought in and who communicated the weak state of the garrison at fort duquesne induced a change of opinion and the enterprise was prosecuted the keeping fort duquesne if we should be fortunate enough to take it in its present situation will be attended with great advantages to the middle colonies and i do not know so effectual a way of doing it as by the communication of fort cumberland and general braddocks road which is in the first place good and in the next fresh affording good food if the weather keeps open which is more than a road can do as much used as this has been—washington to general forbes    november        steelyards

this campaign may be found in the papers relating to the french occupation in western pennsylvania published in the pennsylvania archives second series vol vi extracts from a few of the more important letters are here quoted—m de ligneris has written me from fort duquesne on the  0th of last month he continues to have parties out who brought him two prisoners on the  0th from whom he learned that general forbes was immediately expected at royal amnon where there were more than  000 men under the command of colonel bouquet with   pieces of cannon on field carriages and several mortars that a fort had been built there of piece upon piece and one saw mill as for the rest they are ignorant whether fort duquesne is to be attacked this fall that the provincials had orders to go into winter quarters that they had been since countermanded but that people still spoke of dismissing them that there are no more horned cattle at royal amnon but plenty of provisions of flour and salt meats that the english suppose us to be very numerous at fort duquesne i am not sure my lord whether the enemy will organize any expedition this fall or wait until spring the advanced season and the two advantages we have gained in succession over them would lead me to hope that they will adopt the latter course tis much to be desired for twould not be possible for m de ligneris to resist the superiority of the enemys forces meanwhile he will use all means in his power to annoy them embarrass their communications and intercept their convoys it is a great pity that he has been absolutely obliged by the scarcity of provisions to reduce his garrison to  00 men fortunately the messages he has delivered in my name to the delawares and chawenons of the beautiful river have confirmed these nations in their attachment to the french the delawares of the mountains have also favorably received the messages sent to them and are beginning to remove their villages to our territory i have renewed my orders to all the posts to procure for m de ligneris early in spring all the assistance in their vicinity i beg you my lord to be pleased fully to assure his majesty that i will neglect nothing to preserve for him the possession of the beautiful river and of this colony in general that it will not be my fault should our enemies make eventually any progress but in fact and strict truth the salvation of this colony will depend on the prompt arrival of the succors of every description which i have had the honor to demand of you—m de vaudreuil to m de massiac    november      we obtained some new advantages on the beautiful river at the close of the month of october the english repaired in force on the   d of november to within three leagues of fort duquesne which was

mississippi which is ascended thirty leagues to reach the fort of the illinois and the garrison retreated to fort machault where it still remained on the  th of march according to intelligence received on the day before yesterday    scarcity of provisions and the bad position of fort duquesne have compelled its abandonment the consequences may become unfortunate if the indians pronounce in favor of the english although they hesitate they appear still attached to us tis to be hoped that they will remain at least neutral m de ligneris who commands at fort machault writes that the english are constructing forts at attiqué and royal hannon that the indians are become very familiar with them he flatters himself however that he will induce them to strike if he receive reinforcements

troop of pennsylvania with a proportionable number of virginia and maryland forces   while the capture and destruction of fort duquesne and the occupation by the english removed for the time the fear of a french invasion the western and northern tribes of indians were still too closely bound to the french and offered a more dangerous and insidious weapon of offense against the frontiers of the colonies than any line of french forts or number of french troops could have supplied french influence still controlled among the indians of the upper country though shaken by the retreat from fort duquesne french missionaries were more active in maintaining and extending french interests french traders divided with the english the rich fur trade of the western country and a greater liberality and a more intelligent exercise of authority gave the french a hold upon the tribes that the english in vain long sought to break the high utility of indian allies and the importance of maintaining their influence over the tribes were clearly recognized by montcalm de vaudreuil and other of the french commanders and no effort was spared to establish that influence the more firmly to counteract these endeavors the colonies sought first to so intimidate the openly hostile tribes as to induce them to break with the french and become allies of the english or at all events neutral in case of war and secondly to remove all causes of complaint by prohibiting settlement on lands claimed by the indians and by regulating the system of conducting trade with the indians to accomplish these ends effectually the united action of the colonies was desirable no single colony would be able to cope with the indians in war and the different measures adopted by the different colonies presented serious obstacles to the proper control and regulation of relations with the indians in time of peace the organ of communication between the crown and the indians had been the governors of the respective colonies the engrossing and multifarious duties of the governors in other directions led to a neglect of indian affairs while the want of proper agents of system and uniformity of treatment arising from this neglect and a conflict of interest among the colonies induced great abuses and kept the indians and settlers perpetually at difference and oftentimes at war the colonies licensed traders but the character of these privileged persons was not inquired into and the contempt which washington had for them was in general the uniform sentiment north as well as south franklin called them the most vicious and abandoned wretches of our nation works ii     sir william johnson spoke of the albany commissioners for indian affairs as persons of very little capacity who were all devoted to their own interest and trade and by whose means the french were constantly supplied with indian and other goods thro the channel of canada indians to the lords of trade    november

note pennsylvania adopted the massachusetts idea at the treaty of carlisle      and it was the place of deposit constructed by the ohio company that led to the indian war in which washington served franklin urged the framing of some uniform policy of direction before the albany congress of      the plan of union was not adopted and in default of action by the colonies the crown introduced a new system the colonies were divided into two districts the northern and the southern and over each was placed a superintendent or agent for the affairs of indians holding his commision from the crown and independent of the colonial government the indian outbreak of      directed attention to certain inconveniences of this arrangement and the english government called upon the agents to suggest alterations the reply of sir william johnson one of the ablest and most successful indian agents of that period may be found in the second series of the pennsylvania archives vi  00 the royal proclamation of october      appears to have anticipated in a measure his recommendations see note to the letter of washington to crawford    september      post the policy thus introduced of confining the trade to certain posts and places was advantageously applied to the southern colonies but was not so effective in the north principally because of the easy connection the indians could have with canada and the number of posts necessary and the expense of maintaining them in      the commissioners of trade proposed to entrust the entire management of the indian trade to the colonies

his own generous and grateful heart discharged the duty with great dignity but with such warmth of coloring and strength of expression as entirely to confound the young hero he rose to express his acknowledgments for the honor but such was his trepidation and confusion that he could not give distinct utterance to a syllable he blushed stammered and trembled for a second when the speaker

shipped in the bland to account for the lowness of the price that some of the tobacco was small i shall not undertake to dispute but at the same time i must observe that it was clean and neatly handled which i apprehended would have rendered the other objection of very little weight as to stemming my tobacco in the manner you recommend i would readily do it if the returns would be equivalent to the trouble and loss of the stem and of this i shall be a tolerable judge as i am at no small pains this year to try the quality with the advantages and disadvantages of different kinds of tobaccos and shall at the same time find out the difference between a hogshead of leaf and a hogshead of stemmed tobacco by comparing then the loss of the one with the extra price of the other i shall be able to determine which is the best to pursue and follow that method which promises the most certain advantages some of the tobaccos which i put on board the unity captain cozzens got damaged in carrying to the warehouses for inspection and had a part cut off which will no doubt deface it a little but as this happened while i was at williamsburg i am able to give you no exact information concerning it in this parcel of tobacco there are three kinds which please to give me your opinion upon    as i have ever laid it down as an established maxim that every person is most certainly ought to be the best judge of what relates to his own interest and concerns i very rarely undertake to propose schemes to others which may be attended with uncertainty and miscarriage this will at once account for my being among the last who should advise your sending a vessel into the potomac for the accommodation of your friends there that i have often thought of it as a desirable thing for the shippers i will readily confess and have as often concluded that so soon as you found an established consignment formed here you would do it of course and sooner we ought not to expect it since you have proposed the matter yourself to me i certainly must approve of it and as you are so obliging as to write that you shall direct the master to be under my notice i hope you will be persuaded to believe that i shall readily contribute my best advice and assistance towards his despatch the tobaccos of most of your friends upon the potomac or that shipt from thence lie within fifteen miles above and below this place and as good or the best harbor piscataway is within sight of my door it has this great advantage besides good anchorage and lying safe from the winds that it is out of the way of the worm which is very hurtful to shipping a little lower down and lies in a very plentiful part of the country i thought it incumbent upon me to mention these things after which do as you please if i had received any intimation of your sending a vessel into this river i should not have engaged any part of my tobacco to cuzzens and while i remain in expectation of her arrival i will not seek a freight elsewhere

to jno askew that he went to work at your house was not only with my knowledge but by my express desire and had he stayd there til this time it would have been perfectly agreeable to me but as you know when he left your work so i can assure you that he never came to mine until wednesday or thursday last i then asked him if he did not think himself one of the most worthless and ungrateful fellows that ever lived for his treatment of me—for you must know sir that so small a job as making the front gate in my yard was left him to do when i went to williamsburg abt the  0th of may last and was found undone at my return altho i urged him in the strongest manner i could to get it finished for this very prevalent reason namely that i might inclose my chariot horses in a pasture round my house secured by a post  rail fence and by that means prevent them from breaking into a field where i had about  0 acres of peas that is now by his idleness and there letting in my sheep entirely rooted out this as i before said he neglected and i was from that time untill a day or two before mr carlyle asked for him to go to belvoir ere i coud get him to work again so that you may partly judge from this of the provocation he has given me but you will be more convinced of it when i tell you that the ballce he owes me is for tools imported for him and money actually lent to keep him from starving and from a goal from whence at least the sheriffs custody i have once or twice redeemed him—and lent him money to cloath  by necessaries for his family this is the real truth of the case and it is so far from any wanting to keep him longer than he will finish the gate and repays   days work due to my carpenters and how about that i never desire to see his face again if he can fall upon any method of paying me what he owes me in money i have made an exchange of plantations with old saml johnson giving the place where clifton lived for the lots he held in the neck otherwise i shd

further opinion of the matter—washington to robert stewart   may        the shawanese delawares senecas and other ohio tribes of indians had made a general and almost simultaneous attack upon all the remote frontier settlements and posts they had committed many murders and taken the forts at le bœuf venango presquisle and others on lake michigan the miami river the wabash at sandusky and michilimackinac fort pitt formerly duquesne was in imminent danger of falling into their hands in july colonel bouquet was despatched by general amherst with five hundred men and a supply of military stores for the relief of that fort he marched through pennsylvania following the same route that had been pursued by general forbess army the indians who were then besieging fort pitt heard of his march and came out to meet him they attacked his army on the  th and  th of august in a defile near the head waters of turtle creek bushy run and the contest was kept up during the two days with considerable loss on both sides colonel bouquet maintained his ground and routing the indians marched without further molestation to fort pitt the news of this action seems not to have reached washington when he wrote the above letter general amherst wrote to sir wm johnson some random shots were fired on the army between bushy run and fort pitt but this seasonable check i believe will put an effectual stop to any further mischief being done on that communication particularly as colonel stephen with   or  00 men of the virginia militia is advanced as far as forts cumberland and bedford with a view not only of covering the frontiers but of acting offensively against the savages this public spirited colony has also sent a body of the like number of men under the command of colonel lewis for the defence and protection of their southwest frontiers what a contrast this makes between the conduct of the pennsylvanians and virginians highly to the honor of the latter but places the former in the most despicable light imaginable    august      the king signified his displeasure at the supine and neglectful conduct of the pennsylvania legislature and urged more vigorous measures upon all the colonies except virginia and maryland earl of halifax to sir jeffrey amherst    october        the commercial possibilities of the great dismal swamp in norfolk county virginia and in north carolina had early attracted the attention of virginians in      william byrd noted that norfolk had a pretty deal of lumber from the borderers on the dismal who make bold with the kings land thereabouts without the least ceremony they not only maintain their stocks upon it but get boards shingles and other lumber out of it in great abundance    it would require a great sum of money to drain it but the public treasure could not be better bestowed than to preserve the lives of his majestys liege people and at the same time render so great a tract of swamp very profitable besides the advantage of making a channel to transport by water carriage goods from albemarle sound into nansemond and elizabeth rivers in virginia—history of the dividing line  0    in january      a company was chartered by the legislature of virginia for the purpose of draining and rendering fit for cultivation the swamp and washington was interested little appears to have been done before the revolution for the subsequent history see washington to hugh williamson   march      post   pocoson is a word applied to any reclaimed marsh—webster bartlett defines it as low wooded grounds or swamps in eastern maryland and virginia mostly dry in summer and covered with water in winter—dictionary of americanisms   byrd speaks of a mr brinkley who dwells a little to the southward of the line      lyell noted when in this region that strange to say instead of being lower than the level of the surrounding country it the swamp is actually higher than nearly all the firm and dry land which encompasses it and to make the anomaly complete in spite of its semifluid character it is higher in the interior than towards the margin the only exceptions to both these statements are found on the western side where for the distance of about twelve or fifteen miles the streams flow from slightly elevated but higher land and supply all its abundant and overflowing water towards the north the east and the south the waters flow from the swamp to different rivers which give abundant evidence by the rate of their descent that the great dismal is higher than the surrounding firm ground—travels in north america i           by the most exact survey they the surveyors found the breadth of the dismal in this place to be completely fifteen miles—byrd  0   the swamp is the source of no less than five several rivers which discharge themselves southward into albemarle sound and of two that run northerly into virginia    the rivers that head in it from virginia are the south branch of nansemond and the west branch of elizabeth and those from carolina are northwest river north river pasquotank little river and pequimons—byrd history of the dividing line    i have retained in the text the spelling that washington gave of these rivers and swamps which differs much from byrds thus byrd speaks of coropeak which is the oropeak of washington cypress and not cyprus mossy instead of mossey   in the event of your ever visiting america i am in hopes you will not think a little time ill spent in a small tour to virginia we have few things here striking to european travellers except our abundant woods but little variety a welcome reception among a few friends and the open and prevalent hospitality of the country in general might perhaps prove agreeable for a while and i must be permitted to add that i shall think myself very happy in seeing you at mt vernon where you might depend upon finding the most cordial entertainment the indians at a time when we thought ourselves fixed in the utmost tranquillity have in open violation of the treaty recommenced hostilities and by a sudden irruption thrown the frontiers of almost all the colonies into terrible consternation they have lately met with some pretty rugged treatment and it is hoped they will sue for terms again in a very little while—to richard washington    september      we have been curiously entertained of late with the description of an engine lately constructed i believe in switzerland and which has undergone some improvements since in england for taking up trees by the roots among other things it is related that trees of a considerable diameter are forced up by this engine that six hands in working one of them will raise two or three hundred trees in the space of a day and that an acre of ground may be eased of the trees and laid fit for ploughing in the same time how far these assertions may have been amply realized by repeated experiments it is impossible for me at this distance to determine but if the accounts are not greatly exaggerated such powerful assistance must be of vast utility in many parts of this wooden country where it is impossible for our force and laborers are not to be hired here between the finishing of one crop and preparations for another to clear grounds fast enough to afford the proper changes either in the planting or farming business the chief purport of this letter therefore is to beg the favor of you gentlemen to make minute inquiries into the trials that have been made by order of the society and if they have proved satisfactory to send me one of these engines by the first ship bound to this potomack river if they are made of different sizes i should prefer one of a middle size capable of raising a tree of fifteen or eighteen inches diameter the costs i am pretty much a stranger to fifteen twenty and twentyfive guineas have been spoke of but the price were it double that i should totally disregard provided the engine is capable of performing what is related of it and not of that complicated nature which would cause it to be easily disordered and rendered unfit for use but constructed on so plain simple and durable a plan that the common artificers of this country may be able to set them to rights if any accidents should happen to them if you should send one be so good as to let me have with it the most ample directions for the effectual using of it together with a model of its manner of operating—to robert cary  co    february      about one month after this letter was written col george mercer arrived in williamsburg as chief distributor of stamps for virginia but almost immediately resigned the office which he found so obnoxious to his countrymen the manner in which this resignation was brought to pass is described in the penn journal no      and he doubtless thought himself justified in appointing james mercer his deputy when he sailed for england in november   i should be obliged to you for sending me one of the rotheran or patent plows if the construction of them are not thoroughly understood in liverpool you would do me a singular favor in getting it from a place of that name in yorkshire where i suppose they were first invented and now are made for none but the true sort will answer the end of my sending for it and i had rather be at the expence of the carriage from thence than not to have the right kind or be disappointed you will please to order it to be made exceeding light as our lands are not so stiff as yours nor our horses so strong—to crosbies  trafford   march      likewise

pleasing sensations upon the receipt of your letter of the   th of february covering accounts of sales for one hundred and fiftythree hogsheads of master custiss tobacco and one hundred and fifteen of mine that the sales are pitifully low needs no words to demonstrate and that they are worse than many of my acquaintance upon the river potomac have got in the outports and from mr russell and other merchants of london for common aronoke tobacco is a truth equally as certain nay not so good as i myself have got from mr gildart of liverpool for light rent tobaccos shipped to him at the same time i did to you of the meanest sort such as you once complained of as the worst of maryland and not salable can it be otherwise than a little mortifying then to find that we who raise none but sweetscented tobacco and endeavor i may venture to add to be careful in the management of it however we fail in the execution and who by a close and fixed correspondence with you contribute so largely to the despatch of your ships in this country should meet with such unprofitable returns surely i may answer no notwithstanding you will again receive my own crops this year and sixtyseven hogsheads of master custiss but gentlemen you must excuse me for adding as i cannot readily conceive that our tobaccos are so much depreciated in quality as not only to sell much below other marks of good repute but actually for less as i before observed than the commonest kinds do that justice to myself and ward will render it absolutely necessary for me to change my correspondence unless i experience an alteration for the better    tobacco i well perceive for a year or two past has fallen in its value from what causes i shall not take upon me to determine and i am not so extravagant as to believe that my own and master custiss crops should fetch their usual prices when other good tobacco met with abatements but i am really selfish enough to expect that we ought to come in for a part of good prices that are going from a belief that our tobacco is of a quality not so much inferior to some that still sells well and that so considerable a consignment when confined in a manner to one house as ours is would lay claim to the best endeavors of the merchant in the sales and in the return of goods for many articles of which i pay exceeding heavily another thing i cannot easily account for unless it is on a presumption that they are bought at very long credits which by no means ought to be the case for where a person has money in a merchants hand he should doubtless have all the benefits that can result from that money and in a like manner where he pays interest for the use of the merchants should he be entitled to the same advantages otherwise it might well be asked for what purpose is it that interest is paid once upon my urging a complaint of this nature you wrote me that the goods ought to be sent back and they should be returned upon the shopkeepers hands in cases of imposition but a moments reflection points out the inconveniences of such a measure unless the imposition be grossly abusive or we could afford to have a years stock beforehand how otherwise can a person who imports bare requisites only submit to lie a year out of any particular article of clothing or necessary for family use and have recourse to such a tedious and uncertain way of relief as this when possibly a tradesman would deny the goods and consequently refuse them it is not to be done we are obliged to acquiesce in the present loss and hope for future redress these gentlemen are my sentiments fully and candidly expressed without any design believe me of giving you offense but as the selling of our tobaccos well and the purchasing of our goods upon the best terms are matters of the utmost consequence to our welldoing it behoves me to be plain and sincere in my declarations on these points previous to any change of measures that i may stand acquitted of the imputation of fickleness if i am at last forced to a discontinuance of my correspondence with your house—to robert cary  co  0th september        government is set at defiance not having strength enough in her hands to enforce obedience to the laws of the community the private distress which every man feels increases the general dissatisfaction at the duties laid by the stamp act which breaks out and shews itself upon every trifling occasion—gov fauquier to earl of halifax june         unseasonable as it may be to take any notice of the repeal of the stamp act at this time yet i cannot help observing that a contrary measure would have introduced very unhappy consequences those therefore who wisely foresaw such an event and were instrumental in procuring the repeal of the act are in my opinion deservedly entitled to the thanks of the wellwishers to britain and her colonies and must reflect with pleasure that through their means many scenes of confusion and distress have been prevented mine they accordingly have and always shall have for their opposition to any act of oppression and that act could be looked upon in no other light by every person who would view it in its proper colors i could wish it was in my power to congratulate you on the success in having the commercial system of these colonies put upon a more enlarged and extensive footing than it is because i am well satisfied that it would ultimately redound to the advantage of the mother country so long as the colonies pursue trade and agriculture and would be an effectual let to manufacturing among them the money therefore which they raise would center in great britain as certainly as the needle will settle to the poles—washington to capel  osgood hanbury    july      the repeal of the stamp act to whatsoever cause owing ought much to be rejoiced at for had the parliament of great britain resolved upon enforcing it the consequences i conceive would have been more direful than is generally apprehended both to the mother country and her colonies all therefore who were instrumental in procuring the repeal are entitled to the thanks of every british subject and have mine cordially—washington to robert cary

lands claimed by the tribes and the abuses committed by indian traders and their servants this proclamation restrained all persons from trading with the indians without a license and prohibited all settlements beyond the limits described as the boundary of the indian hunting ground thus putting both the property and the commerce of the natives under the protection of officers acting under the

removing shortly after to st marys he established a school in his house and among his pupils was john parke custis at this time he was a constant and voluminous correspondent of washington but on the advent of the revolution he became a loyalist and as such a severe critic of washingtons conduct it is in the light of that position that the following extract from his autobiography must be read mr washington was the second of five sons of parents distinguished neither for their rank nor fortune laurence their eldest son became a soldier and went on the expedition to carthagena where getting into some scrape with a brother officer it was said he did not acquit himself quite so well as he ought and so sold out soon after which he died at barbadoes george who like most people thereabouts at that time had no other education than reading writing and accounts which he was taught by a convict servant whom his father bought for a schoolmaster first set out in the world as surveyor of orange county an appointment of about half the value of a virginia rectory i e perhaps  00 l a year when the french made encroachments on our western frontier in      this washington was sent out to examine on the spot how far what was alleged was true and to remonstrate on the occasion he published his journal on this occasion which in virginia at least drew on him some ridicule yet when soon after a regiment was raised in virginia he had interest enough to be appointed the lieutenantcolonel of it or rather i believe at first the major only a colonel jefferson it was fry who had formerly been grammar master in the college commanded the regiment and a colonel muse innes who had been a sergeant and therefore knew something of military discipline and exercise was the second in command jefferson soon died and muse was disgraced from some imputations of cowardice so that the command devolved on mr washington at braddocks defeat and every subsequent occasion throughout the war he acquitted himself much in the same manner as in my judgment he has since done—i e decently but never greatly i did know mr washington well and though occasion may call forth traits of character that never could have been discovered in the more sequestered scenes of life i cannot conceive how he could otherwise than through the interested representations of party have ever been spoken of as a great man he is shy silent stern slow and cautious but has no quickness of parts extraordinary penetration nor an elevated style of thinking in his moral character he is regular temperate strictly just and honest excepting that as a virginian he has lately found out that there is no moral turpitude in not paying what he confesses he owes to a british creditor and as i always thought religious having heretofore been pretty constant and even exemplary in his attendance on public worship in the church of england but he seems to have nothing generous or affectionate in his nature just before the close of the last war he married the widow custis and thus came into possession of her large jointure he never had any children and lived very much like a gentleman at mount vernon in fairfax

constitution of virginia and by the ability he displayed in the convention for forming the constitution of the united states and also in the virginia convention for adopting that instrument he was opposed to the constitution as encroaching too much on state rights and containing the principles of a consolidated government an exhaustive biography of this virginian is now being written by his descendant miss kate mason rowland of baltimore   containing resolves of the merchants of philadelphia respecting the nonimportation of articles of british manufacture   the following is an extract from mr masons reply to this letter dated the same day— i entirely agree with you that no regular plan of the sort proposed can be entered into here before the meeting of the general court at least if not of the assembly in the mean time it may be necessary to publish something preparatory to it in our gazettes to warn the people of the impending danger and induce them the more readily and cheerfully to concur in the proper measures to avert it and something of this sort i had begun but am unluckily stopped by a disorder which affects my head and eyes as soon as i am able i shall resume it and then write you more fully or endeavor to see you in the mean time pray commit to writing such hints as may occur our all is at stake and the little conveniences and comforts of life when set in competition with our liberty ought to be rejected not with reluctance but with pleasure yet it is plain that in the tobacco colonies we cannot at present confine our importations within such narrow bounds as the northern colonies a plan of this kind to be practicable must be adapted to our circumstances for if not steadily executed it had better have remained unattempted we may retrench all manner of superfluities finery of all descriptions and confine ourselves to linens woollens c not exceeding a certain price it is amazing how much this practice if adopted in all the colonies would lessen the american imports and distress the various traders and manufacturers in great britain this would awaken their attention they would see they would feel the oppressions we groan under and exert themselves to procure us redress this once obtained we should no longer discontinue our importations confining ourselves still not to import any article that should hereafter be taxed by act of parliament for raising a revenue in america for however singular i may be in my opinion i am thoroughly convinced that justice and harmony happily restored it is not the interest of these colonies to refuse british manufactures our supplying our mother country with gross materials and taking her manufactures in return is the true chain of connexion between us these are the bands which if not broken by oppression must long hold us together by maintaining a constant reciprocation of interest proper caution should therefore be used in drawing up the proposed plan of association it may not be amiss to let the ministry understand that until we obtain a redress of grievances we will withhold from them our commodities and particularly refrain from making tobacco by which the revenue would lose fifty times more than all their oppressions could raise here had the hint which i have given with regard to taxation of goods imported into america been thought of by our merchants before the repeal of the stamp act the late american revenue acts would probably never have been attempted the assembly in may was the first that met after the arrival of lord botetourt as governor the burgesses had been together but a few days when they passed a series of very strong resolves respecting the rights of the colonies the governor took the alarm and immediately dissolved the assembly as soon as the burgesses left the public hall they all met again at a private house in williamsburg may   th      appointed a moderator and assented unanimously to nonimportation agreement otherwise called an association consisting of a preamble and eight resolves it was signed by every member present and sent throughout the country for the signatures of the people washington was a member of the assembly at that time but it is very doubtful if he was present at the meeting his diary for that day says dind at mr dawsons  went to bed by   oclock he contributed however one pound to the expenses of the meeting which was held at the house of anthony hay on the   th washington went to the queens birth night at ye palace and on the next day left williamsburg the association is printed at large in burks history of virginia vol iii p     on comparing it with mr masons manuscript draft retained by washington i find it precisely the same except the addition of two short articles and the omission of another the following article contained in mr masons draft was left out by the burgesses if the measures already entered into should prove ineffectual and our grievances and oppressions should notwithstanding be continued then and in that case the subscribers will put a stop to their exports to europe of tar pitch turpentine timber lumber and skins and furs of all sorts and will endeavor to find some other employment for their slaves and other hands than cultivating tobacco which they will entirely leave off making and will enter into such regulations as may be necessary with regard to the rents and other tobacco debts—sparks your favor of the   th came to my hands this day the contents of which or the letter itself shall soon reach mr addisons hands in respect to the dancing gentry

exceedingly grien that the panels slipped out of the mouldings before it was two months in use split from one end to the other and became so open at the joints though every possible care was taken of it that i expect very little further service from it with all the repairs i can bestow besides this we frequently have slight goods and sometimes old and unsalable articles put off upon us and at such advanced prices that one would be inclined to think the tradesmen did not expect to be paid in haste for them for it is a fact incontestably true that linens and other articles that have their prices

in      sir william johnson to secure the friendship of the six nations invited them to send delegates to a general council at the german flats in the middle of july      the indians then offered to cede all their lands east of the ohio to the english for a fair consideration and croghan johnsons agent believed at the time that nothing but an acceptance of the offer could prevent a war the matter was not determined and the establishment of english settlements on the alleghanies and in the illinois country then largely held by french colonists tended to make the trade with the indians less profitable to prevent a further diminution of the profits a scheme was formed by govr franklin of new jersey for purchasing a large tract of territory on the ohio and forming permanent settlements upon it general gage governor moore and sir wm johnson were also interested in the scheme which was urged upon the british ministry by benj franklin in        the original idea comprehended a colony in the illinois but on submitting the plan to lord shelburne it was found that it did not quadrate with the sentiments of people here that their objections to it were the distance which would make it of little use to this country as the expense on the carriage of goods would oblige the people to manufacture for themselves that it would for the same reason be difficult both to defend it and to govern it that it might lay the foundation of a power in the heart of america which in time might be troublesome to the other colonies and prejudicial to our government over them and that people were wanted both here and in the already settled colonies so that none could be spared for a new colony franklin to wm franklin    september      general phineas lyman of conn who had served with bravery and distinction in the late war was in england urging the claims of the military adventures which were designed to cover the same territory as those of the franklin company and an effort was made to make the two schemes one in october      franklin could report that the plan had been approved in cabinet council and had been referred to the board of trade where it appears to have slept for some years without being acted upon there is little doubt wrote johnson to gov franklin in may      but that the intended settlement may be productive of a regular civil government in that valuable country and this too without doing violence or overreaching the indians which from sentiments of policy as well as justice should be always cautiously avoided the treaty of fort stanwix september      established the bounds of english territory essentially as they had been proposed at the german flats beginning at the mouth of the tennessee river it followed the ohio and alleghany rivers to kittaning thence in a direct line to the nearest fork of the west branch of the susquehannah and thence following that stream through the alleghames it passed by way of burnetts hills and the eastern branch of the susquehannah and the delaware into new york having its northern terminus at the confluence of canada and wood creeks the line thus proposed was not in accordance with the instructions of the board of trade hillsborough who had succeeded the liberal shelburne as colonial secretary and was bitterly opposed to any settlements in the interior wished to have the line extended no farther than the mouth of the great kenawha where it would then meet the line which stuart at a council in south carolina had recently established with the cherokees as the western boundary of virginia the temper however of the confederate deputies at this time rendered it impossible for the baronet to follow strictly his instructions without defeating the very object of the congress stone life of sir wm johnson ii  0  johnson claimed that the effect of this treaty which was ratified in    0 was to vest the claim of the northern indians to the country south of the ohio in the crown leaving the southern indians only to be dealt with concerning it and should they refuse to give it up it is in his majestys power to prevent the colonies from availing themselves of the late cession in that quarter till it can be done with safety and the common consent of all who have just pretensions to it johnson to gage    december      this plan reappears in london in    0 a society of us in which some of the first people in england are engaged and in which you and colonel croghan are made original partakers have concluded a bargain with the treasury for a large tract of land lying and fronting on the ohio part of the lands lately ceded by the indians to great britain large enough for a government having it suggested to us by lord hillsborough that it would be right that we should have a charter of government in consequence of this bargain so concluded we are next to apply to the council board that the grant may issue we expect to meet with opposition and some objections arising from the impressions made by such opposition yet have no doubt of carrying this point as we have settled the main point as soon as the grant has issued we are to apply to the lords of trade on the subject of the charter thomas pownall to sir william johnson april    0 the application for the grant was made in behalf of the company by thomas walpole a london banker benjamin franklin john sargent and samuel wharton but was opposed by lord hillsborough in a report that gave franklin an opportunity to make such a crushing reply as to lead to hillsboroughs resignation from the cabinet franklin works

establish the claims of the company he approached the organizers of the new company known as walpoles grant and sought to merge the interests of the two claimants this he accomplished as on may      0 the following agreement was made we the committee of the purchasers of a tract of country for a new province on the ohio in america do hereby admit the ohio company as a copurchaser with us for two shares of the said purchase equal to two seventysecond parts of the entire purchase in consideration of the engagement of their agent col mercer to withdraw the application of the said company for a separate grant within the limits of the said purchase this agreement was repudiated by the old company on the   th of december    0 mercer wrote to washington from dublin before i left england i mentioned my having agreed with or i may rather say prevailed with the great land company i e walpoles grant there that the two hundred thousand acres claimed by the officers of the virginia troops should be allowed out of their grant   major george muse had been accused of cowardice at the affair of the great meadows and his name was omitted in the vote of thanks to the officers by the legislature it was decided however that this person should have his share of the land and the following extract from a letter to him on this subject will show with what spirit and tone washington could retort upon rudeness when there was occasion george washington sir your impertinent letter was delivered to me yesterday as i am not accustomed to receive such from any man nor would have taken the same language from you personally without letting you feel some marks of my resentment i would advise you to be cautious in writing me a second of the same tenor but for your stupidity and sottishness you might have known by attending to the public gazette that you had your full quantity of ten thousand acres of land allowed you that is nine thousand and seventythree acres in the great tract and the remainder in the small tract but suppose you had really fallen short do you think your superlative merit entitles you to greater indulgence than others or if it did that i was to make it good to you when it was at the option of the governor and council to allow but five hundred acres in the whole if they had been so inclined if either of these should happen to be your opinion i am very well convinced that you will be singular in it and all my concern is that i ever engaged in behalf of so ungrateful a fellow as you are but you may still be in need of my assistance as i can inform you that your affairs in respect to these lands do not stand upon so solid a basis as you may imagine and this you may take by way of hint i wrote to you a few days ago concerning the other

merit the least assistance from me   washington addressed a similar letter to vanbraam and on the same day wrote to george mercer to purchase the right of stobo and vanbraam provided they will take a trifle for them my only motive for doing this is that the progress of our affairs may be less obstructed by being more contracted the whole trouble of late in this country i mean has fallen upon me and a good deal of expence which never has nor indeed never can be brought in to account i have been subjected to by my activity in this matter and as it is very obvious that the whole work must go on at the expence of a few or not at all i am inclined to adventure a little further in order to take the chance of gaining in proportion to my loss for no problem in euclid is more clear than that those who do not choose to advance beforehand whilst there is at least a hope of success will hardly draw their purse strings to reimburse the expences of others when even hope is departed from them    col cresap whom i have seen since his return from england gave it to me as his opinion that some of the shares in the new charter government on the ohio might be bought very cheap from some of the present members are you of this opinion who are they that would sell and at what price do you think a share could be bought i believe from what i have lately heard that there is no doubt now of the charter government taking place on the ohio but upon what terms or how the lands will be granted to the people i have not been able to learn i should be glad however if you would endeavor to keep the tract you surveyed for me till such time as we can tell where and how to apply for rights or if you did anything with mcmahan on my account i will abide by that as soon as the tract at the great meadows is enlarged i should be glad to have the surveys returnd to the office and to get a plat of it myself as i am determined to take a patent for it immediately i cannot hear of any reserve in favor of colo croghan for which reason i do not care to say anything more to him on the subject of a purchase untill matters are upon a more permanent footing since no disadvantage can follow to him after leaving him at liberty in my last letter to sell the tract he made me an offer of to anybody he pleased i should be glad however to hear from you how he goes on in his sales and what is said and thought of his claim in short what chance there appears to be of his getting it for i suppose his right to the lands he claims must either be confirmed or rejected by this time and known at pittsburg before

towards carolina in pursuit of this scheme purposing also to view the lands on ohio and to see mine there before they returned with their report to scotland—from an interleaved almanac in your letter you mention the american company of farmers in the west of scotland and i cannot but approve of their sending over skilled men to take up land for them before they bring their families here and they have just taken the method which you and others advised me to take and i would surely follow your advice but i could not prevail on my wife to stay a year behind me david allan and james whiteland the two commissioners from that company are now at my house and i hope they will rest with me for a week or two for i can easily accommodate them and their horses they are going now for north carolina to look for a large tract of land agreeably to their commission a large tract of land to the extent of   000 or  0000 acres all contiguous and conveniently situated and not yet occupied is not to be got in the middle provinces though they might hereabout get plenty of single plantations here and there for the farmers are many of them selling their plantations and going back to take up larger tracts i therefore advised them all i could to go to the ohio but they are afraid the settlers there will be too far from market or a landing place since i come to america i have learned to think that those who have got a rich soil in a favorable climate and who have got all the conveniences of life in great plenty may be happy enough though they have but little money and they may carry on a sort of inland trade among themselves by way of barter but those on the ohio will not long be under that necessity for i hear that money is already subscribed to improve the navigation by cuts into the ohio and besides the farmers in that rich country may easily get money by rearing large flocks of cows hogs and sheep which they may drive to philadelphia and the market towns of new york and maryland by my being here i see that much of that fine land on the ohio and mississippi will be quickly taken up though no person should come to it from scotland i see emigrants in crowds passing this way almost

much fitter for some years hence than now but having his own inclination the desires of his mother and the acquiescence of almost all his relatives to encounter i did not care as he is the last of the

left with you is insufficient to answer these purposes please to advise me thereof and i will remit the deficiency i am very sorry it was not in my power to see you whilst in these parts i thank you

incurring so great an expense not that i think he could have got conveniently  agreeably fixed in the college for less than what is charged on that account but then for the benefit of only three months residence there this might have been avoided—however as his discontinuance at it is an act of his own  much against my judgment he can only blame me if he blames at all for yielding too easily to his importunities supported by the concurrence of his relations—i could have wished sir you had been pleased to make a charge in the accot for your own trouble or that i knew what was customary

i am unable to determine i shall take it very kind in you therefore to resolve the following questions which i am persuaded you can do with precision by inquiring of such gentlemen as have been engaged in this business whether there is any difficulty in procuring these people in holland if so from whence does it proceed whether they are to be had at all times or at particular seasons only and when whether they are engaged previously to sending for them and in what manner or do ships take their chance after getting there upon what terms are they generally engaged and how much for each person do they commonly stand the importer landed at philadelphia is it customary to send an intelligent german in the ship that is to bring them do vessels ever go immediately to holland for them and if they do what cargoes do they carry or are they to go round and where in short what plan would be recommended to me by the knowing ones as best for importing a full freight say two or three hundred

earlier days of the session were occupied with matters connected with the indian outbreaks and the boundary disputes with pennsylvania but the news of the boston port bill closing that town to all foreign trade after june  st was soon known in virginia and in the then disturbed condition of public opinion could have but one effect infinite astonishment and equal resentment wrote a member of the assembly on the  0th have seized every one here and a resort to the expedient of      0 a general agreement to stop all trade with britain appeared probable the house is now pushing on the public business for which we are called here at this time but before we depart our measures will be settled and agreed on the plan is extensive it is wise and i hope under god it will not fail of success at the instance of the younger and more aggressive members of the assembly robert carter nicholas moved on may   th to appoint june  st as a day of fasting humiliation and prayer and that the burgesses attend church in a body on that day the motion was carried and the governor on the   th hearing that the fast was intended to prepare the minds of the people to receive other resolutions of the house presumably intended to still more inflame the whole country and instigate the people to acts that might rouse the indignation of the mother country against them with the unanimous consent of the council dissolved the assembly on the ground that the terms of the resolution reflected highly upon the king and parliament of great britain what these other resolutions might have been is shown by the paper prepared the day before dissolution by richard henry lee denouncing the closing of boston as a most violent and dangerous attempt to destroy the constitutional liberty and rights of all british america and proposing a general congress of the colonies to consider and determine on ways the most effectual to stop the exports from north america and for the adoption of such other measures as may be most decisive for securing the rights of america against the systematic plan formed for their destruction he was prevented from proposing these resolutions by many worthy members who wished to have the public business first finished and who were induced to believe from many conversations they had heard that there was no danger of a dissolution r h lee to samuel adams    june      that the general temper of the assembly was moderate is further shown by a letter from lord dunmore to the earl of dartmouth dated the   th i have heard from many of the dissolved members and i hope it is true that the house in general in the hasty manner the measure was proposed and agreed to did not advert to the whole force of the terms in which the order i transmit the appointment of a fast is conceived and that if it had it is believed a strong opposition would have been made to it and probably that it might have met a different fate on the morning after the dissolution the members of the late house of burgesses to the number of eightynine met in the long room of the raleigh tavern known as the apollo drew up an association reciting their grievances against great britain recommending the disuse of tea and east indian products—a measure directed against the east india company—making the cause of boston common to all the colonies and instructed the committee of correspondence to propose to the similar committees in the other colonies to appoint deputies to meet in congress at such place annually as should be most convenient there to deliberate on those general measures which the united interests of america may require jefferson records that nobody thought at that time of extending our association further to the total interruption of our commerce with great britain or if it was proposed by any which i dont recollect it was condemned by the general sense of the members who formed that association jefferson to a cary   december      indeed the moderate tone of what was done was not satisfactory to r h lee who was urging more decided steps the consequent conduct of the members was surely much too feeble in opposition to the very dangerous and alarming degree to which despotism had advanced so thinking i did propose to the dissolved members a plan of a general congress but they made a distinction between their then state and that when they were members of the house

purviance baltimore during the revolution     the meeting unanimously agreed to a circular letter from which the following extract is taken most of the gentlemen present seemed to think it absolutely necessary for us to enlarge our late association and that we ought to adopt the scheme of nonimportation to a very large extent but we were divided in our opinions as to stopping our exports we could not however being so small a proportion of our late associates presume to make any alteration in the terms of our general association and we resolved to invite all the members of the late house of burgesses to a general meeting in this city on the first day of august next we fixed this distant day in the hopes of accommodating the meeting to every gentlemans private affairs and that they might in the meantime have an opportunity of collecting the sense of their respective counties the inhabitants of this city were convened yesterday afternoon and most cheerfully acceded to the measure we had adopted the action of this assemblage led dunmore to remark that it gave too much cause to apprehend that the prudent views and the regard to justice and equity as well as loyalty and affection which is publicly declared by many of the families of distinction here will avail little against the turbulence and prejudice which prevail throughout the country it is however at present quiet lord dunmore to the earl of dartmouth   june      the day of fasting was observed throughout the colony the people met generally with anxiety and alarm in their countenances and the effect of the day

repay study they are reprinted in force   the poll here mentioned was for the election of delegates to the house of burgesses mr fairfax declined as he said chiefly because he thought he could not give satisfaction at that time for he should think himself bound to oppose strong measures and was in favor of petitioning and giving parliament a fair opportunity of repealing their obnoxious acts there are scarce any at alexandria he adds of my opinion and though the few i have elsewhere conversed with on the subject are so yet from them i could learn that many thought otherwise so that i believe i should at this time give general dissatisfaction and therefore it would be more proper to decline even upon this account as well as because it would necessarily lead me into great expenses which my circumstances will not allow   charles broadwater        july   went up to alexandria to a meeting of the inhabitants of this county dined at arrells and lodged at my own house   dined at doctr browns and returned home in the evening    went up to alexandria to the election where i was chosen together with major broadwater burgess staid all night to a ball    col mason came in the afternoon and staid all night    went up to alexandria to a meeting of the county returned in the evening   the inhabitants of fairfax county had assembled and appointed a committee for drawing up resolutions expressive of their sentiments on the great topics which agitated the country washington was chairman of this committee and moderator of the meetings held by the people an able report was prepared by the committee containing a series of resolutions which were presented at a general meeting of the inhabitants at the courthouse in fairfax county on the   th of july it is printed in forces american archives fourth series i     mr bryan fairfax who had been present on former occasions not approving all the resolutions absented himself from this meeting and wrote a long letter to the chairman stating his views and objections with the request that it should be publicly read   mr fairfax had written—i come now to consider a resolve which ought to be the most objected to as tending more to widen the breach and prevent a reconciliation than any other i mean that wherein the authority of parliament is almost in every instance denied something similar to this though more imprudent is the most exceptionable part of the conduct of some in new england it has been asserted in the house of commons that america has been gradually encroaching that as they have given up points we have insisted on more the fact is true as to encroachment but the reason assigned is wrong it is not because they have given up points but because they have not given them up that we out of resentment demand more than we at first thought of but however natural it is for people incensed to increase their claims and whatever our anger may induce us to say in calm deliberations we should not insist on any thing unreasonable we have all along submitted to the authority of parliament from the first settlement of the colonies i believe there never was an act of parliament disputed till the famous stamp act it is a maxim in law that all the acts made since the settlement of the colonies do not extend here unless the colonies are particularly named therefore all acts wherein they are included do extend here when the stamp act was repealed it was said and i did not hear it contradicted that the americans objected to internal taxes but not to external duties when the duty on tea was laid as an external duty we objected to it and with some reason because it was not for the regulation of trade but for the express purpose of raising a revenue this was deemed a small encroachment on our first demands some now object to the authority which has established and regulated the postoffice a very useful regulation others deny their authority in regard to our internal affairs if we go on at this rate it is impossible that the troubles of america should ever have an end whatever we may wish to be the case it becomes good subjects to submit to the constitution of their country whenever a political establishment has been settled it ought to be considered what that is and not what it ought to be to fix a contrary principle is to lay the foundation of continual broils and revolutions the parliament from prescription have a right to make laws binding on the colonies except those imposing taxes from prescription the americans are exempt from taxation let us stand upon good ground in our opposition otherwise many upon reflection may desert the cause therefore i hope some alteration will be made in the second resolve or that nothing under this head will be mentioned   among the alexandria resolves which were the subject of mr fairfaxs letter there was one for petitioning the king in relation to this he wrote—i hope it will be recommended that if a petition should be agreed upon and sent home by the general congress no conditional resolution which may be formed at the time should be published until it is known that the petition has had no effect for we should otherwise destroy the very intention of it to petition and to threaten at the same time seem to be inconsistent it might be of service with the ministry if they have evil designs to know the dispositions of the people here i am sure that sufficiently appears from what has already been published and if that appears no threatenings ought to accompany the petition it ought to be as modest as possible without descending to meanness there is one expression then in one of our resolves which i much object to that is a hint to the king that if his majesty will not comply there lies but one appeal this ought surely to be erased there are two methods proposed to effect a repeal the one by petition the other by compulsion they ought then to be kept separate and distinct and we shall find few for joining them together who are not rather against the former   in compliance with the recommendation of the deputies embodied in a circular issued from williamsburg on the   st of may delegates were chosen in

because of illness sent the paper that was later printed as a summary view of the rights of british america this definition of rights and grievances intended to serve as instructions for the delegates

letter was not read till i considered that i had no right to have it done as every one who chose it ought to have been present and till i perceived by your letter that the committee were against it if there had been no reason for refusing it but a persuasion that the sentiments contained in it were erroneous i dont think it would have been a just one i am satisfied with your reasons as i had no desire to make a party or oppose my opinion to that of a large majority i sent it down as i could not go in person without great inconvenience that i might not hereafter reproach myself with being silent on the occasion however i am inclined since the receipt of yours to think i am mistaken about the plan determined on at home you have no reason sir to doubt your opinion it is i that have reason to doubt mine where so many men of superior understanding think otherwise it has in fact caused me to examine it again and again but if i was not convinced of an error it appeared to me that it showed as much cowardice in a man not to maintain his opinions when real as obstinacy to persevere in them contrary to conviction mr williamson told me the other day that he found afterwards that there were a great many of his opinion in the court house who did not care to speak because they thought it would be to no purpose and it may be so because a person present when he was telling me so said he was at the meeting and did secretly object to some of the resolves but could not speak his mind that you may not think my sentiments quite so singular as they appeared to be i must observe that the second persons opinion i heard after the arrival of the boston port bill was mr daltons who asked me what i thought of it whether i did not think that the parliament were bound to do what they did or something like it to secure the trade of their merchants if the same outrage had been committed in any foreign port whether the government could have acquiesced without demanding and enforcing restitution or something to this purport and it really appeared to me then a distinct thing from enforcing the payment of the duty the next person whose opinion i heard was mr williamsons and the next mr hendersons with this difference that the bostonians ought to have destroyed the tea but should have sent home the payment for it immediately but that the government could not avoid taking the steps c he joined with me in opinion that the people at boston were blameable in their behavior in other respects and when i expressed my concern at the bill then talked of for altering their charter he observed that the measure might be necessary considering the factious conduct of the people they have all along appeared to me to shew a different spirit from the rest of the colonies and if ever we have a civil war i think without some check they will be at the head of it and i cant conceive any thing worse for america at present i know not whether mr henderson told me this in confidence or not in case he should i beg that you wont mention his opinion altho he dont reserve this caution by mentioning the word check i dont mean to approve of all or scarce one of the measures lately exercised on n england a charter should not be altered without the consent or consulting with the majority of the people or upon some very flagrant or violent occasions wherever the good of the whole is endangered but even then the consent of the whole ought to be obtained no constitution as i mentioned in my letter should be altered unless the consent of every part concerned can be had we have no right to alter our constitution without the consent of the king  parliament for the same reason none of our constitutions should be altered without our consent for the parliament according to the opinion of good civilians have no right to alter the constitution of england without taking or obtaining a sanction from the voice of the people if it could be had because the constitution is fixed when the peoples representatives are chosen and therefore they must act according to it and cant alter it it may possibly be for the good of the colony of massachusetts to alter the constitution governor hutchinson a native and a man of good character advised it it is true but he may have too arbitrary notions as the people who first went to settle chose such a form of government and obtained it they ought to be the best judges of the conveniences or inconveniences attending it i wish ours was altered with respect to the council but it is dangerous meddling in such matters it might be a bad precedent in troublesome times and as to ye act for transporting criminals to england for trial tho i wish every man could obtain strict justice and that no man in civil disputes should be tried till the passions of men have a little subsided i dislike it as much as any man but in regard to the boston port bill i own i have no objection to it except to the power given to the crown of shutting up the port after the tea may be paid for i can see no difference between demanding satisfaction first and sending a fleet to demand it with conditional orders to block up the port upon refusal or till satisfaction is made i own too that i have been inclined to think that the tea ought to have been paid for before the other colonies had joined in support of boston but i suppose i am wrong as so many others think otherwise however upon this occasion i cant help mentioning that at a very full meeting of gentlemen at york relating to the middlesex election there were only two one a namesake of mine who dissented from the whole assembly consequently their opinions were very unpopular and yet i have lived to see some coming over to their opinion and as strongly of their opinion two of them at least mr harrison and mr grayson as ever they were of a contrary one this example if this assembly were mistaken would serve to shew if there were not many instances in history where large bodies of men have been mistaken that a man however doubtful he may become when he perceives a great number to think otherwise ought not to be too hasty in giving up his opinion i have been uneasy to find that any one should look upon the letter sent down as repugnant to the principle we were contending for and therefore when you have leisure i shall take it as a favor if you will let me know wherein it was thought so i must make an apology for these long letters which i trouble you with i have scarce passed a day without anxious thoughts upon the subject i beg leave to look upon you as a friend and it is a great relief to unbosom ones thoughts to a friend besides the information and correction to my errors i may obtain from a correspondence is a great inducement to it for i am convinced that no man in the colony wishes its prosperity more would go greater lengths to serve it nor is at the same time a better subject to the crown pray excuse these compliments they may be tolerable in a friend i cant recollect any expression that could give any reason for the supposition just mentioned as to taxes i never was of opinion that the parliament had a right to impose them and hardly ever had a doubt upon the subject of their taking our money from us without our consent tho as to the duty on tea i never was so clear in opinion as to sign any paper in opposition to the right but as it is certainly unjust i may refuse to trade with a nation exercising that injustice even if the right was ever so clear but i dont remember that i mentioned any doubts upon the subject since i got so far i have been reading king jamess charters to the first virginia companys at the end of stiths history there is one expression in the  d charter a little different from the quotation of it which i have in the house and which i cant understand perfectly at least without considering a subsequent clause sect    and for their further encouragement of our special grace and favour we do by these presents for us our heirs and successors yield and grant to and with the said treasurer and company and their successors and every of them their factors and assigns that they and every of them shall be free of all subsidies and customs in virginia for the space of one  twenty years and from all taxes and impositions forever here the quotation stops upon any goods or merchandises at any time or times hereafter either upon importation thither or exportation from thence into our realm of england or into any other of our realms or dominions by the said treasurer and company and their successors c except only the five pounds pr cent due for custom upon all such goods and merchandises as shall be brought or imported into our realm of england or any other of these our dominions according to the ancient trade of merchants c in the   st sect are these words after directing what duties strangers and foreigners are to pay over and above such subsidy and custom as the said treasurer and company or their successors is or hereafter shall be to pay and the same sums of money and benefit as aforesaid for and during the space of one and twenty years shall be wholly employed to the benefit use and behoof of the said colony and plantation and after the said one and twenty years ended the same shall be taken to the use of us our heirs and successors by such officers and ministers as by us our heirs and successors shall be thereunto assigned and appointed as is specified in the said former letters patents i shall be glad of your opinion upon this if you would read over all the charters anew some thoughts might occur on both sides of the question the distinction that was made some years ago in the colonies between the right to impose duties for the regulation of trade which has been allowed and the right to impose duties for raising a revenue i dont understand so well as i wish to do tho i can see a great difference between the propriety or justice in laying a small duty or duties for the former purpose and a declared or apparent intention to raise a considerable revenue by degrees there is a new opinion now lately advanced in virginia that the parliament has no right to make any or scarce any laws binding on the colonies it has given me much uneasiness for altho i wish as much as any one that we were legally exempted from it yet i hold it clearly that we ought to abide by our constitution the common consent and acquiescence in the colonies for such a length of time is to us a clear proof of their having a right and altho it is said that it has only been exercised in matters of trade it will be found to be a mistake the act for the alteration of the style was unquestionably received and assented to the act for the regulation of the postoffice i mean the first act the act empowering officers to enlist servants just imported and to pay for them the acts relating to the provincial troops the late war c have no relation to trade but they were enacted when the act of any single assembly could not have answered the end and upon these occasions they have been passed without the least objection that ever i heard to the contrary when i first heard the subject of taxation mentioned a tax was talked of to be laid by parliament on the lands in america colo mason who was present spoke as much as usual upon the subject upon the impropriety i believe of taxing infant colonies and the nature or excessiveness of it compared to the value of lands c but i did not hear him make one objection as to the right of parliament when i came afterwards to hear the right called in question i recollected the conversation and was surprised that i had not heard a man of his understanding and readiness to find fault with every thing irregular take notice of it and tho he may not have considered the matter as a new point yet it is a proof that the idea of the parliament having no right to make any laws for us had not ever entered into his mind before i saw colo richard henry lee act as justice of the peace under the act relating to servants and insist upon the right he had to act on shipboard because the act of parliament had given power to all justices in america to act without confining them to their respective counties i have often heard mention made of uniting some of the colonies by act of parliament of some in pennsylvania having thoughts of petitioning to have their charter abrogated and a new government formed and all this without any objection to the right which looks to me like a common consent but i am almost unwilling to advance any opinion now i should not but in hopes that you will give me yours upon this point by the first charter granted to virginia the council were to govern the colony according to such laws ordinances and instructions as they were to receive from the crown by the second charter they were to be governed by such laws orders c as should be made by the council for the colony appointed in and to reside in london who were to make ordain and establish all manner of laws orders directions instructions forms and ceremonies of government and magistracy fit and necessary for the said colony and the first government was annulled pursuant to these charters and the third the council and company in england made an ordinance for holding an assembly in virginia with power to make laws in the year      with a proviso that no law made was to be in force till it had obtained their assent at home when i have considered these disputes i have often wished to know the sentiments of the first settlers here in capt smiths history there is mention of taxes by the parliament and some one in virginia makes the same objections to it as we do at this day much about the same time i perceive that the assembly had petitioned the parliament for relief they thought themselves illused by the king i am mistaken in saying that the assembly petitioned it was the company at home petitioned being encouraged it is said by the parliament having taken the case of the plantation tobacco into consideration the assembly petitioned the king to continue and even farther to confirm the government under which they then lived but if the government must be altered they desired c and in their letter to the lords of the council they expressed a desire that the governors sent over might not have absolute authority but might be restrained to the consent of the council and that they might still retain the liberty of their general assemblies this was the style and situation of our ancestors in the infancy of the colony the english government was a long time arriving to maturity also i dont think the constitution was properly settled till the revolution and then immediately were sown the seeds of its ruin the parliament then first began to borrow money and consume in one year the amount of some years taxes and within ten or twelve years corruption was introduced in order to keep out the tory interest i am very sorry we happen to differ in opinion i hope however that our sentiments will again coincide as in other matters i wish they could with regard to storing the goods perhaps it is only intended as a threat to the merchants but if it is otherwise and they should send any over i am afraid that we should lie at the mercy or generosity of those merchants whether they will apply to government for troops to release their goods or not if the end could be answered otherwise it would be better if there was virtue enough in the country to abstain from only half the goods commonly consumed it might probably answer in a few years if every man of influence would encourage his neighbor to persevere perhaps we might hold out especially if the names of those merchants should be published who sell or import contrary to the desire of the general sense of the country as it might prevent others from doing the like i am sorry to hear what you mention of general gage i did not imagine he has been so weak as to call resolutions not to trade with great britain by the name of treason i must again apologies for this letter hoping youl excuse it and believe that i am c—bryan fairfax to washington towlston

subsisted between them mackenzie had obtained a commission in the regular army and was now attached to the fortythird regiment of foot he was wounded at the battle of bunkers hill while fighting in that regiment he wrote as follows to washington from boston    september     — mr atchison can sufficiently inform you of the state of this unhappy province of their tyrannical oppression over one another of their fixed aim at total independence of the weakness and temper of the mainsprings that set the whole in motion and how necessary it is that abler heads and better hearts should draw a line for their guidance even when this is done t is much to be feared that they will follow it no further than where it coincides with their present sentiments amidst all these jarrings we have until lately lived as in a camp of pleasure but the rebellious and numerous meetings of men in arms their scandalous and ungenerous attacks upon the best characters in the province obliging them to save their lives by flight and their repeated but feeble threats to dispossess the troops have furnished sufficient reasons to general gage to put the town in a formidable state of defence about which we are now fully employed and which will be shortly accomplished to their great mortification   at that congress the first continental washington had appeared as one of the representatives of virginia but apparently not yet clear as to what extent it was proper to involve himself in the difficulties into which massachusetts was plunged there is reason to suppose that he shared somewhat in the distrust generally felt south of new england of the purposes of the massachusetts leaders whilst in this state of mind he received a letter from captain mackenzie mackenzie was a native of virginia and an acquaintance of washington who had taken a commission in the british army and was at this time attached to one of the regiments stationed at boston the object of the letter was to prejudice his mind against the action of the people of massachusetts and to induce him to exert his influence to counteract the policy their delegates were advocating in philadelphia determined to satisfy himself as to the true character and designs of these delegates he seems to have sought an interview and free conference with them at their lodgings that interview took place on the evening of the   th of september      page     ante richard henry lee and dr shippen of philadelphia were also present it seems to have settled all washingtons doubts if he had any for instead of noisy brawling demagogues meaning mischief only he found the delegates plain downright practical men seeking safety from oppression and contemplating violence only as a result of an absolute necessity forced on them by the

account and excuse me for my not having acknowledged your lordships several letters in due time and order and for not having regularly communicated accounts of the public affairs of the colony to which some of them refer and i wish i were now so fortunate as to have it in my power to make a representation of their appearing with a more favorable aspect than when i last wrote upon these important concerns the associations first in part entered into recommended by the people of this colony and adopted by what is called the continental congress are now enforcing throughout this country with the greatest rigor a committee has been chosen in every county whose business it is to carry the association of the congress into execution which committee assumes to inspect the books invoices and all other secrets of the trade and correspondence of merchants to watch the conduct of every inhabitant without distinction and to send for all such as come under their suspicion into their presence to interrogate them respecting all matters which at their pleasure they think fit objects of their inquiry and to stigmatize as they term it such as they find transgressing what they are now hardy enough to call the laws of the congress which stigmatising is no other than inviting the vengeance of an outrageous and lawless mob to be exercised upon the unhappy victims every county besides is now arming a company of men whom they call an independent company for the avowed purpose of protecting their committees and to be employed against government if occasion require the committee of one county has proceeded so far as to swear the men of their independent company to execute all orders which shall be given them from the committee of their county as to the power of government which your lordship in your letter no    directs should be exerted to counteract the dangerous measures pursuing here i can assure your lordship that it is entirely disregarded if not wholly overturned there is not a justice of peace in virginia that acts except as a committee man the abolishing the courts of justice was the first step taken in which the men of fortune and preeminence joined equally with the lowest and meanest the general court of judicature of the colony is much in the same predicament for though there is at least a majority of his majestys council who with myself are the judges of that court that would steadily perform their duty yet the lawyers have absolutely refused to attend nor indeed would the people allow them to attend or evidences to appear the reason commonly assigned for this proceeding is the want of a fee bill which expired the last session of assembly and it is a popular argument here that no power but the legislature can establish fees and the fee bill not having been renewed is attributed to the dissolution but the true cause of so many persons joining in so opprobrious a measure was to engage their english creditors who are numerous to join in the clamors of this country and not a few to avoid paying the debts in which many of the principal people here are much involved with regard to the encouraging of those as your lordship likewise exhorts me who appeared in principle averse to these proceedings i hope your lordship will do me the justice to believe i have left no means in my power unessayed to draw all the assistance possible from them to his majestys government but i presume your lordship will not think it very extraordinary that my persuasions should have been unavailing against the terrors which on the other hand are held out by the committee independent companies c so universally supported who have set themselves up superior to all other authority under the auspices of their congress the laws of which they talk of in a stile of respect and treat with marks of reverence which they never bestowed on their legal government or the laws proceeding from it i can assure your lordship that i have discovered no instance where the interposition of government in the feeble state to which it is reduced could serve any other purpose than to suffer the disgrace of a disappointment and thereby afford matter of great exultation to its enemies and increase their influence over the minds of the people but my lord every step which has been taken by these infatuated people must inevitably defeat its own purpose their nonimportation nonexportation c cannot fail in a short time to produce a scarcity which will ruin thousands of families the people indeed of fortune may supply themselves and their negroes for two or three years but the middling and poorer sort who live from hand to mouth have not the means of doing so and the produce of their lands will not purchase those necessaries without which themselves and negroes must starve of the merchants who may have goods to dispose of because the merchants are prevented from turning such produce to any account as to manufacturing for themselves the people of virginia are very far from being naturally industrious and it is not by taking away the principal if not the only encouragement to industry that it can be excited nor is it in times of anarchy and confusion that the foundation of such improvements can be laid the lower class of people too will discover that they have been duped by the richer sort who for their part elude the whole effects of the association by which their poor neighbors perish what then is to deter those from taking the shortest mode of supplying themselves and unrestrained as they are by laws from taking whatever they want wherever they can find it the arbitrary proceedings of these committees likewise cannot fail producing quarrels and dissensions which will raise partisans of government and i am firmly persuaded that the colony even by their own acts and deeds must be brought to see the necessity of depending on its mother country and of embracing its authority—dunmore to the earl of

argued closely profoundly and warmly on the same side the post in the revolutionary debate belonging to him was that at which the theories of republicanism were deposited washington was prominent

washington was now attending the second continental congress which assembled in philadelphia on the  0th of may   elected commanderinchief of the continental army while the appointment of washington to the command of the continental army appears a natural one when regarded from a military standpoint—as he was about the only man of american birth in the colonies who could lay claim to any extensive military experience—the political reasons that controlled the choice were by no means unimportant the contest between the colonies and the mother country had naturally centred in the colony of the massachusetts bay and boston had in consequence assumed the leading part when hostilities had actually begun and the siege of boston attempted the provincial congress was met by the serious question of how to maintain control and utilize the force that had so suddenly been collected and looked to it for commands to continue the men in service for any time was more than the congress could accomplish and to disband them would defeat their cause and ruin their character with the other colonies from which aid was expected it was thus very natural that the provincial congress should turn to the continental congress and seek advice and assistance there existed reasons however why this advice and active aid should not be at once granted i have already quoted what mr charles francis adams believed of one of the most characteristic as well as important productions that remain to give an insight into his washingtons mind page     ante other evidences are at hand of a little jealousy subsisting on the part of the southern colonies of the new england provinces dating from a very early period of the contest the people of boston it was said do affect to dictate and take the lead in continental measures and were apt from an inward vanity and selfconceit to assume big and haughty airs hawley to john adams    july      even general gage intimated that to persuade the other colonies to make the cause of boston the common cause of america the delegates from massachusetts to the general congress would probably pay the rest the compliment of taking their advice gage to the earl of dartmouth  0 july      it was to a virginia delegate peyton randolph that the post of honor in the congress was given and the efforts of the boston representatives were exerted to remove distrust and were in a measure crowned with success heretofore we have been accounted by many intemperate and rash but now we are universally applauded as cool and judicious as well as spirited and brave this is the character we sustain in congress there is however a certain degree of jealousy in the minds of some that we aim at total independency not only of the mother country but of the colonies too and that as we are a hardy and brave people we shall in time overrun them samuel adams to joseph warren    september      in the second congress adams found that this jealousy was directed against a new england army commanded by a new england general and that to gain the aid of the congress or induce it to assume the maintenance regulation and direction of the motley force then collected before boston the point of command must be yielded writing many years after the event he recalls that some of the leading sons of liberty in philadelphia took pains to warn him and his colleagues to be moderate and to recognize the lead of virginia—the colony doubtless that had exhibited the most marked jealousy if not suspicion of the motives of the new england provinces again was randolph unanimously chosen to the chair but in a few days was obliged to return to virginia to open the session of the assembly hancock of massachusetts was elected to the vacancy—presumably a political choice—and soon the affairs of the continent rendered doubly momentous by the shedding of blood at lexington pressed upon the attention of congress washington it is recorded by john adams works i     was attending the sessions of congress in military uniform—blue and buff proceedings of the massachusetts historical society january      this action was as mr charles francis adams suggests an announcement that his mind was made up and as it were an unconscious nomination of himself for a command the massachusetts and virginia delegates were at this time working together this unity being secured mainly through the intimacy existing between the two adamses and richard henry lee on june  d a letter from the massachusetts provincial congress was laid before the continental body asking advice respecting the institution of a civil government in the colony and also suggesting that as the army then collecting from different colonies was for the general defence of the rights of america the regulation and direction of it were proper subjects for continental action force american archives fourth series ii     it is not known whether the question of command was connected with this suggestion and mr c f adams regards the appointment by the provincial congress of artemas ward to the chief command on the day after this letter was written as an indication that it was not i am inclined to believe however that this appointment of ward was not intended to forestall any nomination by the continental congress but was local in its nature for he was to command only the forces raised by the congress from which he received his commission the issuing of the commission was deemed expedient the conception of a continental army was probably then forming as the new york delegates in the continental congress wrote on june   to the provincial assembly about the command of the continental army in our province as general officers will in all probability be shortly appointed by this congress so again on the  th the provincial congress wrote in reply the colonies of massachusetts and connecticut have formed their respective armies and nominated to the general command of them the supposition that in case a continental army should be established by authority of your respectable body their officers will be permitted to preserve their respective ranks appears to us highly probable it does not follow that the matter had as yet been formally brought before congress force american archives fourth series ii               james warren had already hinted the name of washington to john adams for the command they the army seem to want a more experienced direction i could for myself wish to see your friends washington and l ee at the head of it and yet dare not propose it though i have it in contemplation   may      step by step the idea of continental control gained force and matters were in train for the nomination of officers the southern delegates were in favor of washington but even some of the members from virginia were very cool about his appointment while pendleton was very clear and full against it furthermore the new england delegates were divided in opinion an embarrassment that adams believed was never publicly known it was however soon known to gage for he wrote to the earl of dartmouth on october   th of much division in the congress jealousy of the eastern delegates owing to which washington was appointed to the chief command of the rebel army weary of waiting and convinced that a concession must be made john adams determined to bring the matter to a head by moving that congress should adopt the army before boston and appoint colonel washington commander of it accordingly when congress had assembled i rose in my place and in as short a speech as the subject would admit represented the state of the colonies the uncertainty in the minds of the people their great expectation and anxiety the distresses of the army the danger of its dissolution the difficulty of collecting another and the probability that the british army would take advantage of our delays march out of boston and spread desolation as far as they could go i concluded with a motion in form that congress would adopt the army at cambridge and appoint a general that though this was not the proper time to nominate a general yet as i had reason to believe this was a point of the greatest difficulty i had no hesitation to declare that i had but one gentleman in my mind for that important command and that was a gentleman from virginia who was among us and very well known to all of us a gentleman whose skill and experience as an officer whose independent fortune great talents and excellent universal character would command the approbation of all america and unite the cordial exertions of all the colonies better than any other person in the union mr washington who happened to sit near the door as soon as he heard me allude to him from his usual modesty darted into the library room    mr samuel adams seconded the motion    the subject came under debate and several gentlemen declared themselves against the appointment of mr washington not on account of any personal objection against him but because the army were all from new england had a general of their own appeared to be satisfied with him and had proved themselves able to imprison the british army in boston which was all they expected or desired at that time mr pendleton of virginia mr sherman of connecticut were very explicit in declaring their opinion mr cushing and several others more faintly expressed their opposition and their fears of discontents in the army and in new england mr paine expressed a great opinion of general ward and a strong friendship for him having been his classmate at college or at least his contemporary but gave no opinion upon the question the subject was postponed to a future day in the meantime pains were taken out of doors to obtain a unanimity and the voices were generally so clearly in favor of washington that the dissentient members were persuaded to withdraw their opposition and mr washington was nominated i believe by mr thomas johnson of maryland unanimously elected and the army adopted adams works ii        the choice was made on thursday june   th and on the next day washington was notified of his election and accepted in the modest speech printed above it was soon apparent that the opinion of washington entertained by many of the staunchest members of congress had been adopted in massachusetts where the inactivity and almost incompetency of general ward to meet the emergency were leading the provincial congress to look elsewhere for a commander i should heartily rejoice to see this way the beloved colonel washington and do not doubt the new england generals would acquiesce in showing to our sister colony virginia the respect which she has before experienced from the continent in making him generalissimo this is a matter in which dr warren agrees with me and we had intended to write you jointly on the affair james warren to john adams   june      the letter may have reached philadelphia before the choice had been made the battle of bunkers hill only served to increase the feeling against the provincial general fine fellows you know our countrymen are and want nothing but a general of spirit and abilities to make them a fine army all our efforts which are many cannot supply that defect—yours must do it could you believe he ward never left his house on saturday but i shall add no more i wish that was the worst of it warren to samuel adams    june      and to john adams he wrote had our brave men posted on ground injudiciously at first taken had a lee or a washington instead of a general destitute of all military ability and spirit to command them it is my opinion the day would have terminated with as much glory to america as the   th of april this is our great misfortune and it is remediless from any other quarter than yours we dare not supercede him here—it will come well from you and really merits your attention  0 june      on the same day the massachusetts provincial congress wrote to the continental congress we beg leave humbly to suggest that if a commander in chief of the army of the united colonies should be appointed it must be plain to your honors that no part of this continent can so much require his immediate presence and exertions as this colony while we find the suggestion of washington for the command among both the southern members and in massachusetts it would not be a correct statement to assert that he was chosen in obedience to a general demand the act was rather due to the efforts of a few of the more far sighted leaders of the revolution in which colonial pride and jealousy played not an unimportant part the political effect of the appointment was clearly recognized by some i can now inform you that the congress have made choice of the modest and virtuous the amiable generous and brave george washington esquire to be general of the american army and that he is to repair as soon as possible to the camp before boston this appointment will have a great effect in cementing and securing the union of these colonies john adams    june      george washington a delegate from virginia is at the particular request of the people in new england and with the unanimous consent of the congress appointed commander in chief of the continental forces with a handsome salary per annum the commission he received with pleasure but positively refused any pay requiring only a reimbursement of his actual expenses letter dated philadelphia  0 june      in force american archives fourth series ii  0   there are some personal records of the appointment that do not lack interest there is something charming to me in the conduct of washington a gentleman of one of the first fortunes upon the continent leaving his delicious retirement his family and friends sacrificing his ease and hazarding all in the cause of his country his views are noble and disinterested he declared when he accepted the mighty trust that he would lay before us an exact account of his expenses and not accept a shilling for pay john adams to elbridge gerry    june      samuel adams speaks of our patriotic general washington to gerry    june and hancock recovering from his chagrin at being passed over could say he is a fine man to gerry    june in the camp at cambridge the appointment was gracefully accepted and his conduct after his arrival greatly increased the esteem in which he was held and prevented much of that discontent which it was feared would follow the supercession of the provincial generals greene life of greene i  0  as a curiosity i give the following memorandum— when congress determined to be independent and appointed general officers to command our armies to prosecute the war for independence and defending our liberty they nominated genl washington to the chief command but his great modesty recommended genl lewis in preference to himself but one of his colleagues from virginia observed that genl lewiss popularity had suffered much from the declamation of some of his troops on the late expedition against the indians and it would be impolitick at that juncture to make the appointment narrative of captain john stuart magazine of american history        0   as soon as he could get himself in readiness he set out for boston to take upon him the command of the army before

connecticut troops gates was at his seat in berkeley county virginia but speedily joined the army lee was a colonel on halfpay in the british army but he resigned his commission by a formal letter to the secretary at war as soon as he was appointed majorgeneral by the congress and before he received a commission in the american army he had been a soldier from his youth and had seen much service in america during the french war and afterwards in europe when he received this appointment he had been only about eighteen months in the colonies but that time had mostly been spent in travelling he thus formed many acquaintances and inspired the public with a high opinion of his military character his friend gates had induced him to buy lands in virginia beyond the blue ridge where he sometimes resided gates also had been an officer in the british army he was a captain at braddocks defeat where he was wounded and he rose afterwards to the rank of major which he resigned and retired from the service purchasing lands and settling himself as a planter in virginia a friendly intercourse had long subsisted between him and washington he was appointed adjutantgeneral by the congress at the

determine whether he will continue his proposed route or not on the day before june   d the new york congress had requested col lasher whom jones describes as a german shoemaker to send one of his field officers to meet general washington and to know when he will be in this city and to make such orders as to have his battalion ready to receive gen washington when he shall arrive on the receipt of general schuylers letter the congress ordered thomas smith john sloss hobart gouverneur morris and richard montgomery to go immediately to newark and recommend to general washington the place which they shall think most prudent for him to cross at some precaution was necessary as the province was still intensely loyal the provincial congress where the revolutionary spirit might be supposed to have centered was then discussing a plan of accommodation with great britain and on this very day information was received that the royal governor tryon had arrived at the hook and might land at one oclock how to pay the due respect to both the general and the governor was a question that could be determined only by a proper amount of trimming but little creditable to the congress colonel lasher was called in and requested to send one company of the militia to paulus hook to meet the generals that he have another company at the side of the ferry for the same purpose that he have the residue of his battalion ready to receive the general or governor tryon which ever shall first arrive and to wait on both as well as circumstances will allow provincial congress june   th fortunately for the congress circumstances were favorable to this double arrangement as washington landed a sufficient time before tryon to permit an escort for both last sunday about two oclock the generals washington
