a dialogue between a protesting catholic dissenter and a catholic on the nature tendency and import of the oath lately offered to the catholics of england  by the rev william pilling  london printed by j p coghlan no    dukestreet grosvenorsquare mdccxc  preface the following dialogue it is hoped may be of some service to many well meaning catholics we are called upon to take an oath which our pastors have pronounced inadmissible their sentence is called in question an appeal has been made to the catholics at large against the censure of the bishops the grounds of this appeal have been repeatedly offered to the public it will not then be improper to state the reasons against the oath that an impartial public may have every information necessary to form a judgment a dialogue was thought the most candid method of examining the merits of the cause for therein the unbiassed reader may weigh the grounds of both sides of the question and six his principles accordingly it will easily be discovered to whom the author wishes victory but he is not conscious of having omitted any reason of weight on the other side or of proposing any of them in a weak manner  these sheets would have been offered to the public some time back had they not been withheld from an apprehension of augmenting discord and widening the fatal breach which subsists at present among english catholics it was said that time and reflection would cool the ardour of protesting catholic dissenters as they are pleased to style themselves and that they would in time abandon a plan which they found reprobated by a great majority of the body if they were not rendered obstinate by resistance this expectation is now proved vain the pamphlets which every day appear in defense of the favorite system are a clear proof that nothing less than the most resolute opposition can reclaim them to their duty the complexion of these pamphlets is a demonstration against the cause in favor of which they are printed if a system cannot be defended but on the grounds of schism and heresy it can not be orthodox the two first which appeared dated moorfields breathe throughout insult and outrage against our worthy prelates and the vicar of christ the first in particular contains doctrines evidently heretical condemned as such by universities popes and councils the direct object of the last publication is a schismatical separation from the sea of rome  the author of these sheets had prepared for the press a full confutation of the laymans letter on the election of bishops but he found the work done by abler hands mr plowden has refuted this layman in a masterly manner though not so fully as could be wished from a person so well qualified for the undertaking mr millner however has followed the layman through all the mazes of his mangled quotations and effectually driven him from every post  what still remains to be done is to show this layman and others some of the rights of the primacy he and many others have so long been attentive to what the pope is not that they forget what he is it may not therefore be amiss to inform them it is worth remarking that this layman seems to bear no greater respect to a general council than he does to his holiness in his note page   he asserts that the canons of the council of trent give too great an authority to the pope we shall next be told that this council has established a lamentable abuse which has disfigured the religion of christ what could luther have added to this  that christ our redeemer gave to st peter the power of the keys matthew xvi and committed to him the care of his flock john xxi are gospel truths that the roman pontiff succeeded to this power and care is a fact equally admitted by all succeeding ages this is evident from the unanimous consent of councils and fathers nor does this layman as yet seem to deny it here then we are agreed but his opinion about the extent of these powers is a dissent from catholic doctrine i shall then show him some few unexceptionable vouchers and establish the catholic doctrine of the primacy beyond a reply i shall not produce those authorities which only prove the roman pontiff to be primate or first bishop in the church this he will not deny but such only as have some connection with the present dispute and show that this power is extended much farther than this layman is aware of  in the definition of faith of both greeks and latins in the council of florence is the following passage we define that the holy apostolical see and the roman pontiff holds the primacy over the whole world and that the roman pontiff is the successor of b peter the prince of the apostles and the true vicar of christ the head of the whole church and that he is the father and teacher of all christians and that to him in the person of peter was granted by our lord jesus christ a full power of feeding directing and governing the whole church as is contained in the acts of general councils and the sacred canons the ordinary jurisdiction therefore of the sea of rome extends as wide as the church itself  this remark is almost in so many words defined in the fifth council of lateran  the roman church by the appointment of our lord holds the primacy of ordinary power over all others churches  not to tire this laymans patience with quotations from councils and fathers i shall only add a few from among the french whose authority will be of greater weight as they are the less suspected of giving too great authority to the pope as the council of trent has done in the assembly of the gallican clergy      it is said of the pope he is the head of the church and the center of unity he holds over us the primacy of authority and jurisdiction committed to him by jesus christ in the person of st peter whoever dissents from the truth would be a schismatic and even an heretic  in      the  th of january the same clergy speaking of the power of bishops says jesus christ by his own appointment has prescribed limits to this power which he has granted to the successors of the apostles this he has subjected to the chair of st peter where he has placed the plenitude of apostolic authority  in      they had almost translated the words of the council of florence which they quoted and then they proceed who that is orthodox can doubt but that he the pope by this quality of primate in cases and according to the forms of law can provide for or inspect over the government of every diocese and all the pastoral functions which are necessary for the good of souls  perhaps mr bossuet will weigh as much in this laymans opinion as any author on the earth let us then hear him let des card archev and eveq edit      page    a power which is given to many carries its own restriction by its being divided whereas the power given to only one st peter and over all others and without exception carries with it a plenitude of power not being divided with any other it has no limits but these which are fixed by rule for this reason our ancient doctors of paris with one voice have always acknowledged in the chair of peter the fullness of apostolic authority this point is decided and finished they only demanded that the exertions of this authority shall be regulated by the canons that is by the common laws of the whole church and again thou art a rock and on this rock i will build my church and i will give thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven thou who have the authority of preaching the faith shall also have the keys which denote the authority of government whatever thou shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatever thou shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven all is subjected to these keys the king and his people the pastors and their flocks we publish it with joy because we love unity our obedience is our boast the command of loving more than other apostles was first given to peter then that of feeding and governing all the lambs and the sheep the young and their mothers the pastors themselves pastors with regard to the people but sheep in relation to peter in whom they honor jesus christ i shall finish with one more quotation from the gallican clergy in the before mentioned collection page     it is necessary according to the catholic faith to acknowledge in the sovereign pontiff a primacy of honor and jurisdiction also as has been acknowledged from the first ages of the church this jurisdiction is not barely of ecclesiastical right it is of divine right by the institution of jesus christ a jurisdiction in virtue of which the decrees of the sovereign pontiff concern all the churches and each one in particular and each of the bishops considers it as one of his most essential duties to respect the pope as his superior to swear obedience to him to have recourse to his authority in so many occasions and to be subject to him according to canonical ordination  from all these i find that the sovereign pontiff holds by the express appointment of christ a primacy not only of honor and preeminence but of jurisdiction also in virtue of which he is the ordinary universal pastor of all the faithful in the church whether laity clergy or bishops he has then a right inherent in his office of preaching teaching and governing in every spiritual concern the whole christian world and every christian is bound to submit to his mandates in matters of religion this jurisdiction is not limited or confined but by the canons of the church even according to the principles of the gallican church which never yet prevaricated as the council of trent did now to make this doctrine more explicit in the present debate i shall point out necessary consequences admitted by french divines as priveleges inherent in the primacy i hope dr hook will suffice for the rest as he cannot be suspected of granting any one prerogative to the pope which he did not think of divine origin had this layman ever read the doctors pricipia i presume he would not have advanced so many errors  vol   page  0  his proposition is  the roman pontiff in virtue of the primacy can and ought to watch with authority over the observance and propagation of the catholic faith and the execution of the canons and customs appertaining to universal discipline this however with dependence on the whole order of pastors  page     corol   the roman pontiff by virtue of his primacy is the center of catholic communion  page     corol   therefore the roman pontiff has in the church a legislative executive and judiciary power and his decisions concerning faith and universal discipline pronounced according to the usual forms required by the canons have the force of law unless through the opposition of the bishops they should not be accepted and thus be abolished  on this head the doctor has ibidem  if a controversy arises about faith the sovereign pontiff has a right   to declare what is precisely the catholic doctrine in the present controversy and to condemn the doctrine which is contrary to catholic faith   he has also a right to approve of those doctrines which are consistent with catholic faith although they do not appertain to faith itself and to condemn those which are not conformable to faith   he has a right to approve of those forms of speech expressions which are consonant to faith and to condemn those which are not  nb we have heard much reasoning in favor of the oath because it is not contrary to faith as if nothing but direct faith itself should be attended to the doctor goes on page     if a controversy arises about discipline the roman pontiff has a right   to declare which canons or customs are received by the practice of all the churches and to condemn those who will not observe such canons and customs   to condemn or rescind whatever is done or introduced among christians which he judges not consistent with faith or catholic discipline   he can ordain or command whatever he thinks necessary or greatly conducive to the execution of the canons or the preservation of faith  in a word the roman pontiff as primate of the church can enact decrees in all those concerns which are subject to the decisions of the church all these things not only evidently follow from the foregoing conclusion but are moreover confirmed by perpetual practice it would carry me too far to produce examples  page     cor   the roman pontiff in virtue of the primacy can receive appeals from all particular sentences concerning faith and general discipline and in facts which might injure either  corol   the roman pontiff in virtue of the primacy can validly dispense with the execution of the general canons received in all the churches when a sufficient reason demands it but not without cause at his bare will and pleasure  page   0 he expressly mentions the right of sending legates or appointing vicars of his pontifical authority  i do not wish to swell this preface with unnecessary comments on these plain words a denial of any one right evidently inherent in the primacy is to deny the primacy itself and consequently heretical let any one judge from this what sentence should be pronounced on the late publications in favor of the oath should any future occasion require it this subject shall be treated more at large  i expect to be called to an account for publishing these sheets for it will be said these publications only irritate mens minds and make ill worse to this i shall answer in the words of the late worthy archbishop of paris quoted by the cardinal archbishop of mechlin in his declaration of last year it is therefore true that popes and councils bishops of the most eminent sanctity and the martyrs have always reclaimed against the laws of silence which confound truth with error laws favorable to heresy but pernicious to religion laws which are an inexhaustible source of persecution and insults against catholies because the attention to enforce such laws is always sixth upon the faithful but leaves heretics at liberty to violate them with impunity we are advised to be silent but are our adversaries silent have we not had a constant succession of incendiary publications to the great scandal of religion and the manifest danger of a schism in the church it is high time to repel these dangerous attacks and i hope to see every catholic who has talents to defend his religion step forth and show to the world that neither the fear of losing the favor of the great nor even threats of persecution can deter him from the defense of truth and orthodoxy  should it be said that i ought to have substituted an oath in place of that of the committee which would satisfy all parties i answer that however easy the task it is not the business of a private person this should be done by the bishops let them be consulted and without doubt they will soon compose our differences and satisfy government also if the heads of administration only wish to secure our allegiance if any thing more is demanded it should not be granted  a dialogue between a protesting catholic dissenter and a catholic pcd the present disputes about the oath of allegiance have raised strange commotions throughout the kingdom among the catholics i fear we shall be a divided people pray sir let you and i discuss the matter together perhaps we may clear the difficulty by explaining our meaning   c i sincerely wish something of this sort had been done some time back i am persuaded that a candid and calm discussion of this business would have prevented the committee from proceeding with any thing which they apprehended to be wrong and on the other hand would have ensured the hearty concurrence of the bishops in every thing where the rights of religion and conscience were left untouched what can be done in the present stage of the business i do not know but am very willing to discuss the matter with you provided that no harshness or asperity be admitted in our conversation   d agreed invectives embitter the heart but never enlighten the mind however i think it will be necessary to advert occasionally to the conduct of the bishops as you perhaps may do to that of the committee to point out the errors of either without acrimonious censures of their intentions will not injure their characters and may serve to discover truth i sincerely wish the bishops had not been so very intractable they have almost from the beginning refused to treat with the committee and this is the sole cause of our present critical situation   c perhaps that may be true but i believe the bishops did not know how to to proceed with safety they had after all some reasons to look on the proceedings of the committee with a jealous eye i fancy ecclesiastical history will not furnish a single example of a similar nature they are confessedly the guardians of religion according to the institution of christ and we are bound to hear and obey them in matters of religion the committee therefore were censurable first in attempting to impose an oath on the catholics without the previous approbation of the bishops  dly in attempting to support their proceedings against the positive censure the bishops had jointly published for although the two bishops from whatever motives did not publish the circular letter in their respective districts yet it is well known that the said letter was originally agreed to by all four assembled now i wish to know in what history we hear of any thing of the kind in past ages either as to the attempt originally or a fortiori where the attempt had been opposed by the positive censure of the bishops   d the committee had proceeded with calmness under a clear conviction of doing good and rendering essential service to the catholic body they had moreover two bishops and one of the most learned ecclesiastics in the kingdom at their head they had the protestation to guide them which was signed by the best heads and hearts in the nation hence they framed an oath strictly conformable to the tenor of the protest and never had a thought that it would be objected to the two bishops and the learned doctor their fellow members had approved of the oath and still approve of it at least the two surviving persons but the bishops met and censured the oath as inadmissible in general terms without assigning any reason what could the committee do but write an apology both to the bishops themselves and the catholics at large for although the bishops are the natural guardians of religion yet they are not the tyrants of their subjects the committee therefore had an undoubted right to explain themselves to the catholics of england and to request the bishops to reconsider the case and to insist on knowing their reasons for so rashly censuring an oath which was no more than a civil test of allegiance in which they had no right to interfere   c this brings us to a very serious debate and which can not be managed so well by a general answer if you please we will divide the subject and treat the different parts separately let us then consider first the article of the protestation   the right of the bishops to censure the oath without assigning their reasons for so doing the committees appeal to the nation will be hinted at under the second head you will see that we shall be obliged to examine whether the oath is a mere test of civil allegiance or a religiou oath i would not willingly enter upon a discussion of the merits or talents of the three ecclesiastics who were members of the committee we are to try the merits of the cause even against the persons who supported it and therefore their authority however great is out of the question i could wish however that we should previously discuss the propriety of the title protesting catholic dissenter this comes in order before the other heads and if you have no objection we will examine if even this title itself be admissible   d i willingly accept the challenge both as to the division of the matter and to the previous discussion of the title we shall then have another debate on the oath itself for i wish to clear up every difficulty concerning the whole affair i cannot however conceive what uneasiness the title should create we are under legal restrictions enacted from misapprehension or misrepresentation of our principles we seek for redress of our grievances government will not grant it to us as catholics what are we to do a nickname will do us no very great detriment and at all events one more humiliating can never be invented than that of papist by which we have alwas been distinguished in the penal statutes   c it was a remark worthy of the right rev dr challoner that it is no disgrace to the church of christ to be called by any opprobrious appellations by her rebellious children this ever has and will ever be the case but it is a sure mark of heresy or schism when any body of christians adopt a distinctive appellation different from their holy mother the word catholic according to the doctrine of the fathers has ever been a mark of the true church and has always discriminated her from every set of sectaries to abandon this or to adopt a new appellation is to allow that we do not belong to the true church but are really a new sect i will venture to say if these affairs go on that the word catholic will soon be left out of your title then you will only be protesting dissenters papist is a nickname imposed upon us this title is assumed by ourselves the committee have told us that on the propriety of its invention and its probable efficacy the merits of this plan chiefly rests it is then an appellation a nickname adopted by themselves not imposed upon them and would soon in fact as in name separate them from the great body of the catholic church this church will never admit as its members any persons who give up her ancient hereditary surname and adopt a new denomination if then our legislators are still so far worked up by their prejudices or so weak as to fear popular commotions that they will not grant us redress of our grievances on any other terms we ought to submit to providence and wait with patience for better times rather than shamefully disgrace ourselves by submitting to humiliating condescensions beneath the dignity of men of citizens of christians and catholics   d i can not see this title in that light we certainly are protesting against certain pernicious doctrines attributed to us we belong to the great body of the catholic church and we certainly dissent or differ from the established church we are then protesting catholic dissenters we can not expect that the legislature will grant us relief on our own terms if this name in our statute books should be substituted in the place of that odious appellation of papist where is the harm after all though the committee have agreed to the appellaion it is not their own act and deed they could not obtain relief on any other conditions   c please to recollect that the committee were not bound to seek relief and therefore if it were not to be obtained but on too hard conditions the matter should have rested there it is therefore strictly true that this title is their own and as i remarked before they glory in the invention but sir though i grant we are protesting yet i do not understand the addition of dissenters there is a great disparity between differ and dissent in matters of religion you may differ in opinion from one man or from all the world the word imports neither priority nor majority but the word dissent implies both you cannot then dissent from the established church as a catholic every sect is a dissent from the catholic church she dissents from no other church she cannot therefore adopt this title how then can you if you remain a catholic you have moreover a proof from the committees letter to the catholics that they are leaning toward a separation from the church by dividing themselves from its members you recollect that the probable efficacy of this title depends entirely on the supposition that protesting catholic dissenters are not of the same belief with those persons who are always distinguished by the style and title of papists in our penal statutes   d true sir papists are those who hold doctrines against which we protest doctrines inimical to civil government and who of course are not worthy of protection the penal laws are enacted against such persons and in my opinion very justly i am quite of the opinion of our committee that the present oath will show who are papists and who are not and those who are and dare avow themselves let them meet their deserts in the execution of the laws i can see no harm in separating from such persons whom i consider as monsters in society   c this is harsh indeed you consented to my proposal that no asperity should be admitted in our conversation i have often heard that language but never without horror i allow that the penal laws are enacted against persons called papists i allow also that protestants in general misrepresent them as holding doctrines inconsistent with the safety of the state but i positively deny that the penal statutes were either enacted against such only who avowed those doctrines or on account of holding them the statutes speak for themselves they are against the doctrines of transubstantiation invocation of saints and other articles of our creed they are against priests and jesuits against being reconciled to the church of rome etc etc not a word that i remember of those supposed doctrines of reputed papists and although protestants have generally supposed all papists to be dangerous subjects this idle supposition should be traced to its proper source the venom and hatred which the enemies of the church have ever entertained against its members and should be treated with the same contempt as the slanders of the pagans during the ten persecutions indeed sir you must know well that most of the doctrines against which we protest never were the opinions of any number of catholics in the world moreover the infallibility of the pope and his indirect power in some extraordinary cases over their temporal authority which i think are the only doctrines that have been maintained by those whom you style papists are no part of their religion no more than the denial of these doctrines is a part of your own why then would you wish to separate from them did any one of them hold the rest of the doctrines abjured by the oath he would neither be catholic nor papist even according to the new fashioned interpretation of the word in fine sir the penal statutes are enacted against those who profess the catholic religion whether they do or do not hold any of the doctrines which you protest against the present oath is a bad criterion to discover those whom you style papists as should it pass into a law every one who refuses to take it must of course be stigmatized as a papist though he should abjure every one of those doctrines as sincerely and heartily as yourself now sir i will venture to assert that a great majority of the catholics in england will refuse to take this captious equivocal oath though perhaps not one in a thousand maintains any of the doctrines abjured by it and although no one catholic should maintain any of the doctrines which are even constructively contrary to the safety of the state thus sir you wish to separate not only from real papists as you call them which i firmly believe do not exist only in the brain of the committee but even from persons who are as good subjects and better catholics than yourself you moreover wish to see the sword of persecution once more unsheathed against them and by supporting the present measures as much as depends on you you imbrue your hands in all the innocent blood that may be shed on that account i think sir it would redound more to the credit of the committee to abandon the cause which must produce a division fatal to religion if no worse comes of it than obstinately to persevere in the measure against the positive commands of the bishops and against the inclinations and wishes of so considerable a part of the body  to sum up all this we were happy and content but if the committee on honorable terms could have procured a relaxation or repeal of the laws which as yet are in force against catholics we should have acknowledged our obligation but i fear this new appellation is neither honorable nor safe it should not then have been adopted or submitted to it can never serve as a criterion to discover real papists it is both a false title and an useless nay a pernicious expedient   d it is indeed hard for any conscientious persons to be involved in the disagreeable dilemma of taking the oath against their consciences or being reputed papists for refusing it but after all it is their own faults they signed the protestation the committee had every right to suppose that they would swear to what they had signed the committee had drawn up an oath according to the tenor of the protest with very few additions or alterations these trivial in themselves and required by the heads of administration thus they were compelled to abide by the oath or forfeit their credit as men of honor by revoking their signatures to the protestation   c it is harder still that this dilemma should be the consequence of measures adopted and pursued by the committee their own rules prescribed that nothing of any consequence regarding the generality of catholics should be done without the approbation of a previous general meeting a petition from the north was presented to them requesting that nothing which concerned religion should even be treated of without the concurrence of the vicars apostolic this drew a declaration from the noble chairman at a subsequent meeting that nothing of the kind had been or would in future be done without their consent and approbation they have therefore infringed their own rules have exceeded the limits of their delegated power and broken their own promises and thus have involved themselves and us in a very disagreeable situation either they must commit themselves to the ministry by abandoning the project to satisfy those who refuse to take the oath or they must throw a great number of conscientious catholics into the far worse dilemma just mentioned i do not hesitate to say that the former is the more generous and what i think they are strictly bound to the protestation is no plea in their favor from its internal evidence and from the means made use of to bring it about it is an instrument which can never authorize the present proceedings nor give sanction to the oath   d why not sir but this brings us to the second part according to the division we agreed upon or rather the first part as thus far we have only been discussing preliminaries if the oath does not differ from the protestation how can we refuse it as to the means you mention i am not acquainted with any improper ones the protest was framed by protestants they had offered their objections against our principles in as much as they were supposed to be inimical to civil government they had also answered these objections in terms which they deemed satisfactory to government and to the nation this composition entirely their own was presented to the committee these gentlemen after some alterations approved of it presented it to the clergy in a numerous meeting who all signed it and it was afterward signed by all the clergy and gentry in the nation with very few exceptions if we recede from this we shall really prove what protestants object against us that nothing will bind us that we will not abide by any protestations or oaths whatsoever for i see no difference between one and the other i should make no scruple of swearing to any deed or instrument to which i had signed my name   c under favor sir there was another tribunal to which this matter should have been referred previous to the approbation of the committee the bishops should have taken the lead it belongs to their province to approve religious doctrines or to abjure and renounce false ones then indeed the committee would have had some plea for their subsequent proceedings but they first gave their fiat and then endeavored to bar out alterations however there is a great difference between an oath and a protestation    d under favor sir you in your turn do not observe the bounds of moderation agreed on between us what insinuations you throw out what were those means and endeavors you speak of   c i suppose the committee were convinced that the protest could and ought to be signed but apprehending that some persons from scruples others from too much zeal for scholastic accuracy would object against it hence they made use of means which they thought effectual and which proved such to elude every argument and obtain the signatures of the meeting without any alterations these were as follows letters were sent to correspondents in the country to dispose the minds of the clergy and gentry they were informed that the protest had been agreed to by every one objected to by no one and this when no one knew that such a thing existed except themselves and a very few of their confidents then a meeting was called of a chosen few of the clergy about twelve in number at which the secretary to the committee presided the best part of these gentlemen already in the secret being gained over were to engage the rest to espouse the good cause objections were started against the wording of it the answers were that the protest was a bare abjuration of the pernicious doctrines which protestants falsely imputed to us that it was only a declaration of our civil allegiance which had no connection with religious tenets stated in the objections and finally that no alteration would be admitted nothing of all this however could satisfy one of the characters present till they agreed to sign an explanatory protest in which they declared the sense in which it was presented in which themselves understood and signed it as this explanation had done away the difficulties of those who opposed the protestation they all signed it and by this were bound to support it in the general meeting of the clergy held soon after in this meeting the same means were made use of persons were employed to sound and persuade the leading characters who invariably asserted that no oath would be exacted that no alteration would be suffered  the meeting was then opened by the right reverend president the secretary of the committee read the consultations of the universities which were foreign to the purpose not one of their answers having any reference to what was objected against the protest then a sort of explication was read which was considered by many as introduced to intimidate and enforce the gentlemen to subscribe  several however did object not against the geneneral tenor of the protest but against the wording of it not against renouncing any doctrine consisidered as pernicious or inimical to civil government but against the terms in which they were abjured they thought that the abjuration of those doctrines was done in such loose inaccurate ambiguous and equivocal terms that sound doctrines as well as pernicious were equally rejected that truth as well as falsehood were equally renounced or might constructively be abjured and rejected according to the plain common and natural sense of the words of the protestation then again the usual answers none of the abettors of the protest pretended to call in question the principles of religion which the opposers of it held forth as injured by it but they contended that the protest went no farther than to secure our civil allegiance by renouncing the doctrines which were considered as inconsistent with the rights of government that the preamble declared it such that the meaning of the framers of it was such and finally that no alteration would be admitted a third declaration from the chair that we were not called together to examine and discuss but to sign put an end to the debate and all present signed it on that day or the next and soon after great part of the clergy and laity in the nation followed the example by signing themselves or some one signing for them i have heard and read of such proceedings among arians iconoclasts jansenists etc but never among catholics   d i do not see how you can complain of the committee they are not answerable for what others may do they intended an open meeting a free and candid discussion of the matter if this was hindered by the president he is to blame but after all how came you to let yourselves be drawn in if you disapproved of the measure you should have stood out like men you signed however and are bound by your signatures if you retract you fall under the just censure of protestants cast an odium on the tenets of your religion and hinder the catholics from emancipating themselves from the pressure of the penal laws   c i do not indeed think that all the members of the committee were engaged in these measures i think that several knew nothing of them but surely some of them suggested these measures to persons whom they thought proper to conduct them the fact is they were practiced the character of the president renders this beyond a doubt that he never would have proceeded in the manner he did if he had not been tampered with in this case the person who drew him into the snare is more to blame than himself  as to the rest standing out i own they were to blame in giving a sanction to what might be made an ill use of but swayed as they were by such an appearance of eandour on the one hand such plausible explications and positive asseverations of the meaning of the protest on the other then again the great authority which awed them it is no wonder that they fell into the snare they had no suspicions of intrigue or deceit and honestly thought themselves authorized to sign a declaration of their principles in a modified sense as they thought but which was the real sense of the protest according to the abettors of it notwithstanding they allowed that it was loosely and inaccurately worded it was on all hands agreed that the principles of religion should remain untouched and that the doctrines abjured in the protest were pernicious except the infallibility of the pope which we shall examine hereafter it was also agreed by the abettors of the protest that the sense in which the opposers signed was the only sense in which they themselves could conscientiously set their names to it these methods have often succeeded in other occasions and once were employed with success against a council of about  00 bishops i dare not even think that the same malevolent intention guided the promoters of the protest but it seems to have had the same effect thus far and shows how we ought to guard against every species of novelty even in using new words to express our ideas in matters of religious import this i will venture to assert that if the matter had been fairly and heartily discussed the protest would never have passed without several alterations to render it both clear and accurate for as it stands it is neither one nor the other in the present stage of the business it seems that we are pledged to take the oath by having signed the protest this is certainly a mistake for it is well known that several have retracted their signatures on account of the ill use that has been made of them and because they are apprehensive that the sense in which they signed is not the plain and obvious sense of the words as they were told it was these cannot take the oath but even those who have not retracted their signatures can not be bound to take the oath for as i said there is a great difference    d previous to that discussion pray reflect on the difficulties and danger of supporting that doctrine how will protestants ever give credit even to our oaths if we retract our signatures so solemnly pledged what can they think of our principles and our practice how can we hope for redress of our grievances if we confirm them in one of the worst of their prejudices against us that no oaths can bind us first answer this and then i will attend to your proceeding with what you have twice attempted excuse the interruption   c if protestants are candid they will applaud us and condemn you they will see that we retract not because we think our oaths or promises do not bind us but because we fear that we have rashly though honestly signed an instrument which we ought not to have signed not that we approve of any of the pernicious doctrines abjured in the protest but because we fear lest the loose and captious terms in which they are abjured should either by implication or directly involve the principles of religion they must then approve of our conduct but they will see that undue influence has been used to procure subscriptions and the suspicion will fall heavy on the committee and their abettors they will naturally infer that such persons are ready to swallow any oaths to get indulgences acquire the rights of citizens etc at all events they must condemn you for supporting and pursuing measures which are so seriously condemned as hostile to religion by so considerable a part of the catholic body was st austin wrong for writing his retractations were the fathers of ariminum in the wrong when they retracted their signatures by which they had been tricked into arianism contrary to their intention was the great fenelon a prevaricator because he retracted his writings when he found they had been condemned by the apostolic see the old latin proverb should be remembered humanum est errare sed diabolicum est perseverare    d it can not be supposed that protestants will condemn us for standing to our signatures but let me hear what difference you find between an oath and a protestation   c they differ widely i may sign my name to a protestation as an opinion but i can not swear to an opinion in a protestation i may pass over trivial inaccuracies of the framer in an oath i must have the nicest accuracy in the wording of it in a protestation i may admit an accommodated mode of expression especially if it is the declared sense of the author in an oath this would be perjury if we swear to the plain natural and obvious sense of the words for an accommodated sense is certainly an exposition foreign to the natural import of the terms the preamble may six the sense of a protest but can not fix that of an oath   d if this is true how many are perjured   c it would go beyond the limits of our plan to treat this subject at large please to refresh your memory with your former ideas on the constant doctrine of the church in her approved divines and i believe you will find that justice judgment and truth which have ever been thought necessary conditions of a lawful oath will go to prove the conditions i require moreover an oath stands upon its own ground without any reference to a preamble or to any accommodated sense of the proposer and therefore no preamble can affect the intrinsic merits of it and where the strict and natural sense of the words is sworn to any accommodated sense unless it were known and agreed to would be a mental restriction which is not justisiable in any oath whatsoever   d as this is only a conversation on amicable terms between us i wish not to push this matter any further at present we may both find it worth our while to look over the treatise de juramento in some approved divine and have another discourse on the subject on some future occasion i think we may here leave the subject of the protestation as to its intrinsic merits we shall occasionally advert to them when we come to discuss the oath let us therefore pass to the second article of our proposed plan the right of the bishops to censure the oath in globo without assigning any reason for so doing we have a right to know their reasons and they are bound to give them in a tone of sobriety i say rather they had no righr at all to interfere as the oath is a mere civil test of allegiance no ways connected with religion and therefore by no means subjected to the jurisdiction of the bishops   c indeed sir this is strange language and which i never expected to have heard from any one who pretends to be a catholic i always understood by the article of my creed the holy catholic church that the bishops are constituted and appointed as our fathers in religion to instruct govern and direct us in the paths of faith and virtue and that we are bound to hear and obey them in matters appertaining to their charge it was therefore the duty of the bishops to consider whether the oath left the rights of religion untouched on this they met and decided in the negative it was then the duty of their flock to submit at least till their sentence should be reversed by a superior tribunal but it appears that you gentlemen dissenters do not wish to appeal to rome but to the catholics of england   d supposing that right in the bishops they are bound to give their reasons they are our fathers but not our masters they are appointed to feed us as the greek text has it but they are not authorized to domineer over us much less to fleece or butcher us we are not bound to blind obedience and therefore we insist on knowing what harm the oath will do to religion this they will not dare not or can not tell us we complain of this and appeal to our fellow catholics by explaining our conduct and our motives that they may all see how injuriously we are treated i say we for i most heartily approve of the committees letter we shall not appeal to ultramontane principles for the decision of a cause to which we think ourselves perfectly competent   c i grant that bishops are fathers not tyrants that they are appointed to feed us if you will for i can see no difference how can they seed us unless we are bound to boey you seem to allow a sort of obedience but will not submit blindly so far i agree but pray who is to decide between a bishop and his flock according to the original appointment of bishops they are the guardians of religion they are to guide their flocks into salutary pastures and point out the poisonous weeds which they occasionally meet with thus far is their duty the manner how they are to perform it is left to their discretion they are not to exercise a haughty and imperious command over their subjects but this ought never to be supposed much less urged against them without manifest reasons which admit of no doubt they are answerable to god for their conduct but not to their flocks it is true we are not bound to blind obedience i e to submit against the dictates of reason but where shall we six the limits if we are always to insist upon their giving reasons for their conduct we shall soon do away their authority if we are to be the judges of their proceedings then we are their superiors an appeal from them to the public at large in that case would be legal and proper but i dare assert that there never has been a schism in the church no resistance ever happened to episcopal authority which would not be justifiable on the same grounds let the abettors of any schismatical division only appeal from the authority of bishops to the public or rather to their own judgment and then the episcopal authority will be subjected to the private judgment of every capricious innovator pray sir what has the reformation done more  in one word the bishops though superiors have no right to exact unlimitted and blind obedience but neither have their flocks an unlimited right to examine and decide on the exercise of their authority now by your leave sir i will point out the land mark which was originally fixed and firmly established by the great founder of our religion and which has ever been acknowledged by all true catholics from the first foundation of christianity every bishop is a competent judge of controversy to his flock and they are bound to submit to his decision in every case whatsoever unless  st his decision is evidently wrong or  d unless his sentence should be reversed by a superior court and to this court you frankly own you dare not appeal   d were i to close with you on your own terms i should still have good grounds to assert that the bishops are in the wrong and therefore we are not obliged to submit to their decision i apprehend that even yourself sir will require two conditions in the sentence emanent from episcopal authority without which it will never have the force of law the  st that the bishops shall proceed with calmness and deliberation and not pronounce finally till they have duly weighed and properly discussed the subject in debate the  d that the matter itself shall be subjected to their authority and not purely of a temporal nature for otherwise any sentence of bishops would be out of the province of their jurisdiction and of no force whatever now sir as to the first condition it is very well known that the bishops on their arrival in london were visibly prepossessed they did not consult any individual in london and proceeded without the least deliberation or discussion to censure indiscriminately the bill the protestation and the oath whereas in strict justice nothing ought to have been the subject of their deliberations but that part of the oath which differs from the protestation as to the second condition i shall beg leave to observe that as the oath is barely a test of civil allegiance that religion is no ways concerned in it only in as much as we are called upon to abjure those pernicious tenets which our adversaries have falsely attributed to our religion it does not appertain to the jurisdiction of the bishops and therefore their censure is null and void for want of competency in the judges even if they had proceeded with that calmness and deliberation which becomes their dignity and which i observed they did not   c i admit your two conditions but you will please to observe that there are certain degrees of deliberation and discussion not all equally necessary in every controversy sometimes the question is obscure and perplexed on other occasions it is clear and obvious the bishops therefore are to proceed with calmness and that necessary discussion which the matter requires and here again they only are competent to judge when they have taken the necessary steps for information every innovator the most daring heretic from the same principle might call in question the decisions of every bishop and every general council from the origin of christianity till this day he has only to say that they did not proceed with all the caution necessary on the occasion and therefore the decision is informal whether given by four vicars apostolic or by five hundred bishops in a general council this you see is a method of setting aside their authority as effectual as any that has ever been attempted by any heretic that ever existed  you say the bishops were visibly prepossessed i believe they were this again is an objection which luther might equally have urged against the council of trent the iconoclasts against the second of nice and arius against the first etc the bishops are jealous of the rights of religion are ever watchful over the sacred depositum committed to their care and as they are commanded to deliver it to after generations without spot or blemish as they had received it from their fathers they start at the least innovation should they afterward proceed to censure they must be prepossessed with the impressions of truth against error and novelty but they consulted no one in london really sir this is not quite the truth but i suppose you mean that they consulted none of the committee or of their friends indeed i see no necessity they had to consult any one on this side of the question they had already received all the information they had any right to expect from that quarter they had a book in folio to instruct them and a positive assurance that not one tittle of the oath would be suffered to be altered as if the same measures were again to succeed as had been practiced with regard to the protestation the bishops however by this time found they had been drawn into a snare and therefore were resolved that their signature of the protest should be no hindrance to the sentence they determined to pass upon the oath they had previously had the opinions of some of the best divines of their respective districts and moreover took the advice of those even in london whom they thought they could trust and then proceeded to condemn not as you say the bill the protestation and the oath but the oath only and some restrictive causes of the bill by which we were placed in a worse condition than before and to which they thought we ought not to submit  the case therefore appearing clear they had every degree of information necessary and therefore their decision was regular and legal our submission must follow of course unless this sentence is reversed by a higher court which i fancy you will never solicit and should you it would not be granted i shall now proceed to examine the right of interference in the bishops  i own i am perfectly astonished that such a plea should ever be made i once more return to my retortion this plea would equally serve to support every error that ever existed  the author and promoter of every heresy might say and has always said that the interference of bishops is illegal that they mean not to infringe on the rights of religion that they support no doctrines contrary to faith etc let the oath of supremacy itself be proposed as a test of civil allegiance why could not this be equally taken on the same grounds at all events that oath might go down by means of an explication we need only be told that the committee have consulted persons of the first rate abilities who have long been exercised in constitutional disquisitions from whom the people of england receive their notions both of names and things that these great men do not understand the oath of supremacy as subversive of the popes jurisdiction in as much as it is purely spiritual but only so far as it is coercive and to be enforced by means of a temporal nature if then is added that government and the public are those who are to be satisfied that they insist on this oath and will accept of no other then i say we have summed up the best reasons for the present oath and which are equally strong in favor of that of supremacy in similar circumstances  may not government require as a test of our civil allegiance that we renounce transubstantiation or any other article of our creed you might equally swallow that and pretend that you only reject it so far as it is inimical to civil government viz none at all to what absurdities would these principles lead us a test of civil allegiance why then are religious topics introduced a mere test of allegiance has nothing to do with religion we are ready to swear allegiance to his majesty in as full and ample a manner as any government in the world has a right to exact it from a subject of any denomination but we must renounce certain opinions inimical to civil government or they cannot trust even to our oaths what absurdity if they will not believe our actions they would not believe though even one was to rise from the dead to assure them of our sidelity if they suppose that no oaths can bind us how can this one if we can get dispensations for oaths or evade their force by mental restrictions why have we not done so with those oaths which have all along been exacted by government why have we for two hundred years suffered disabilities sines imprisonment and death itself when a dispensation or mental restriction would have set us on a level with our fellow subjects or were those our real principles could we not equally follow them in the present question we certainly should follow them and take the oath without further examination and then get over it either by a mental restriction or dispensation but after all we are ready to satisfy them and renounce those principles which are any ways repugnant to the duties of civil and social life yet we are told that this is to be done in terms prescribed by men in power and that they must be satisfied an oath is therefore framed for the purpose which equally rejects truth with salsehood sound doctrines with error   d hold sir this is too much were that the case i should not attempt to defend it the oath of supremacy and others you have hinted at cannot be taken by a catholic as they reject the principles of our faith but the present oath is a mere test of civil allegiance and no ways affects the rights of religion although this oath has been before government and the nation for above a year yet no one has ever been able to point out a single deviation from the rules of faith or morality it is therefore only a test of civil allegiance and the bishops had no right to interfere   c sir a bare assertion is no proof however you must grant that if this oath does contain any thing contrary to sound doctrine then it cannot be taken therefore the question finally rests on the intrinsic merits of the oath the oath then must be examined by whom once more i assert it belongs to the bishops to examine whether an oath contains any thing contrary to religion they have done this and condemned it shall we adhere to our pastors or to the committee the bishops say children take not that oath it contains a poison which will contaminate your souls the committee says gentlemen do not mind your bishops the oath is only a test of allegiance their proof of this is the c  the m  etc understand it only in that sense is this the way that christians used formerly to reason on the tenets of their religion did they go to the emperors or their ministers to be informed what was sound doctrine and what was not  but no one has ever been able to point out wherein it deviates from faith or morality indeed sir several propositions have been pointed out which without doubt express doctrines contrary to the principles of our religion either directly or by just and necessary inference the only answer that has ever been given is in effect that the oath does not mean what it says but if you please we will now examine the oath itself for after all your preliminaries and assertions your cause must be decided by the intrinsic merits of the oath   d i own that the question must be sinally determined by the oath itself i have heard some difficulties but none of any consequence they were all grounded either in an apprehension of being trappaned into error or too strong an adhesion to scholastic nicety however i am willing to discuss the oath itself and wish you to state your difficulties against it from beginning to end that we may leave nothing unexamined which can be objected against it   c i shall then begin with the clause in the oath by which we swear to maintain support and defend the succession in the protestant line exclusively what right has any government on earth to exact such a clause in an oath of allegiance so completely foreign to the purpose of such an oath i could write a treatise against it but shall only remark for the present that if government required it we might as well swear to maintain support and defend all the penal laws which stand in our statute books to the scandal of an enlightened age and the disgrace of a nation which boasts of its freedom in this supposition should the nation at large with its king at their head be reconciled to the catholic church by virtue of this curious oath i am bound to fight till death against the king and the nation because they have jointly come over to my religion nay even though on one in the nation should turn to the catholic religion should the decendants of sophia duchess of hanover at any future period forfeit their right to the crown and another family be placed on the throne i should equally be bound by this oath to enlist under the banners of don quixote and encounter every windmill or slock of sheep which should declare in favor of the new king against the family of brunswick   d indeed sir these suppositions are too ludicrous to deserve a serious answer however suppose the cases proposed this law would be reversed by the nation and therefore this oath would no longer be binding but sir this is the oath of abjuration taken by all the kings subjects and which for the sake of unformity the present government insists on being tendered equally to catholics as to every other description of men the catholics have in fact already taken it and the crown lawyers have determined that the oath of      involves every consequence of the common oath of allegiance and abjuration whoever opposes the act of settlement incurs a praemunire if in discourse high treason if in writing or action by recognizing his present majesty and his successors to be lawful kings of this realm their title to the throne is equally recognized and that title is grounded solely on the act of settlement   c these are knock down arguments with a witness it is high treason to oppose the act of settlement therefore i am obliged in conscience to swear to maintain support and defend it i have sworn to support the succession in his majestys family therefore i have sworn to oppose any of his majestys successors should they come over to my faith i have sworn to depose even his majesty now on the throne should he become a catholic this is a deposing power which i swear to support and defend and this power is to be exercised for no other reason than a conscientious practice of that religion which i believe to be the only true one in one part i swear against the deposing power here i swear to maintain support and defend it but the crown lawyers have defined and decided the question so i am bound by oath to every consequence which their learned heads can draw from an oath by wresting it from its plain and obvious sense i shall endeavor to prove that this oath destroys the boasted omnipotence of parliament this is a consequence which the crown lawyers probably have not attended to but to which i equally swear as to the other for sir by virtue of this oath the reigning family is as firmly established on the throne as if it were appointed by god himself or had an hereditary right altogether indefeasible and therefore the parliament even with the consent of the nation at large can never alter the succession in any given case whatsoever you say indeed in the cases referred to before that this law would be reversed but sir the person who should propose the repeal of the act of settlement would be perjured he who seconds it would be perjured every man in the nation that assents to it would equally be perjured and even every one who does not use his utmost endeavors to prevent the repeal would incur the guilt of perjury i may then truly say that this act can never be repealed while this oath stands as it cannot be repealed without stigmatizing a whole nation with the guilt of perjury i think this oath is a flat contradiction to the very fundamental principles of our happy constitution let the act of settlement remain till parliament and the nation think proper to repeal it but let no man be bound to swear to maintain support and defend it to the utmost of his power for this is evidently overturning the constitution as settled by that very act  i beg leave to observe that the omnipotence of parliament has its bounds there is another court before which the members of the british senate must one day appear they will then know whether they had a right to deprive a man of his crown his estate or his life on account of his religion till then i shall neither oppose nor write against the act of settlement but i can not in honor and conscience as an englishman who admires the constitution of his country i can not swear to maintain support and defend it to the utmost of my power for at some future period the wisdom of the nation may think proper to alter it it may for any thing we know be necessary to alter it and this can never be effected while this oath stands i hope sir you will not say that parliament can dispense with the obligation of this oath will you please to drop this subject as it is of too delicate a nature to be treated with freedom   d with all my heart what then is the next clause you object to i hope you are not so narrowminded as to cavil at the word heretical no catholic hesitates to call the deposing and kingkilling doctrines antichristian contrary to the word of god and the tradition of the fathers materially heretical in one part and both materially and formally heretical in the other besides this is the oath of the kingdom and if catholics wish to share in the privileges of citizens they must bind themselves by the same ties with their fellow subjects   c indeed sir i do make so very serious an objection against that word that although every other difficulty should be removed i would not take the oath for that doctrine however false erroneous or whatever else it be called is not heretical heresy has always been defined an error in articles of faith you know well that nothing can be an article of faith unless   it be a revealed doctrine and   unless it be proposed by the church to be believed as such i hope you will not pretend that the opposite doctrine to the deposing tenet is proposed by the church to be believed as revealed then the contrary doctrine is not heretical  your observation of material heresy is not just for what is only materially heretical is not properly heretical in the plain and obvious sense of the word to which we swear hence swearing that you believe that doctrine to be heretical is perjury unless you restrain the term from its plain and obvious meaning to an improper sense and this is a mental restriction contrary to the sense of the oath which the illiterate multitude do not understand and which those who framed or those who tender the oath have never thought of   d but sir although it is not strictly heretical in a catholic sense it is heretical as protestants understand it and this is quite sufficient for me to swear it as i must take the oath in that sense in which it is proposed now sir that doctrine is heretical in their sense of the term which is contrary to the word of god i hope you will allow this doctrine to be contrary to the word of god it is then heretical   c so then for the same reason i might equally swear that the contrary doctrine is an article of faith what because protestants have given a wrong explication of the term i may swear to it without explication or qualification indeed sir if protestants ever are informed of these principles i fear they will think that you make very light of oaths you will however please to remember the argument of john almond alias lathome urged against dr king bishop of london recorded in the memoirs of missionary priests by which he silenced the bishop and proved beyond a reply that the deposing doctrine is not heretical even in the protestant sense of the word his argument was this no position on your grounds can be heretical unless it be expressly censured for heretical by the word of god or the contradictory expressly contained in the word of god but this position the deposing doctrine is not expressly censured for heretical by the word of god nor is the contradictory expressly contained in the word of god ergo it is not heretical this was his argument it is now mine should you ask with the bishop you would have it censured in express words i answer with the martyr you are bound to bring a censure in express words which because i see you can not answer this consequence this position is not set down at all in the bible ergo it can not be censured by the bible the only answer the bishop made was that almond was a proud arrogant jack this sir you must know is an unanswerable argument in protestant principles which cannot admit of an article of faith without express warrant from scripture in a word the deposing doctrine is not properly heretical either in the catholic or the protestant acceptance of the term therefore this oath can not lawfully be taken either by catholics or protestants  to what you add that this is the oath of the kingdom etc i shall only say that the same political motives would equally prove the lawfulness of the oath of supremacy or any other which disgrace our statute books to the eternal shame of an enlightened age   d i do not see any sense in this logical acuteness too close an adhesion to scholastic accuracy is very ill timed we may sometimes overshoot the mark by too great nicety i think it is a pity that such cavils should hinder our emancipation from the pressure of the penal laws suppose the word heretical were not exactly accurate as it is only inserted for a strong mark of aversion to such doctrines i do not see why we may not be authorized to admit of it   c indeed sir this doctrine will not do when we swear to the plain and ordinary sense of the words i suppose you remember that the task of qualifying bad doctrines by proper epithets is perhaps one of the hardest in dogmatical theology there are doctrines which though not heretical are nevertheless nearly heretical suspected of heresy others though not schismatical are leading to schism others again erroneous suspicious scandalous rash offensive of pious ears etc etc it is i say a very difficult matter to fix the precise qualification to every proposition but where the qualification is evidently wrong which is really the case in our present debate no catholic can in conscience subscribe to it for that defect falsifies the whole proposition for although it be true that the deposing doctrine is false erroneous seditious and perhaps impious in as much as it is a violation of our duty to kings commanded by the fourth precept of the law yet it is most certainly not heretical as for the word damnable i do not see what precise sense it bears and therefore would have it expunged as useless  i shall finish my observations on this head with a remark on the ungenerous treatment we are forced to submit to from our protestant brethren in this particular   it is a known fact that the popes have never yet attempted to dethrone princes who were born and bred up protestants but such only as were catholics and excommunicated for their crimes real or supposed or invasion of the rights of the church it is also a notorious lamentable fact that most of the principal reformers preached and practiced when in their power the deposing doctrine of catholic princes whenever they opposed the preaching of the word of god as they termed it the expulsion of the queen of scots by her rebellious subjects and the subsequent murder of that independent sovereign princess by queen elizabeth are an indelible disgrace to great britain however we are still to be abused and reviled for teaching the kingkilling doctrine which we have ever abhorred and the deposing doctrine which never was a principle of our religion and which we are all ready to abjure in any terms which do not imply a falsehood  you will please to reflect sir that this very act by which catholics are permitted to enjoy some few only of the inalienable rights of man enforces this very doctrine of deposing kings by declaring a catholic to be deprived of the right to the crown protestants who have preached and practiced these doctrines are willing to grant a legal exercise of our religion which they are ashamed to refuse yet still confined under such legal restrictions as are never elsewhere established and all this on condition that we shall be compelled to abjure and renounce as heretical a doctrine which was the universal doctrine of the first reformers without which the reformation had never been propagated and which is supported and confirmed by this very act sure sir this is an indignity to which i hope you will not submit it is most certainly a disgrace to protestants to propose it if you please we will pass to the next clause in the oath   d agreed i suppose it is that about the popes authority but catholics are not called upon to explain how far the authority of the pope really extends they are only required to say that it does not affect the constitution nor the legal establishment of the church nor the rights of the subject all temporal concerns undoubtedly and when by a negative oath catholics have disclaimed any temporal interference they are left at full liberty to believe and practice whatever their consciences may tell them to be conformable to the revelation of christ or the decrees of the church i hope you do not allow of any power or right in the pope to interfere in temporals    c indeed sir i am as willing as yourself to abjure the popes right of interference in concerns of a temporal nature but the oath as it stands either directly or by just and necessary consequences abjures also his spiritual jurisdiction in some cases to which it has always been believed to extend i will point out the particular difficulty in this paragraph and then we will examine it calmly and heartily  i abjure with you all right of interference which can directly or indirectly affect the independence sovereignty or constitution of this kingdom or with the civil government thereof or with the temporal rights or civil liberty or property of the subject but as to the laws of the nation the ecclesiastical government as by law established and the persons of the subjects of these realms i think no catholic can swear away the right of the popes interference without abjuring the catholic doctrine of his primacy now sir if you please we will discuss these articles separately for the sake of perspicuity  first then as to the laws i was once of opinion that this might be admitted if the strict definition of law were attended to because a necessary condition of a law is that it shall be just and lawful i thought that the sanguinary penal laws as also every other statute in this kingdom if repugnant to the laws of god or the church would not be comprehended under that name and as i do not allow any right of interference with the just laws of any nation it appeared that the laws in england could not be subjected to any sort of control of the pope but the nation at large would certainly understand every act of parliament as comprehended under the name of law and therefore to abjure the right of interference in the pope in this unlimited manner would be abjuring his spiritual supremacy and jurisdiction which he holds from god alone for in virtue of his primacy he is bound to watch over the laws of god and the church and to enforce the observance of both by commands censures and other spiritual means and of course to command the nonobservance of the laws of any kingdom when such laws are contrary to those of god and the church in england not to mention other matters several impediments of matrimony are done away by the laws of the realm should then catholics marry under any of these disabilities which have not the same effect by the laws of the land the pope in virtue of his primacy has an undoubted right to command a separation to enforce his commands by ecclesiastical censures  now sir i apprehend this is to interfere in the laws of the land at least in an indirect manner to recall or abrogate the laws would be a direct interference to command or bind the conscience to the nonobservance of the laws would be interfering indirectly   d i agree to your division of the subject now to what you have advanced on the right of interference in the laws of the land i have only to remark that the difficulty evidently originates in misconception the legal meaning and force of the terms are chiefly to be considered words in every language may alter their prior signification and carry a different import the lawyers and those whose lives are spent in attending to great legislative questions from whom the people of england are in the habit of deriving their notions both of words and things such men i say are the best qualified to ascertain the precise meaning and import of the oath now our committee assures us that they have not met a single person of this description who does not understand and reason on the expression in question in the same manner as they do that is that the oath only abjures an interference of a coercive nature they say that they only intend to deny the right to legislate in temporal concerns or to enforce his the popes spiritual legislation by a coercion of a temporal nature surely you will not allow any such power in the pope   c i allow of no temporal power in the primacy whatever territorial jurisdiction he may have from grants of sovereign princes or otherwise in as much as such authority is given by men as to a prince not by jesus christ as to a bishop and primate of the church it must necessarily be confined to his own dominions out of which he has no temporal authority whatsoever but sir in virtue of his spiritual authority he is bound to watch over the laws of god and the church and to enforce the observance of them any temporal laws or constitutions to the contrary notwithstanding whenever then the laws of a kingdom are contrary to the laws of god or the church as was always and still is the case where the catholic is not the established religion the pope by virtue of his spiritual authority is bound to exert the power of the keys committed to him by commanding the nonobservance of such temporal laws and should the pastors be remiss in watching over the execution of such his commands he has an undoubted right to compel them to obedience by censures of excommunication suspension or interdict as he judges necessary it were trisling with the plain and ordinary sense of words to say that this is not the interference meant by the oath this oath expressly abjures every right of interference direct or indirect in the laws of the land i cannot conceive how a command to violate the laws or censure against any one for not violating them can be said not to interfere at least indirectly there is not a dictionary extant that will authorize the supposition the committees appeal to the lawyers etc is foreign to the purpose it is not to any new exposition or import of the words nor to any learned interpretation of them that we are called to swear but to the plain obvious and ordinary sense which of course ought to be as well understood by every man of sound judgment in the nation as by the lord chancellor himself i beg leave sir to assert from the committees letter to the bishops that a command or censure is an interference my lords they say to this imprudent interference of paul the vth english catholics may ascribe in a great measure all the odium and all the oppression under which they have since groaned paul the vth then really did interfere the committee ibid will tell you how he sulminated a condemnation of this political oath meaning the oath of james i he declared it inconsistent with faith and hostile to salvation and enjoined the english catholics not to take it as they say in their appeal from the censure of the bishops to the catholics of england a command a prohibition a censure are therefore an interference even as the committee understand the term but they allow a right of commanding etc in the last mentioned letter page   if one province of a kingdom were without justice or reason to rebel against the state if one state were to exercise undue sovereignty over another  if the constitution of a state were essentially wicked  if the government of a state were to be tyranical and unjust etc are not these as much sins in the eye of god as they are crimes in the eye of man as such are they not subject to the spiritual power of the church to her teaching preaching and censuring in this passage they only mention the church but from their manner of reasoning in the fifth page they evidently suppose this same right in the pope he then has a right to issue his commands prohibitions and censures but as you have seen from the letter to the bishops commands or prohibitions and a fortiori censures are a real interference he has then an undoubted right to interfere in the laws when they are contrary to the laws of god or the church  i own i was rather surprised at reading the last quoted passage it gives a power to the church or the pope which supposes a right of inspection over the political constitution the right of sovereignty or resistance for without such a right how can he pronounce in any of the cases above mentioned i rather think this was an unguarded concession as a few lines below we find the following words that the church has no jurisdiction or authority that can directly or indirectly affect or interfere with the civil independence sovereignty constitution or government of a sovereign state is acknowledged by our best writers he has no right to interfere in the civil independence or sovereignty of a state yet he may pronounce against the independence of any part of an empire should it unjustly rebel he has no right to interfere in the constitution but he may pronounce it essentially wicked he has no right to interfere in the government of a state but he may declare it tyranical and unjust what can all this mean i fear we must go to the c  to understand it the committee here grants a power to the pope which very few pontiffs have ever assumed the pope did not attempt to decide whether great britain was tyranical or america unjust in rebelling the present pope indeed has written to the bishops in the netherlands to exhort them to use their influence in reestablishing order and submission to their new prince but the bishops thought proper to judge for themselves and answered his holiness accordingly though with due respect we have not heard of his interfering any further  as for the word coercion it is perhaps equally ambiguous as the term interference  should a man be forced by suspension or excommunication to restore the churchs patrimony unjustly seized or should a kingdom be laid under an interdict to enforce a compliance with the laws of god or the church would not these means be called coercive it were folly to swear that the pope has no right to send an army to enforce submission to his mandates   d indeed sir this too close adhesion to nicety will do us no good we have a fair and candid exposition of the oath given by the committee they declare positively that this exposition is the real sense of it and that it is understood in that sense by all the great men in the nation you know it is a maxim in law that you must take an oath in the sense of the framer and proposer of it why therefore should we refuse this oath on account of this clause which confessedly only abjures coercive interference which even yourself do not allow of the explication of the committee is orthodox and moreover gives the true sense of the oath   c i am very willing to submit to the judgment of a man in his own art of which i am ignorant granting then every degree of competency to the decisions of those great men you allude to in legal and constitutional disquisitions am i also to allow them to be competent judges in religious questions must i give them an infallibility in this dogmatical fact which they require of me to refuse to the pope even in doctrines must i appeal to the adversaries of my faith to know how far their tenets injure my creed these questions carry their answers with them would you sir take the oath of supremacy were the chancellor to tell you that no spiritual jurisdiction is meant to be abjured thereby except such as is enforced by coercive measures of a temporal nature i must then say i cannot admit of their exposition which if it be the right one they can have no rational objection to alter that the terms expressing their meaning shall otherwise be so couched as to calm the fears of catholics  the explication of the committee is not orthodox in the article of dispensing with the obligation of oaths nor in the abjuration of the popes infallibility as a pernicious doctrine it is captious and ensnaring in the abjuration of the spiritual power of the pope and the title of protesting catholic diffenter it does not touch upon several real difficulties it is not then admissible the true plain obvious and ordinary sense of an oath appears naturally on the first reading of it not from learned expositions what was the sense of the oath in the opinion of almost all catholics previous to the explication what is still the opinion of our divines abroad even the explication itself has not convinced one half of the nation it remains then not plainly and obviously orthodox but at best obscure and equivocal it should not then be admitted  what you say of the maxim of canon law is very just in this sense that you are not to wrest an oath from the sense of the proposers by private interpretation mental restriction etc but this will not authorize you to swear to an error in the plain and ordinary sense of the words although perhaps the error would be removed by a private interpretation of the framers of it  remember sir the private intrepretation given by ursarius and valens in the council of ariminum and of the english bishops when they granted the supremacy to king henry the viiith remember also the fatal consequences of acceding to measures which were not lawful without these private interpretations you know well that the bishops shamefully prevaricated in both cases in the former they sacrificed the word consubstantial consecrated by the council of nice in the latter they gave up an article of faith have we not every reason to fear the same dire effects in our times suppose we take the oath in the explained sense put the following case should any catholic take advantage of the laws of the land having divorced his wife for crim con marry again during her life time in this case i say should the pope interfere by commands or censures would not every person who accedes to or submits to this interference be considered as a prevaricator against his oath these reasons you see equally prove the other two exceptions of the ecclesiastical government and the persons of his majestys subjects to be inadmissible for if he has a right to command and if commanding is a real interference then this oath cannot be reconciled with the rights of his primacy   d i do not see what the pope has to do with the ecclesiastical government of the nation as by law established for as such it is a civil and temporal concern in which you do not allow of any interference as to the persons of englishmen he has no further to do with them than to teach them their duty as their primate when it becomes necessary to exert his authority so far   c so i suppose were this oath taken and the act past that you would deny the pope every right of jurisdiction over the catholic religion as in that case it would also be established by law and of course a temporal concern as you are pleased to term it but sir whether the religion established by law be catholic or protestant we catholics cannot deny but that the sovereign pontiff is the real pastor of every one who has entered the church by baptism and that he is by right of the primacy the proper superior of every lawful ecclesiastical government and moreover that he is invested with a right of control over ever unlawful ecclesiastical government you see sir from the quotation above that the committee allows a right of inspection even over the civil government when it is essentially wicked or tyranical is not every unlawful spiritual government such i must indeed observe that when an ecclesiastical government whether established by law or not has cast off the authority of the sea of rome especially when it has subsisted for a long series of years it would be idle and nugatory in the sovereign pontiff to issue his commands or censures where he must know they would be equally disregarded but the right of chief pastor is one thing the power of exercising this right is another it were folly to swear against the power of executing his decrees for plain fact declares that he has none but we are called upon to swear against the right which as catholics we cannot do for sir no violent division of unity or separation from the communion of the catholic church can ever deprive him of the right of ecclesiastical control which he has received from god himself  i say the same as to the persons for in quality of primate of the church all catholics owe him ecclesiastical obedience now his censures or commands although in matters purely spiritual might have at least an indirect interference with the liberty and persons of catholics i fancy a sentence of suspension deposition or excommunication fulminated against any clergyman on account of the oath would sit very uneasily on his shoulders and would no doubt be considered as interfering with his liberty and person too nay i dare say it would be called an interference in temporals by the abettors of the committee who are pleased to say that the oath is merely civil and political  i shall now proceed to the next clause in the oath which i shall only note because it is very ill worded and might induce some ignorant person to think that we abjured the power of forgiving sin by means of the sacrament of penance this we cannot do any more than protestants can abjure the power of forgiving sins by means of baptism it is indeed very true that no priest or prelate can forgive sins at his will and pleasure without the previous and necessary conditions of a sincere repentance and although i believe that the committee understand it in this sense yet as it stands worded by our adversaries it is very suspicious and as such not admissible   d there is no doubt but that the committee and the framers of it understand this clause in the sense in which you have explained it this scrupulous exactness which you require throughout as i have all along remarked greatly injures our cause pray what is your next nicety   c the history of the protestation compells us to be cautious in admitting any thing which might perhaps be misconstrued and wrested from our real meaning my next difficulty is that no breach of faith with any person can ever be justified under pretense that such person is an insidel i have no difficulty in the clause as far as it concerns heretics nor even as it touches insidels provided that the breach of faith be restrained to common dealings promises or engagements between men but as you have observed i am become so very nice that i will not admit of any expression which is not strictly accurate now sir you will please to recollect that a marriage with an insidel or one who has not been baptized is null and void by the laws of the church would not a separation from such person after a marriage contracted be deemed a breach of says pledged in the most solemn and awful manner it is however justifiable should that person refuse to be baptized and remarried barely because that person is an insidel  i will pass with your leave from nicety to a difficulty of a more serious nature contained in the next clause wherein i am called upon to swear that no ecclesiastical power whatever can dispense with the obligation of any oath whatsoever i have extracted thus much only of this clause because i allow of no power of dispensing in civil compacts or bargains nor yet in oaths of allegiance but this universal proposition which denies the power of dispensing in any oath whatever is erroneous and not to say more of it contrary to the universal practice of the church   d you mean i suppose promissory oaths made to god but sir the bill does not refer to vows or other solemn promises made to god but only such as affect the rights of third persons now sir in such promissory oaths between man and man no priest or prelate can dispense an oath may be taken under such circumstances as to be absolutely void and then no dispensation is necessary for example in case an oath were extorted by great personal violence or threats of immediate death in such cases there may be a question whether the obligations exist but if they do exist no power can dispense from them this is the doctrine of our committee page the  th of their letter to the catholics of england and which they learned from some of the ablest divines of the kingdom   c indeed sir this strange explication does not amend the clause but rather adds to its malignity although the bill does not mention vows yet it certainly comprehends every oath even those made to god alone and roundly asserts that no power can dispense with the obligation of any such oath this i once more assert is erroneous if you pretend as some have done that such oaths are to be considered as vows i have only to answer that your explication is equally erroneous with the assertion no orthodox divine ever yet pretended to confound the nature of an oath with that of a vow they differ widly as you will easily discover on the slightest inspection into any approved divine i must refer you to those who have treated the matter as it would go beyond our limits to enter into particulars  the doctrine of the committee is not accurate those able divines who taught them should be sent to school to restudy their lesson i grant that in some cases an oath may be null and void as when it is unlawful to be taken then indeed there is no need of a dispensation but in the cases alluded to of an oath extorted either by personal violence or some pressing necessity the oath is not void unless the thing promised be wicked or the oath be otherwise invalidated a simple promise given and accepted creates an obligation in justice to the performance should this promise be confirmed by oath then there arises an obligation from the tie of religion force violence or fraud would destroy the obligation of justice arising from the promise but not the tie of religion arising from the oath for although the man who has extorted the oath has no right to exact the performance yet the reverence due to the sacred name of god requires that i should perform what i have sworn to do when i can lawfully do it this obligation therefore still subsists until it is taken away by dispensation this is the doctrine of orthodox divines and would not have been called in question by the committee divines but for the crooked purposes of worldly policy when they like melancthon had advanced too far to retreat they were driven to these paltry shifts to defend a bad cause they may deceive the committee and perhaps themselves too but will never deceive an orthodox divine of any information   d under favor sir you are too hard upon those good men with whom the committee have discussed this matter by a dispensation i understand a declaration that the law has ceased to bind hence the reasons for dispensing are either good and sufficient and then nothing is wanted but the declaration or they are bad and then no power on earth can or ought to grant a dispensation now sir it may happen that the reasons for dispensing are too plain and obvious to stand in need of a declaration as is really the case where fraud or violence are made use of to extort an oath and therefore no dispensation is necessary   c from one error you are driven to another the first error is that no oath can be dispensed with to support this you assert another error that all oaths made to god are vows in oaths made to man you again deny a power of dispensing another error but finding that some such oaths admit of a dispensation you take your last refuge under the protection of a new definition of a dispensation and this definition is perhaps as erroneous as any of your former assertions pray sir what orthodox divine ever before gave such a definition even canonisls are not so loose they give the following description of dispensation it is a prudent relaxation of the common law divines however are more accurate and say it is a prudent relaxation of the common law in particular cases where it would otherwise bind this addition is only for the sake of perspicuity for even according to canonisls a dispensation is not a mere declaration that the law ceases but a relaxation of the law then it takes away an obligation which would otherwise subsist were your definition admitted a dispensation could not release or take away any obligation but only declare it already removed now sir let us see a few absurdities which would necessarily follow were there sufficient reasons to grant a dispensation for any of the impediments of matrimony for example for a subdeacon to marry for cousingermans etc etc the law would really be removed previous to the dispensation and should the pope refuse to grant it from whatever motives and the parties marry without a dispensation the marriage would be valid all that could be objected against such a marriage would be that it would be irregular but it could not be void because the law forbidding the union had really ceased a deacon priest or bishop might pretend that he had reasons equally forcible in his favor and by the same reason might marry and might laugh at every command or censure which should be issued against him  i forbear urging this further if you please we will proceed to examine the next and last exceptionable clause in the oath the infallibility of the sovereign pontiss   d agreed but i wish previously to note that we only deny his personal infallibility independent of the general body of the church this supposed i can not see a difficulty it is no part of our religion it is exploded from every university and is not believed by any one on this side the alps protestants think that if we believe the pope to be infallible he may command us to do what he pleases and we are bound to obey to remove this odium we are called upon to renounce this infallibility if we do it it will be one great means of rooting out the inveterate prejudices of our protestant brethren conceived on account of our supposed subjection to the sea of rome   c you are very kind and indulgent to the prejudices of protestants but why content them by halves renounce the infallibility of the church and you will satisfy them completely  the opinion of the sovereign pontiffs infallibility is as harmless as that of the churchs infallibility we are not bound to obey his commands because he is infallible but because he is our lawful superior and this he certainly is whether he is or is not infallible hence we are bound to obey whenever his commands are just though we should abjure this infallibility which you affect to call personal or independent of the body of the church pray sir what is the meaning of this what other infallibility did bellarmine contend for now sir although a person should not allow of any sort of infallibility in his holiness and therefore might lawfully sign a declaration against it yet no one i think can swear against it might he not alter his opinion how then could he take this oath if tendered a second time how terrible the consequence of his refusal should any one believe his holiness possessed of this prerogative he could not take this oath he must then be branded with the titles of a dangerous subject hostile and dangerous to the state in one word he must be a modern papist what folly this and how foreign to an oath of allegiance  but sir this is not all the committee in their letter to the catholics have told us that we are called upon to renounce this opinion among others as a pernicious doctrine page   if the doctrines protested against by the oath be pernicious  the propriety of the expression protesting catholic dissenter is unquestionable what these doctrines are they tell us a few lines below among the rest is that the pope is insallible it is then to be abjured in the oath as a pernicious doctrine will you swear simply and without explication that it is a pernicious doctrine because protestants think it such  by way of confirmation of what i have said before of that odious title i shall remark from the same letter ibid that if by the oath any doctrine be protested against which is not pernicious or a fortiori if any doctrine be protested against which is an article of faith the preamble the title protesting catholic dissenter cannot be acquiesced in by any catholic with a safe conscience they promise to examine later whether any doctrines abjured in the oath be pernicious or articles of faith but this we are yet to look for now sir i will assert   that the doctrine of the popes infallibility will never be proved pernicious to the state   that several other doctrines abjured in the oath are so closely connected with articles of faith that without them faith itself would be altered and this i hope i have proved then sir no catholic can with a safe conscience acquiesce in the title or take the oath   d i think we are now at an end of our examination and i must own that your reasons have not made me a convert let every man therefore think for himself and let him that can take the oath we need not quarrel for this difference of opinion in temporal concerns if your delicacy will not allow you to take the oath you ought not to hinder those who think they ought to stand forth and regain their rights as citizens by removing the odium which inveterate prejudice has caston their religion   c this doctrine is evidently calculated to desend and support a schism among english catholics although what i have said has not convinced you that the oath contains heterodox doctrines you should be convinced that the question between us is not purely of a political and temporal nature no sir it is of a dogmatical fact which must be ultimately submitted to the supreme ecclesiastical court that is whether this oath does or does not contain doctrines which a catholic cannot subscribe to when the sovereign pontiff had condemned the five celebrated propositions of jansenius his followers after some resistance acquiesced in the censure but to support their sinking cause contended that these propositions were not found in the book entitled augustinus this also was condemned by the pope who declared that they were really extracted from the said book in the sense therein expressed you know sir that the church dispersed aquiesced in the sentence and that those who appealed from it to a future general council were ever considered as cut off from the body of the church should the sovereign pontiff declare this oath unlawful to be taken as inconsistent with faith and hostile to salvation if the bishops dispersed were silent would you still think it lawful would you still call it a mere temporal and political concern if so what would become of the infallibility of the church dispersed would not such or suchlike pretenses excuse any schismatic that ever existed indeed sir if this question were decided by the pope and the church dispersed did not reclaim against the sentence i should think myself bound in conscience not only to submit to the decree but also to separate from every refractory person who should  or appeal   finis
