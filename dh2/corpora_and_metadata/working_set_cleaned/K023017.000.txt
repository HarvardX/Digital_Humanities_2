a letter to mr row concerning the nonjuror  price sixpence  a clue to the comedy of the nonjuror  with some hints of consequence relating to that play  in a letter to n row esquire poet laureat to his majesty  quo musa tendis desine pervicax refer sermones deorum  hor london printed for e curll in fleet street       a clue to the comedy of the nonjuror with some hints of consequence relating to that play dear mr row i entirely agree with you that there has not of late appeared in public a more exquisite piece of satire than the comedy called the nonjuror or that better deserved the distinction that was shown it not only by your self as his majestys laureat but by all the loyal party in general i also agree with you that perhaps there never was a piece of fine dramatheological satire the true scope of which has been less understood i am at a loss which to admire most the noble free spirit of our friend the author the insensibility of those whom the satire is really aimed at or the ignorant rage of those dissaffected jacobite wretches who cry out when they are not hurt you were pleased to desire me when we met last to put upon paper the few hints i dropped to you in conversation upon this subject and which i doubt not are sufficient to make any unprejudiced reader of your and my opinion namely  that dissaffection to the government is the smallest immorality which is pointed at by this play and which indeed is only introduced to hide a far deeper design and far more useful satire  in order to set this in it is true light i will but barely point at the several figures of the comedy and make some short remarks upon their attitudes without the illmanners of naming any particular person but leaving the free and impartial reader to draw his own inferences two general observations only are necessary to be premised because every common judge is not so sensible of them as we who have been writers all our lives  the first is that when we rebuke our superiors the fable ought to be so coucnd as to make the criminal give judgment against himself before he is aware an art as ancient at least as the days of nathan but if the scene of action be laid in a subject not only quite foreign but seemingly opposite to the principal aim of the satire the address will be still the more refined because by this method the author introduces facts and personages which the guilty will be sure to condemn not only from natural equity but natural aversion thus for example to engage a tory to condemn a piece of iniquity in the abstract one need only lay the scene among whigs and so on the contrary and secondly i would put the reader in mind that in fables of this nature it is usual to represent whole parties of men by single personages  this premised let us observe the principal figure thar presents it self to our view i mean dr wolf whose character answers to molieres tartuffe who is known to have represented a certain puritanical bishop in france  we next are to take notice that wolf in the style of ecclesiastical allegory constantly signifies the presbyterian party you know it is thus in the hind and panther and most other pieces of controversial divinity or poetry so dr wolf is a presbyterian  dr wolf expects for his services in betraying the church great ecclesiastical preferment as sir john expresses it nonjuror page    an office for life which on whatsoever pretense of misbehaviour no civil government can deprive him of this is ironically represented afterward by the sea of thetford so in short dr wolf is a bishop  this presbyterian bishop has wrote something about the case of schism and the colonel tells his father that he page   has read enough of him in the daily courant what bishop has published in the daily courant is lippis et tonsoribus notum  this bishop protests great zeal for the church at the same time that he is betraying it on which the colonel tells sir john though page   i have always honored your concern for the church i little thought it was for a church that is established no where i e no visible church  this bishop is marked with another strong characteristick managing a dispute with heartly about the nature of prayer that it ought not to be tedious page    outward expression not so absolutely necessary since heaven knew the true intention of the heart page    and then he talks of his own manual of devotions  this bishop also pretends a mighty regard to tender consciences he tells heartly that we page    ought to allure them to what is good by the gentlest easiest means we can nor give the least color of offense to tender consciences  the colonel here urges the constitution against him and the force of the laws and desires him to explain himself to which this bishop answers page    sir i shall not explain my self but make your best of what i have said  but power perhaps may change it is hands and you ere long as little dare to speak your mind as i do viz that there may come a time when this constitution you talk so much of may be overturned  sir john is fully satisfied that the doctor is all this while a page    true stanch member of the english catholic church mark that is such a church as comprehends all sects and parties whatsoever  but lest these lines should not be strong enough the author gives the finishing stroke  this bishop is at last discovered to be a jesuit in disguise by whom by one of his schoolboys in whom he had distilled some of his jesuitical principles and most remarkable it is what the colonel says on this occasion that page    charles begs he will not insist upon the discovery till his circumstances will allow it almost in the very style of some letters that passed upon a parallel occasion between a master of a school and a reverend doctor  at last substantial affadavits are produced to prove dr wolf to have been educated a jesuit by which as it is usual in allegorical writers the close conjunction of a reverend prelate and a certain jesuit is most injuriously and scandalously insinuated  so here is a prelate and a jesuit and his gang got into the family of sir john let us next see what they are to do there why they contrive the ruin of his family and the disinheriting and expulsion of his children with so great an assurance of success that the doctor talks of sir john in this manner page    poor man he knows not his own weakness he is molded into any shape if you but gently stroke his humor i intend to morrow to persuade him it is for the interest of our cause it should be so and then i have him sure poor sir john indeed  i must here put you in mind of my second observation that by the single person of dr wolf without any forced construction may be understood a whole set or party of men to proceed then  the play opens with a dispute between sir john and his daughter about the formality of christening and sir john is at it again page    being extremely rejoiced that heartly is christned according to the right form there is also mention made of searching the register etc  next we see dr wolf insulting sir john s son and daughter he breaks into the daughters bedchamber before she is quite up and when she resents it he tells her page    compose your transport madam i came by your fathers desire for what i have done madam i had your fathers authority and shall leave him to answer you the daughter replies ibid it is false he gave you no authority to insult me what is it you presume upon your function does that exempt you from the manners of a gentleman  at last his foul behavior provokes the son to that degree that he calls him page    villain and rascal  sir john is nettled at this he tells his son and daughter page    i see your aim your malice on your own vile head to me it but the more endears him either submit and ask his pardon for this wrong  or this instant leave my sight my house my family for ever  the son answers page    though i would hazard life to save you from the ruin he misleads you to could die to reconcile my duty to your favor yet on the terms that villain offers it is merit to refuse it i glory in the disgrace your errors give me  in short sir johns attachment to dr wolf was so great that there appeared but small hopes of ever opening sir johns eyes and remarkable is the lamentation of the son upon that occasion page    what horrid hands is this poor family fallen into how little is my father like himself by nature open just and generous but this vile hypocrite drives his weak passions like the wind and i foresee at last will dash him on his ruin  when dr wolf had wrought up the passion of sir john to this degree as to turn his children out of doors then he interposeth his good offices and proposes a reconciliation  i beg the reader to observe the terms of it that his child should be at the sole disposal of dr wolf and do nothing without his consent  it must here be observed that the daughter had a fortune of her own independent on the father upon which she seems to value her self page   have not i  000l in my own hands have not i had the full swing of my own airs and humors these four years mark the precise time but she is put in mind by the son that though the father could not deprive her of her fortune he might abridge her equipage in these words ibid however a fathers consent might have clapped a pair of horses more to your coach  but at last he applauds her resolution and tells her she speaks with the spirit of a freeborn englishman  mark now the modesty of dr wolf he proposes as the lowest and last condition that she should resign the half of this independent fortune page    is not two thousand pounds worth two thousand pounds is not half better than nothing  observe next good mr row how dr wolf endeavors to debauch lady woodvill and make her subservient to his villainous designs this lady is described as having a great ascendant over sir johns spirit that she keeps no assemblys that she had been poor and beautiful while sir john was rich and amourous this lady proves honest and trusty and contributes in the conclusion to the discovery of the wicked purposes of dr wolf  pray take notice too of a very odd episode that seem to contribute very little to the main action that is dr wolfs endeavoring to bring sir john into a scheme of church comprehension referring again to his case of schism he tells sir john that page    differences are not so material as some would represent them ah could we be brought to a temper a great many seeming contradictions might be reconciled i allow this is a comprehension of a different kind but i beg leave to remind you and my readers of my first observation that the circumstances of a fable do not determine the satire but you sir who are intimate with mr cibber may examine and know the truth of this  nothing is so plain as the catastrophe when dr wolf thought himself sure of his blow and had brought sir john to believe that his page    hot brained son as he calls him had a design to get his estate he instantly makes sir john resolve to repay it in kind by disinheriting him  but at last there arises a misfortune from a corner where the doctor least suspected it some of his own party whom he thought inviolably attached to his interests discover his wicked purposes this set of men is represented by charles an ingenious gentleman a servant of sir johns a man of business a good greek and latin scholar etc this charles it seems highly obliged by the generous treatment of the son and enamored of the good qualities of the daughter both reveals and prevents the whole mystery of iniquity upon which dr wolf seeing his project dissappointed vents his rage upon this honest gentleman and attempts his life  lastly mr cibber to obviate all possibility of mistaking his meaning upon the winding up of the whole design breaks on a sudden into an open discourse of politics talks of embroiling the nation and ending public disputes and calls upon king george with abundance more good morality very well worth observing  thus sir according to your desire i have given a short sketch of the fable and characters of this play just enough to enable some person of greater sagacity to find out who are meant by every particular personage of the drama i am sure i would not presume so much as to guess  but one thing i must observe which i remember we both took particular notice of it is that the author though questionless a great master of style puts bad english into the mouths of most of his personages so that indeed scarce any of them talk at all like english folks but perpetually make use of an uncorrect foreign jargon what his drift is in this i cannot imagine but the instances of it are obvious to every reader and numerous
