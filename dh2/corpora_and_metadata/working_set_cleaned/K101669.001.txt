is gone yes by all the honest powers who frown on the unsightly union of age and youth of decrepitude and beauty he is departed  aye my friend departed like a shadow as he seemed to be to the region of spirits that hour for which you have heard me pant so frequently with all the fervency of an impassioned soul that blessed hour is at length arrived  cornelia the lovely the tender the patient the dutiful cornelia is delivered from her egyptian bondage cornelia is a widow and what a widow oh heavens a thousand times more able to exercise and to gratify the imperial passion of my heart than all the boasted virgins that circassia could exhibit you have heard me to rave on her graces her virtues her enchantment and with true philosophical phlegm or with a friendly design perhaps to divert me from what you considered as a very hopeless attachment you have told me that my heart is the dupe of my own feverish imagination yes you argumentative rogue i perfectly remember how you employed against my passion the united powers of logic and of ridicule i see you at this moment with that singular variable and interesting face of yours in which the rigid frown of zeno is perpetually mingling with the wanton smile of epicurus i see you arranging your tremendous syllogisms and preparing to tell me once more that one of your two positions must be true that either cornelia was never half so lovely as i have represented her or if she was once indeed a perfect model of loveliness that her charms must have withered like the leaves of an unfortunate rose barbarously stationed under the deadly shade of a decaying yew tree  i have not you find either forgot or forgiven the abominable metaphor by which you tried like a rough empiric as you are to cure my heart by disgusting my fancy a sort of quackery that is i must confess very frequently successful and practiced with mavelous effect by the women in their attempts to annihilate the influence of a rival but let me tell you profane wretch as you are aurora springing from tithonus bed was never half so fresh so enchanting so divine as my angelical widow  i call her mine because i feel that i shall be frantic if i cannot make her so yet that pious barbarian your brother charles told me the other day with a sacerdotal assurance that i had not religion enough to deserve or maintain her confound his presumption were he of any family but yours i should think him the grossest of hypocrites because he has married the fair buxom daughter of a pompous high priest the rogue assumes all the arrogance of the catholic church and thinks he has a right to send to purgatory all who presume to act or to think in a style that differs from his own he teaches us to be sure by his example a most orthodox system of happiness for he kisses no woman but his wife reads no book but the bible and labors hard to reinforce the militia of heaven with a new party of cherubims as his good woman after making him a present of twins but a few months ago looks already as if she intended to double that favor deuce take the fellow while i am laughing at him i am almost ready to envy his felicity and i ought indeed to tell you that with his insolent rebuke to me which i have mentioned he mingled such an air of concern and benevolence that i felt a strange sort of momentary doubt in my mind whether i ought to challenge or to embrace him as it generally happens in the disagreeable perplexity of a mixed and equivocal sentiment i did nothing yet had i been hypocritical or discreet enough to pursue my own interest in spite of a ruffled spirit i certainly ought to have embraced him as the dearest friend i have in the world since i am sufficiently aware that he will have great influence on the future destination of my enchanting widow you know i suppose that as he was the favorite relation of mr sedley he makes a most important figure in his will as his confidential trustee for the young widow and those two lovely infants whom she seemed to have made miraculously without any assistance of her unequal partner pious as he is i really believe your brother will manage their ample property with a faithful discharge of his trust if i thought him indeed inclined to play the jew or the priest for with me i confess they are almost synonymous i would willingly give him all the wealth of the widow to secure me the rapid possession of her heart and hand yet i have such a rooted detestation of artifice and falsehood that i could not play the pious hypocrite with him for an hour if i knew it would make me master of the object i adore  i must however contrive to associate as much as possible with your brother and the more so as his wife is the bosom friend of my cornelia pray write me word instantly if your sister lucy is now residing with you i hope from the bottom of my soul that she is as i know that she and your sister charles never pass a week without writing to each other it is from this quarter alone that i can at present gain a little unsuspected insight into the heart and spirit of my dear cornelia i conjure you by our friendship to obtain for me all possible information concerning her plan of life her thoughts her feelings and every minute article relating to her observe this request as you wish not only to promote the happiness but to preserve the existence of  your affectionate etc  letter ii from edmund audley to henry seymour i rejoice with you indeed my dear seymour but i confess it is with a fearful joy  you know that i am naturally subject to an anxious timidity concerning those i regard and if my sympathy in your present transport appears too much chastised by apprehension you will i hope impute what you may at first consider as a deficiency of spirit to an excess of affection  in truth you are not only in the very limited number of my dearest confidential friends but you are the very friend whose peculiar qualities and situation have filled me for some time with the most affectionate solicitude  i own to you that i tremble lest the mischievous power of chance should conspire with some of your peculiarities i should rather say with your only defect to counteract all the noble advantages you possess what young man ever entered the world with more abundant means to render it a scene of cheerfulness and delight you have an excellent constitution with an engaging figure you have an ample fortune without a single encumbrance you have a gay and brilliant imagination you have a warm a benevolent heart but allow the frowning stoic to add you have a precipitancy of spirit which may rapidly convert all these instruments or happiness into sources of miery  but i abuse the privilege you allow me of preaching against your foibles in giving you a dull unreasonable sermon when a little timely railler might not only be more pleasant but more efficacious instead therefore of continuing my dictatorial harangue on your imperfection let me only advise you not to write an offer of marriage to your widow while she is adjusting her weeds nor a challenge to my brother in consequence of that insupportable provocation  his feeling a sincere wish to see you a good christian  though you tell me i love to touch your foibles wih the caustic of sarcasm i find that i cannot just with any tolerable grace or ease on subjects that may press upon my heart with such serious weight  there is hardly a circumstance in life which could give me more pain than a quarrel between you and my brother and when i consider your respective situations i shudder at the probability of such an event it would certainly be most impolitic in you to offend him at present yet you have such an exalted idea of never sacrificing your sentiments to your interest that my caution to you on this ground might he more likely to produce than to prevent the mischief i would guard against as i have a most cordial affection both for you and my brother and a much more intimate knowledge of both than you have yet acquired of each other allow me to inform you that although you differ on one great subject there are many points of agreement and resemblance beween you that ought to unite us all in a very firm and inviolable friendship it was your lot as you approached toward manhood to be connected with some mercenary priests both in humble and high station whose ungenerous conduct inspired or rather inflamed you with a vehement prejudice not only against their whole order but against all persons who are very zealously attached to the religion they profess youth and pleasure have not hitherto allowed your reason sufficient time to examine and correct this early this unfortunate prejudice and accident perhaps has repeatedly conspired with the native ardor of your mind to strengthen the honest indignant feelings on which it was founded my brother charles though he has neither the habit nor the occupations of a divine is indeed a man of as religious a mind as the church can exhibit but his religion if i may use such a distinction is rather constitutional than acquired it arises more from tenderness of heart and sensibility of mind than from extensive study and profound meditation his piety is the child of gratitude not of fear and its chief characteristics are cheerfulness and benevolence it is his favorite maxim that religion not only takes from us the bitter sense of calamity but gives a finer zest to all the pleasures of life his doctrine is indeed very forcibly recommended by his example for he is by many degrees the most happy being that i ever knew  we all talk you know of god as our general parent but few of us i fear are able to look up to him with a true filial spirit of all the men whom i have had occasion to observe in this point of view charles i must say is the only person who ever seemed to repose with the happy affectionate confidence of an innocent child on the bosom of his creator  you will begin to suspect that i am metamorphosed into a moravian or at least that i have caught my brothers enthusiasm without his vivacity but to confess my own weakness they are equally beyond ray reach connected as we are by nature and by affection i find there is such an unalterable difference in our characters that i might as well attempt to acquire the exact turn of his features as the peculiar cast of his mind when i am in one of my argumentative metaphysical moods i reason myself into a consolatory persuasion that his great superiority over me both in goodness and gaiety is principally owing to a mechanical felicity of frame  but i am rambling very far from the main object of my letter which is to conjure you not to indulge your wit and imagination in any satirical sallies against the church and her sons in the presence of my brother i do not pretend to say he is right in his maxim that piety is an essential ingredient in a good husband the ladies we know are ready enough to grant a dispensation on this article but of this i am sure if charles is once convinced that you are possessed with the spirit of outrageous irreligion he will la our hard to preserve your lovely widow from a connection which in his idea must be productive of misery both to her and her children if i thought you an absolute debauchee i should be very fearful of giving you such a hint because i know in that case what your answer or at least what your conduct would be you would engage the amorous wishes of the widow in a conflict with the pious advice of her guardian for the pleasure of watching the battle and discovering which would be triumphant but though we have both of us had more resemblance to the libertine than to the anchorite in our adventures i am persuaded that you have a true and chaste affection for this divine little widow and of course you can never feel a wish to fill her tender bosom with painful disquietude and contention when fortune seems to offer you the tranquil acquisition of her heart and hand when i thought that your admiration of her charms could only involve you in a hopeless or a dangerous attachment i endeavored to laugh away your love but the great change in your cornelias situation has turned me from an opponent into an advocate for your passion i have now only to conjure you not to throw any stumbling black yourself into the very inviting primrose path that is just opened before you i can truly say to encourage you that you have as many advantages for the chase of a widow as a greyhound has for that of a hare but remember the greyhound is sometimes apt to overrun his game and to lose his prey by the very rapdiy which seemed to ensure it i foresee and acquiesce in the justice of your retort that i have the slow foot of a beagle and frequently suffer the object of my wishes to escape me by the tardiness of my pursuit agreed but pray recollect what a very useful assistant the flow dog often proves to the swift one  that i am highly anxious for your success you will clearly perceive by my writing you so long a letter without touching on my own less delicate amors indeed i should think it almost a profanation of your divine cornelia if i presumed to talk of the wayward sylvia in the same page i will only add therefore that having been wickedly tormented by a mistress i am particularly solicitous to see you religiously happy in a wife and let me close that friendly wish with a devout amen  ps you will think i am proving the truth of an old saying which tells us all the pith of a letter is contained in the postscript when i inform you here that my sister lucy is with me and that i engage for her being as much the patroness of your affection as the duties and punctilios of female friendship will allow her to be    letter iii from cornelia sedley to harriot audley alas my most tender and dearest friend what a bitter misfortune to me is the provoking little accident which has confined you to your chamber at a time when my heart and soul have such pressing occasions for your society  surely i am destined to be for ever ungrateful for is there not much ingratitude in this complaint considering the kind and brotherly attention that i receive from your excellent husband and the affectionate manner in which you press him to remain at a distance from you so long as his presence here can be any way serviceable to me and my dear little orphans your own heart will witness for me that i do him only simple justice in saying that no man in the world could discharge the mournful office in which he has so graciously engaged with more delicate propriety or with more soothing friendship indeed i know not how poor cornelia could have supported her existence without him for in the week preceding mr sedleys death a scene passed between us which annihilated all the little strength of body and mind with which i had endeavored to prepare myself for that most aweful expected event you will conceive the impression it made upon me when i tell you that i have sat down four different days with a firm resolution to give you a minute account of it and that i have been repeatedly prevented by the bursting tears of anguish and selfreproach  ah my dear harriot had you been a witness of that distressing conversation you would no more take the part of your selfreproaching cornelia no you would certainly join with my own heart in telling me that as i was not happy in being connected with so noble so elegant so affectionate a mind as my departed sedleys i can never deserve happiness on earth good heaven how strangely does the capricious human spirit administer to its own disquietude how silly a wretch have i been to live six years with such a man and not love him with true affection till the very moment in which he seemed to hover in a middle state between earth and heaven in truth he was much more of an angel than a mortal in the heartpiercing conversation i have mentioned and of which i will now endeavor to give you the most exact narrative in my power  i should begin by informing you that his gloomy and querulous disposition which we found you know so grievous and oppressive in the early periods of his long disorder changed on a sudden into a kind of seraphic serenity under pain which excited in all his attendants admiration and reverence as soon as he found by a fair trial that the waters at bristol had not the slightest effect on that internal uncertain malady which had so often deceived his physicians and preyed in so singular a manner on his wasting frame his mind seemed to pass from a turbulent state of suspense to a tranquil certainty he was convinced for the first time that he was very soon to die and the conviction instead of weakening appeared to give new energy to his spirits his faculties and his affections represent to yourself my dear harriot his wasted yet manly figure ten times more emaciated than when you last beheld him and his piercing eyes endued as it were with a supernatural keenness that seemed to search the soul of every person on whom he turned them behold him wrapped in his loose coat of blue velvet which you sportively used to call his imperial robe and reclining on a sopha in a silent conflict with internal pain behold your cornelia preparing for her morning task of reading to the poor sufferer after the removal of our breakfast at which he had endured as usual extreme torture on the first reception of a little food into his stomach his pangs had subsided and he had made me a signal to open the volume of shakspeare which i held in my hand when instead of obeying it immediately i ventured to say if you are persuaded that bristol does not suit your complaint why do you not move from an inconvenient lodging into one of your own comfortable houses he fixed upon me those eyes of inexpressible quickness and after a moments pause he replied i will tell you my dear cornelia very frankly i wish to die here because i wish to leave you no vestiges of a wretched scene in either of those habitations where i hope you are soon to lead a life of quiet and in due time of joy his expression struck me in a manner which it is impossible for me to describe i felt in it a mixture of the tenderest solicitude and of half disguised reproach it distressed me to such a degree that i could not utter a syllable but my face i believe was covered with an halfguilty blush and tears started into my eyes he observed my confusion with pity and drew me hastily toward him while he was affectionately pressing one of my hands the book slipped from the other and accidentally fell open his quick eye darted on the page before him and he instantly exclaimed here are words that suit my present feelings exactly it is my wish to deserve this character from you my dear cornelia and to leave it engraven on your heart nothing in his life became him like the leaving it  he died as one that had been studied in his death   i have indeed no treasons to confess but i have pardon to implore let me now say to you my dearest cornelia what pride and ill humor have hitherto prevented my saying as i ought  let me say that i most cordially implore your pardon for many many sensations of pain and depression with which the peevish and morose spirit of my distemper for i will not call it mine has unjustly afflicted you this tender unexpected humiliation of an imperious though affectionate mind pierced me to the soul i sunk to the ground and bathing his hands with my tears i replied very truly that his malady was an excuse for every thing but that a creature whom heaven blessed with constant health and who failed in the duty of patient and cheerful tenderness to the sick  he interrupted me with the kindest emotion and raising me to his bosom he exclaimed by heaven you have never failed  your life since our marriage has been a perfect model of virtue though not of happiness my tears gushed with a vehemence that i could not disguise at this unmerited encomium i was on the point of confessing to him what i have so often lamented to you my too tender and indulgent confessor that although guiltless of any actual offense i have often been such a wretch as to murmur in secret at my destiny though i formed it myself in a voluntary and cheerful compliance with the wishes of a most affectionate father a dread of giving unnecessary pain to my generous sedley prevented my relieving my overburthened heart by so frank an avowal of all its unworthiness i only intimated in words which my agitation i believe rendered hardly intelligible that if heaven would spare his life to my prayers i would show myself more thankful for the blessing than i had hitherto been he now seated me by his side in a manner that expressed the tenderest solicitude to tranquillize my spirits be calm he cried i conjure you my dear cornelia for it is of great importance to the present relief of my mind and to your future happiness that i should have a long and unreserved conversation with you i sat silent and half petrified with awful expectation i have wished he continued for some days to enter on this discourse and i feel that i must not let slip the present hour because it is most probable that i shall not have another in which i may possess ease and strength of body sufficient to utter all i would say to you no my dear cornelia you must not think of my recovery there is not indeed a shadow of foundation for any hope of that kind  and believe me i am willing to die  my affection for you strange as it may sound has a tendency to favor a turn of mind so desirable in a state like mine i have wished very ineffectually to make you happy your excellent father had the same passionate desire and as he had also a strong abhorrence for the profligate manners of our young men and a fond anxiety to guard you from the miseries of conjugal infidelity he gave you at seventeen to the arms of his particular friend whose integrity he considered as much more than a compensation for the difference of our age  that difference indeed was not painfully visible at the period of our union but every succeeding year rendered it more apparent and accident conspired with time and nature to preclude us from that felicity which he had fondly persuaded himself we were destined to enjoy flattered by the alacrity with which you obeyed the wish of a father whom you idolized i was vain enough to suppose that you loved me before i had in truth merited your tenderness eager to improve your admirable understanding i began to play the preceptor too soon and too sedulously i bestowed that time and care on the cultivation of your mind which i ought to have devoted to the acquisition of your heart i did not perceive my error and its very natural consequence till i had been visited for some time by the severe internal malady which has long rendered my existence so painful to myself and so burdensome to all around me  you my dearest cornelia have been a very diligent and a very kind attendant to a wretched invalid but your own heart will inform you that i am not mistaken in saying you have been so much more from the sense of duty than from the sentiment of love  do not i conjure you suppose that i mean to cast a shadow of reproach upon you by what i am saying on the contrary i consider myself as making a just acknowledgment to the excellence of your conduct there is assuredly more virtue in discharging very burdensome and painful duties with the strictest fidelity than in merely acting from the impulse of an ardent affection yet when i have observed your lively spirit depressed and at times even the loveliness of your countenance impaired by being involved so early in offices illsuited to your youth i have almost thought it a crime in me to labor for the preservation of a life whose continuance could only lengthen your misfortune he uttered these words with such an enthusiastic mixture of tenderness and despair that i could remain silent no longer  i know not however what i attempted to utter for he soon restrained my end avour to take a part in the conversation by requesting me to hear what he wished to say of our children a subject which he had long been unable to touch upon without a very painful and distressing emotion after some affectionate remarks on their infantine dispositions they have he said and i hope they will long have a mother to whom nature has given every perfection that belongs to the maternal character but as it is possible that when they will stand most in need of paternal admonition they may find only a nominal father whose parental solicitude may be engrossed by more fortunate children  as he was uttering his apprehension i felt a sort of proud anguish and affectionate indignation that i was unable to suppress and i interrupted him with a vehemence of manner so different from my usual behavior to him that he gazed at me in silent astonishment while i exclaimed i see the full extent and cruelty of your fears o sedley if i have hitherto failed in affection let me now give you a convincing proof that you are much dearer to me than you imagine if it will afford any relief to the fond parental anxiety that afflicts you i will bind myself by any form of adjuration or engagement you can prescribe to live only for your children and never whatever offers may tempt me to marry a second time  no words my dear harriot can give you a complete idea of the effect which this sudden unexpected and you i know will call it romantic testimony of genuine attachment produced on the dear invalid  starting up in a wild agitation of delight and looking indeed like a being just transported from the grave into paradise he exclaimed no thou divinest of women i am not such a selfish wretch as to form a wish so inhuman  then drawing me forcibly in his emaciated arms to a pierglass at some distance from his sopha look there my angel he continued look there and let the beautiful image in the mirror inform you what a despicable brute i must be if sensible as i am that you have never yet experienced the delicious passion of love i could suffer you to make such a sacrifice to generosity as your angelic soul has suggested no  but my cornelia i am referring you to a monitor unfaithful to my purpose however true that reflection may be to the beauties of your person your native dissidence will render it a weak interpreter of my meaning turn then to me alone and believe the voice of a dying man who tells you in a state which admits not any species of adulation that you are at this moment both in person and in mind one of the most lovely creatures with which the great parent of all loveliness has deigned to embellish this world why do i tell you this  for the kindest of purposes to impress on your own mind a juster estimate of the perfections you possess that seeing at once their rare value and the various dangers to which they may expose their possessor you may render them no more the sources of disquietude but the instruments of happiness not marry again oh heavens my dearest cornelia it is my ardent prayer that you may and in such a manner that your second marriage may afford you the fullest compensation for all the inevitable infelicity of the first  here his voice failed him and a fit of his severe agony came on so suddenly that i was terrified with the idea of his expiring as he leant exhausted and speechless against my bosom i contrived however to replace him on his sopha and after some dreadful writhing of his poor tortured frame he resumed his discourse with an astonishing coherence and composure in vain i conjured him not to destroy his reviving strength by farther conversation on a subject at once so distressing and so unnecessary i am convinced my dear cornelia he replied that at this moment you believe it unnecessary but the day perhaps may come when you will reflect upon it as a useful caution with affectionate gratitude having been an unworthy partner to you in life i am the more anxious to have a friendly and beneficent influence on your thoughts when i have ceased to live do not shrink from my discourse with such an appearance of distress  i have but little more to say but that little may be of great importance to you hear it therefore i conjure you and as the subject is indeed too affecting to us both i will then dismiss it for ever  you have little experience of the world you have naturally an open lively unsuspecting temper you are still so young that your beauty striking as it is has not yet perhaps attained its perfection you are hitherto forgive me for repeating this important truth you are hitherto a stranger to the passion which your bosom is naturally formed to feel in the very height of its purity and its power  a passion my dear cornelia which even in a heart so virtuous and so gentle as yours is forcible and imperious to a degree that you can hardly conceive  no by heaven so far from wishing to withhold you from a future marriage had i the powers of an angel i would exert them to select for you an object that should render you the happiest of wives i have not such a privilege but i can at least caution you against the kind of character that would have the greatest tendency to produce the opposite effect  vice my dear cornelia is a still greater enemy to happiness than a lingering distemper  heaven forbid that you should ever be the wife of a man whose profligacy might induce you to regret your departed invalid  you must indeed be egregiously deceived before this could happen but how common is such deception in the world how many men have i known extolled by their acquaintance for infinite honesty of heart and high sentiments of honor yet practicing every device that could be productive of misery to your sex and caressed by the polite world in proportion as they merited universal detestation what examples have we of husbands who married with every possible advantage of rank fortune understanding and person united in either party yet who have wantonly sacrificed every blessing to a rage for licentious pleasure and have left a lovely woman to ruin her health by dissipation or to pine in solitude over her declining beauty and her deserted children  but is there any kind of caution which a woman may consider as her safeguard against misery like this  yes my dear cornelia there is one a very simple one which has chiefly induced me to trouble you with this long discourse  let this i conjure you be the leading maxim of your life that he can never be a proper partner for a lovely and innocent woman who has no sense of his obligations to her creator  it is my hope and my ardent prayer that you may never bestow your invaluable self on any man however engaging his accomplishments and however numerous his good qualities may be if his mind is avowedly destitute of religion perceiving that his weak frame was exhausted to the most alarming degree by the great exertion of talking so long on a subject that pressed with so much weight upon his heart i seized with great eagerness the opportunity of replying i assured him that since the hour of my birth no words had ever made an impression at once so aweful and so tender on my mind as those which he had just uttered i said this with the strictest truth and indeed my dear harriot i question if the voice of an angel giving me counsel from heaven could have filled my retentive mind with such grateful admiration nor can i think it would have deserved to do so for though a celestial spirit descending from a state of beatitude to caution an endangered mortal might dazzle us in the extreme and excite our reverence and gratitude yet i hope it is not profane to say that in the eyes of affection and of reason there is something still more admirable in a being who after his temper had been ruined by lingering disease and his body wasted by incessant pain instead of being oppressed or engrossed by any dread of increasing tortures and impending death collected and strained all his faculties to bestow the purest advice that the lips of friendship could utter on a woman who had little merited such affectionate such a generous attention oh harriot if i formerly beheld him with ungrateful indifference he is now the object of my idolatry alas what tears have i shed in reflecting that the cause of my not loving him as i ought to have done was my own unworthiness and the not possessing a spirit so noble as his  but i am wandering from my promise which was to give you a very full and complete narration of our conference  i told him that although i sincerely hoped and believed i should not marry again yet i should treasure up his counsel as children do a rich and beautiful pocketpiece not for use but for frequent contemplation as an engaging and valuable memorial of regard and affection i was on the point of uttering a very solemn promise on the religious article he mentioned when his physician entered the room  enough my dear cornelia cried the generous sedley and addressing himself immediately to his medical friend he said with an air of calm christian triumph in his countenance you find me doctor as your benevolent spirit would wish to find a patient whom no art can restore you find me with a bosom greatly relieved by having just said all that i was anxious to say in this world i thank heaven and this divine attendant here he pointed to the unworthy cornelia with a tone and gesture so affecting that it made me fly to hide my face at the window i am now so perfectly prepared to die and so weary of these wasting pains that i should esteem it a favor if you could announce to me the certain hour of my release  i now quitted the room as i found myself unable to suppress my tears and indeed i had great occasion to give vent to them in privacy during the greater part of my poor sedleys discourse to me my whole frame was agitated with a conflict of opposite sensations of reverence and regret admiration of him and abhorrence of myself my heart indeed made several efforts to relieve itself by tears but they were repeatedly checked by the reflection that it was ungenerous and cruel to indulge them in his presence with him therefore i wept but little as soon as i had escaped to my own chamber i began to weep indeed like a penitent who wished to efface the offenses of many years reflecting however that i had still a more painful duty to discharge i prayed most devoutly for strength and spirits to watch over the poor sufferer with the most tender and incessant attention through every remaining hour of a life so rapidly hastening to its close i felt most sensibly on this occasion that but to ask more goodness is to gain for i soon returned to the poor object of my prayer with the powers of my mind amazingly recruited it is well for me that they were so as on opening the door of his apartment i was struck with a scene that at first led me to suppose he had expired in my absence this however was not the case but the poor exhausted patient had sunk into a little slumber which his humane physician had requested him to indulge with a promise to sit watching by his side his late exertion had very visibly produced a considerable diminution of his strength and the physician enjoined me to keep him as quiet as possible we religiously obeyed this injunction which was given on the thursday and i believe he did not utter ten words on the two following days but on the fatal sunday he requested me to join him in a short and fervent prayer which he had composed and written for the purpose  i could hardly articulate the words which he pronounced in a low voice yet very distinctly though at that moment the cold sweat of death was standing on his forehead in taking the paper from him as he ended his devotion i kissed his hand which was indeed like clay when looking at me with inexpressible kindness and anxiety he said remember my dear cornelia remember that the caution i have given you is not only important to yourself but to our children  the last word he could only speak in a confused murmur and thus he expired in a sudden short agony of parental tenderness  oh my dear harriot if it is possible that your cornelia can ever become such a wretch as to let the just impression of all i have now related to you be effaced from her heart be you my monitor remind me  but no it is not possible or if it were so will not the two dear little beings whom the departed angel has left me serve me as perpetual remembrancers of his divine solicitude and affection for us all  alas how little are they aware of the loss they have sustained how affecting is the simplicity and ignorance of deep sorrow which infants discover to those who are laboring under the pressure of recent grief when i flew to the dear orphans on my return from bristol they caught indeed the infection of my tears which flew afresh at the sight of the little fatherless creatures but in the few days that have elapsed since my arrival here they seem to have lost not only all traces of sorrow but all memory of the dead in such a mere infant as charles this is perfectly natural but william surely is old enough to show more feeling and recollection  but what a wretch am i to blame my poor child when i ought rather to consider how often i have failed myself in affectionate duty to the departed i wish my children to be gay and happy and yet i am such a fool as to be wounded by the sight of the very cheerfulness that i wish them to enjoy oh harriot my mind is full of nothing but confused and uneasy sensations it is only your voice the voice of true sympathy and friendship that can calm my ruffled spirits and reconcile me to myself  your dear audley is all goodness to me and you know i think him a man who has hardly his equal in the world but i believe the most tender and accomplished of men have no comprehension of the thousand little depressive and turbulent feelings that agitate the heart of a woman who is dissatisfied with herself but as audley knows that no human being has manners more soothing than our beloved harriot he has kindly pressed me to relinquish my design of going immediately to sedleyhall for the more comfortable plan of returning with him to you  as he tells me there is the greatest chance that the accident which happened to your foot may confine you for some weeks to a couch i please myself with the idea that i shall be the partner of your confinement and assist in your recovery the feeling audley insists on our bringing both my little orphans with us and i am confident they will both be as welcome to my tender and warmhearted friend as her desolate and affectionate  cornelia as we shall have settled our dismal but necessary business in a few days i shall not write again  indeed it would be unconscionable in me to do so as you will hardly have time to get through the melancholy volume i am now dispatching to you before you see us i am the less disposed to apologize for the enormous length of my letter as audley is so busy in the kind discharge of his trust that he will only be able as he tells me to send you a short billet    letter iv mr to mrs audley my dearest harriot has a spirit to consider my thorough occupation in the service of her friend as a pleasing attention to herself pray have the goodness to accept this not only as a sufficient but as a handsome apology for a brief epistle from him whose heart has always a great deal to say to you  we have in truth much serious business to get through before we can return to you i say we  because you will find that i have persuaded your too feeling cornelia for whom you are so anxious to seek present shelter for herself and her little ones under your friendly wing as i know how full of solicitude you are concerning her after i have recommended to your immediate attention a certain fair creature with a crippled foot who is the only being in the world that you are too apt to neglect i must assure you that although your friend has been much harrassed in mind and fatigued in body i cannot perceive any material diminution either in her health or beauty nor can i find more than a single fault in her whole composition and that is a great tendency to load her innocent self with iniquitous reproaches  in another woman i might perhaps be tempted to think this affectation but i know it is in your cornelia as you have truly told me an excess of real sensibility it is most certain that all her conduct to the poor unhappy man just released has not only been irreproachable but highly meritorious for to speak freely of his infirmities his distemper had rendered him peevish to such an excess that had heaven itself furnished him with an attendant he would have scolded the poor seraph for flapping even celestial plumes by the side of his couch  i lamented his calamity and revered his virtues but though common humanity teaches us to forgive and pity the plaintive asperity of disease i could not i own have attended my unfortunate relation with the unwearied patience of your cornelia  of all human defects that exist without a bad heart a querulous disposition is to me the most unamiable  in health and in sickness it is surely inconsistent with reason and religion it is in short my aversion and if my lovely harriot herself could acquire a habit of murmuring at the evils of life instead of supporting them with that gentle and cheerful fortitude for which she is famous i am apprehensive that all her other perfections would not render her so inexpressily dear as she now is to  her faithful and affectionate etc p s i ought in justice to add that poor sedleys behavior in the three last days of his life might atone for the peevishness of his three last years he died indeed like a man but i feel that i should love his memory more if i could say with the same truth that he lived so when i observe the sincerity and the depth of cornelias concern for him i feel angry with him that he did not render her life more easy as i am confident he might have done so in spite of his personal calamity i must tell you however that in his will he has said and done for her every thing that could be expressive of gratitude esteem and confidence adieu  depend on seeing us on saturday    letter v from henry seymour to edmund audley i have seen  i have talked with  i have touched her and the fire of that electrical touch is still dancing in my veins though i am sitting supperless in a dismal inn where instead of hastening either to supper or to bed as the time of night would induce any less amorous or more fortunate mortal to do i seize the stump of a pen that has served i suppose a hundred travelers to write their adventures to give you a history of mine  ah if your inhuman brother were not as cruel as a priest i should have enjoyed the happiness of passing this night under the roof that protects my adored cornelia  yet i must say the pious barbarian behaved very handsomely all things considered  let me however grow a little more methodical and tell you these interesting occurrences in their due order  to avail myself with the best grace imaginable of your kind hint where i might catch a sight of my cornelia i ordered post horses before i had perfectly perused your friendly letter and hastened to the house of a certain honest dull squire who resides about thirty miles west of your brother and who with many pressing invitations could never tempt me before to pay him a shooting visit here i did penance for three days my good host you know has a head like his gunbarrel full of nothing but powder and shot but had he possessed the wit of athens and the urbanity of rome i should i believe have thought him a woeful companion while he detained me from that dear object of my idolatry to whom my spirit had fled before my limbs could reach her at last the three days that appeared to me three centuries expired and i set forth for your brothers heavens what a variety of inexpressible sensations i felt in passing sedleyhall the sight of the hatchment the open windows of cornelias chamber and every object of the spot struck in some forcible manner on my heart and produced altogether a strange agitation in which hope and fear melancholy and exultation were whimsically blended i felt i know not what satisfaction in contemplating this deserted abode of the lovely mourner that i wish to make the smiling scene of our future felicity yet as i passed the recent grave of poor sedley i felt a cold involuntary pang shoot athwart my bosom  were i inclined to superstition i should say that his spirit smote me as i crossed his tomb and forbade me to indulge the ambition of my heart but my love is too warm and vigorous to be repressed by phantoms were a legion of ghosts to rise in her defense they should not bar me from my pursuit indeed such a legion would not be half so formidable as that single watchful dragon  your brother i believe it was a scurvy dread of encountering his keen eyes in too long a teteatete before dinner which tempted me to loiter so in the precincts of sedleyhall i requested permission of the old porter there to avail myself of the private road which leads through a little string of farms by which sedley and your brother have very lately connected their respective domains i contrived to reach charless gate just as the first bell was summoning the good folks of his household to a preparation for dinner and as i entered the hall i met him just come in through the gardendoor from a long and dirty walk i felt i must confess more like a thief than a friend but putting the best face i could on my unexpected intrusion i told him i had taken the liberty of stopping to dine with him in my road from the west  he gave me a very polite welcome i thought i discovered in it more of civility than of joy and this idea did not tend to diminish my embarrassment but to my inexpressible relief in a few minutes he left me alone in his library while he retired to change his dress my heart now began to palpitate at the sound of a female foot in the room above i had not dared to enquire after the widow and he perhaps from delicacy had not named her to me a servant luckily entering the library i seized the opportunity of inquiring if there was any company in the house and if mrs audley was sufficiently recovered from her late accident to dine below the fellows answer was so exactly what i wished that i considered him as my good angel and was ready to worship him for his blessed intellgence in crossing the hall at the sound of the second bell i caught the first sight of my angelic cornelia employed angellike in supporting the uneasy step of her disabled friend i had the delight of gazing on them for a minute unperceived as they came slowly down stairs in my first compliment i could not help remarking the very touching graces of the position in which i surprised them and i expressed my wonder that the painters had not more frequently seized a subject so delightful as that of one lovely woman engaged in some act of friendly assistance to another o cried your lively sister i am afraid the painters like the greater part of your sex are a set of wicked creatures who have no faith in female friendship but you have luckily hit on a most seasonable piece of flattery for i was saying to my kind friend here this morning that if we ever fit for our pictures again it shall be in the characters of celia and rosalind for my part she continued with that graceful vivacity which she possesses you know in a singular degree i think there is more female heroism in confining yourself to wait on a cripple than in wandering with an exile through the pleasant forest of arden my heart and tongue were both eager to exclaim how blessed the man who might become the oliver to your celia but the sudden appearance of your brother annihilated at once my courage and my compliment our dinner i believe would have passed very heavily had not your engaging sister gradually contrived to dissipate the general constraint and to impart a portion of her own ease and cheerfulness to the little circle round her she deserves in truth to be painted in the character of rosalind for she can indeed do strange things and seems to have conversed with a magician most profound in his art and yet not damnable she read my heart and soul with that quick intuition with which clever women comprehend all the feelings of a man in love before he can thoroughly decypher them himself she rallied me on my visit to the shooting squire and did it with that sportive delicacy of expression that she neither distressed me nor my tender widow by her raillery though i saw that she perfectly knew what magnet had drawn me to her table as i am naturally sanguine you know i soon felt myself inspirited by the kindness of her reception i thought her eyes said to me i read and applaud your passion for cornelia it is impossible for her at present to afford you any thing like encouragement but i who am her secondself and know all her thoughts will do all that i dare to inspire you with hope this idea gave me new life at the close of dinner a very whimsical little incident happpened which trivial as it may appear i must relate to you at full length because it filled us all with no unpleasant emotion while the servants were setting the wine on the table the eldest of the little sedleys the most lovely and wonderful child of five years that i ever saw came running furiously into the room his beautiful little countenance was illuminated with a brave indignation i never beheld such an image of an infant hero and we soon found that he came on a very heroic errand for as soon as he could collect breath enough to speak he made a very spirited appeal to the alarmed cornelia against the tyranny of nurse who was going to inflict a corporal punishment that he thought very unjust on his little brother i shall never forget the tone and manner of this mavelous boy  my papa said the infant hero told me that when he was gone to heaven i should be the protector of little charles and nobody shall whip him for such a trifle he uttered this with such an enchanting air of infantine magnanimity that i could not help catching him up in my arms and exclaiming heaven bless thee sweet boy thou will be one of the noblestminded men that god ever created i perceived a tear of maternal transport rush to the eye of my cornelia she was greatly affected and was going to quit the room to regulate this petty disturbance but your brother stopped her by insisting on his prerogative as lord paramount of the nursery and confined her under the guard of his wife while he and the little sedley went together to examine and redress the grievance  i defy you to guess in a twelvemonth the high crime and misdemeanour by which the infantculpit had excited the anger of his nurse  apropos of nurse  you whose idea of beauty is always connected with that of fertility and who think a woman never so tempting as when she has a child in her arms you i say would have been frantic at the sight of this beautiful nurse and beautiful indeed you will suppose her to be when i confess that i could not help staring at her in the presence of my adored cornelia  it was a stare of admiration not of licentiousness and to prove to you that it was so when i marry the lovely widow i will send you this admirable creature for your housekeeper you dread i know the galling yoke of hymen and you can never find a more eligible substitute for a wise she is completely in your favorite style of beauty  so rich so luxuriant so smiling  in short a land flowing with milk and honey  but to return to the infant culprit and his inconceivable offense  bless the gay little urchin his crime was nothing more nor less than a kind hint to me to shorten the mourning of his mother whom nature fashioned for joy it seems the lively urchin who is still in petticoats has taken a pleasant aversion to black as he was just equipped to make his appearance in the parlour in a clean white frock and a new broad black sash the rogue contrived to seize a large pair of scissars and made several tremendous gashes in the gloomy decoration of his dress which he could not reconcile to his joyous imagination this had excited the anger and menaces of nurse and the generous interference of his elder brother who exulted not a little when audley returned to us as he soon did with the little rebel in his arms unwhipt and beginning to smile again with cheeks like two crimson roses and with two forgotten tears standing like dewdrops in the middle of each my divine cornelia displayed a great deal of maternal tenderness but with infinite good sense and without a grain of affection she thought herself bound to chide the young delinquent a little for the sake of vindicating the honor and the authority of nurse your brother with much good humor and pleasantry played the advocate for his little namesake and made him very happy by a promise to replace his hateful black ribband by a new one of sky color as there was no mode in which i could venture to make immediate love to my tender widow except by caressing and trying to ingratiate myself with her children you will suppose i was very assiduous in that attempt and i was luckily so successful that i soon became the prime favorite of both never did favorite obtain the influence he wished with less hypocrisy and adulation i was in truth the idolater i professed myself o my divine cornelia such is the magic of thy charms they communicate an inexpressible attraction to all that belongs to thee i protest to heaven i do not believe it possible for me to contemplate any offspring of my own either with admiration or with love superior to what i felt in gazing on thy children you know my dear edmund that i have always had a singular pleasure in the society of such artless little folks it is one of my favorite amusements to observe the free play of unsophisticated nature in their looks their attitudes their expressions the heroism of the elder sedley enchanted me and i was indebted to the younger urchin for a transport still more delightful the sturdy rogue did not relish the mild rebuke of his mother but began to pout like a young achilles and turned his face from her with a sulky grandeur i undertook to negotiate a peace between them and contrived as proxy for the little halfpenitent rebel to imprint a kiss of submissive homage on her imperial hand  imperial i may truly call it as i felt in touching it by this sportive maneuver that every fiber of my frame acknowledged its sovereign sway i trembled at my own presumption though in childish sport and if my divine cornelia had possessed less simplicity of character or less understanding my freedom might have produced a very foolish and very awkward scene but with a grace and delicacy of manner that no words can describe she accepted my homage as the act of her child and seemed not a little obliged to me in her heart for having furnished her with an early pretense for admitting the little halfsullen and halfreconciled rebel to her lap  when the ladies withdrew which they did not without a kind memento from your sister that i must drink tea with them before i proceeded in my journey your brother in a vein of arch hospitality plied me with some excellent wine not forgetting the health of his lovely guest i drank freely in the hope of imbibing courage enough to open my heart to him on the great object of its ambition but the sanctified rogue looked at me with so piercing an eye that he disjointed the exordium of an oration that i was studying for this purpose i believe he comprehended my design and my want of assurance to accomplish it for just as we were summoned to attend the ladies at their tea table he surprised me by the following speech my young and agreeable traveller do not think me an inhospitable barbarian for not asking you to pass the night under my roof come seymour i will be very frank with you i trust you know enough of me to know that i detest every thing like disguise and duplicity i am perfectly aware of your serious passion for the very beautiful and amiable woman now under my protection if the vehemence of love does not blind your own excellent judgment you will perceive on reflection that i could not invite you to remain with us in this early period of her widowhood without failing in the delicate regard that i owe to the character and the feelings of my lovely charge but give me your hand and be assured that so far from being an enemy to your wellplaced affection i only wish to find every possible reason that may enable me in due time to assist and befriend it i caught his extended hand in a transport of gratitude and could not help pressing it to my lips as the hand of a gracious monarch who had just raised an aspiring and anxious subject to the pinnacle of honor and of joy alas my gratitude as you tell me all my passions are inclined to be was much too precipitate hear how the barbarian proceeded i am disposed to regard you seymour as the bosom friend of a brother who is very dear to me you have many of his best qualities but you have also shall i say his defect or his misfortune i see you understand me but too well by the angry fire which is kindling in your countenance but dive into your own heart and ask it fairly if you have any just cause of anger against a man who is kindly showing you what he knows to be the only obstacle in your road to happiness i was abashed i own by the tenderness of this reproof the hasty and indignant speech i had upon my tongue died away without reaching my lips and i sat like a sinner in silent confusion while the triumphant preacher thus continued his discourse you will acquit me of impertinence in hinting thus remotely at this very serious subject when you know that i have some material information to give you concerning it i need not tell you that my relation poor sedley had with all his infirmities a strong understanding a sincere attachment to religion and a perfect sense of the misery which a want of that attachment introduces sooner or later into all the conditions of human life in leaving a beautiful young and rich woman in a world full of various temptations he was too wise to expect or to wish that she should not marry again but his knowledge and his goodness induced him to express to her a peculiar solicitude that she should never marry an irreligious man her resolution on this point is settled and though a libertine might laugh at the idea it has been settled by circumstances of such uncommon solemnity that i question if any human temptations could lead her to renounce or forget it the vows of a widow you may tell me are proverbially frail i have not forgot our common acquaintance the fair matron of ephesus but neither you nor i can look upon cornelia as a creature of that class if indeed it were possible for her to waver my own sentiments and the duty i owe both to the dead and to the living must oblige me to exert all the influence i possess to confirm her in so just and so important a resolution you are very young seymour and it is your misfortune as it was your friend edmunds before you to be acquainted with a set of lively and too agreeable infidels who have led you both i fear very wide of that rock upon which alone it is possible to build human happiness you both i am afraid consider religion either as a mask that hypocrites assume for their interest or at best as a grave bauble for old age to play with i trust the time will come when you will both entertain a much truer idea of it when you will both agree with me in thinking that the very beautiful encomium which tully bestows on literature is still more applicable to religion that it is the friend of every season and situation the guard and ornament of prosperity the refuge of affliction but i ask your pardon the ladies expect you a single glance from the woman you love will have a much better chance of converting you than fifty sermons of mine i will only say detach yourself from your profane associates make yourself religiously worthy of the divine cornelia and i shall have infinite delight in placing her in the arms of a man so accomplished and now having ventured to do it thus metaphorically let me literally show you the way to her by conducting you up stairs without waiting far a reply which in truth i hardly knew how to make he led me to the drawing room there was certainly much of the friend in his address to me but there was also a bitter dash of the parson and the dictator that i was unable to swallow as i followed him up stairs my proud splenetic fancy for a moment subdued even my love i considered cornelia herself in a sarcastic point of view as a new sort of penelope who was to make a trial of her lovers not by a strong bow but by the number of chapters they could read in the bible but the instant i beheld her lovely angelical figure at the teatable every particle of my pride and spleen evaporated i flew all joy and tenderness to her side and while her snowy hand was gracefully presenting a dish of tea to me i was ready to exclaim from the book i have just mentioned entreat me not to leave thee or to return from following after thee for whither thou go i will go and where thou lodgest i will lodge thy people shall be my people and thy god my god  but i repressed my rapture or rather adopted a mode of indulging it which instead of being exceptionable was sure of exciting sympathy and approbation i talked to cornelia of her children i dwelt on the engaging presage of a fine manly character which the little incident after dinner had shown us in her elder boy she listened to me with visible delight i am convinced there is no mode of attacking the heart of a truly amiable widow so effectual as that of making her own child serve you in the character of cupid it has some advantages over the stratagem which venus herself employed in behalf of aeneas when she conveyed the fictitious iulus to the lap of poor dido and the urchin in seeming only to repose on her bosom set it secretly on fire as i think myself without vanity a much honester man than the pious aeneas who like the religious rascals of every age played a thousand dirty tricks in the name of heaven i trust that my dalliance in its end will be very different from his and that i shall turn my widow into a happy wife instead of driving the fair creature to hang herself a fate that the generous dido could not surely deserve even for the extreme folly of having surrendered her charms to a sniveling canting treacherous hypocrite who had the impudence to call himself a hero  but i find to my infinite surprise that i have been writing half the night it is time for me to get to bed and no longer persecute either you or the poor chambermaid and waiter who having exhausted all the little wornout love that they have for each other are yawning and cursing the strange gentleman for writing at such unseasonable hours the conclusion of my days adventure may be told in few words after a very short hours conversation which turned chiefly on the education of children and the force of female friendship i tore myself from the presence of my divine cornelia and the pain that i felt in doing so made me i apprehend very awkward and very ungracious in taking leave of my host every circle of the wheels that conveyed me from his house seemed to raise a new reservoir of spleen in my bosom and before i reached your old acquaintance mine hostess of the garter who by the way is half dead with dramdrinking i had devoted your pious brother to all the devils for a perverse provoking methodist who would persuade a blooming widow full of warm desires not to admit an honest man to her bed till she had heard him repeat his catechism adieu i am as sick and as full of spite as a monkey halfstarved by a miser who pretends to feed and caress it i am however willing to persuade myself that the greater part of my malady arises from my horror of the few ensuing months in which it will be impossible for me to catch another sight of my dear idol you may do much toward my cure if you can fill up this dreadful void in my existence by employing me in your service i have no relish for the remedy that ovid and lucretius great doctors both have prescribed for my disorder  i would rather avoid than go in quest of licentious pleasure i feel indeed at present that friendship alone can be a tolerable substitute for love make my chastity if you please the slave of your incontinence by appointing me the guardian to some pregnant sultana whom you may wish perhaps to have conveyed out of the kingdom that she may enrich your nursery without impoverishing her character you may trust me with more confidence than the grand signor reposes in the chief of his black eunuchs i would not give a straw for the possession of any woman in the world except my unrivalled cornelia and her i must possess or expire in the attempt the season for that momentous experiment is yet very distant and let me repeat that if you can contrive for me to fill up the horrid interim by giving me any friendly commission if you can render me supportable to myself by being any ways useful to you believe me you will be the best of physicians to the untuned and turbulent spirits of  your affectionate etc  letter vi from edmund audley to henry seymour as you seem sufficiently disposed to condemn the waywardness of your own agitated spirit and your splenetic injustice to my brother i will spare you the lecture you deserve on that copious topic matters of a more grievous nature demand our attention you wish me to furnish you with some interesting occupation alas my dear seymour i am but too able to comply with your request i can instantly employ you not in my service indeed but in that of humanity if you have leisure as i know you have spirit enough to embark in a very mournful office that must cost you a great deal of time and may involve you in great trouble and expense but on the other hand it will afford you the delight of atchieving the most charitable exploit and of course raise you high in the estimation of your divine cornelia but why do i trifle in suggesting interested motives to engage a heart like yours in the succor of a lovely afflicted creature whom calamity has visited in a strange land it is a beautiful foreigner quite unknown to you and bowed to the earth by the severest anguish that i ever saw a female boom endure whom i wish you as soon as i can restore her a little more to herself to convey back to the house of an illjudging father which she deserted in a moment of natural anger and illstarred affection i will give you the wretched story as briefly as i can i believe you once saw a young friend of mine whose name was peverell yes i recollect you saw him by your having remarked that he was the most perfect model of manly beauty that you ever beheld alas my dear seymour tears drop upon my paper while i tell you that his fine form which was every way inferior to his soul has been suddenly dashed to pieces by an accident too hideous for description you who know the warmth of my friendship will conceive what i felt on the first horrible surprise of this intelligence the unexpected death of a being so young and so accomplished must be distressing in any state but there are peculiar circumstances that render the anguish of this event inexpressibly severe peverell loved me as you love me and made me the confident or rather the guide and ruler of his most secret concerns in a very neat but small cottage that belongs to me and stands in a most sequestered spot about a mile from my house he had deposited the concealed treasure of his once warm and gallant heart the lovely foreigner i have mentioned she is the child of an old and rich merchant in genoa in whose house my lost friend resided a considerable time the young couple were instructors to each other in their respective languages and soon conceived a vehement and mutual passion poor peverell whose mind had a strong natural biass to every thing honorable thought seriously of marriage and sounded the father the old man took care to make both parties comprehend that he would sooner put the girl into a grave than into the arms of any man who was not a person of rank in his own republic and she in the height of her insulted love very naturally thought that a father deserved to lose his child for a sentiment so proud and inhuman she persuaded the man she adored who was indeed as worthy of her idolatry as a human being could be to decamp suddenly with apparent indignation promising to join him in secret at the first seaport and embark with him for england her character is one of the most singular that i ever met with in her sex from the steady ardour and energy of her mind we might suppose her an ancient roman on her landing here she declined the immediate offer of a private marriage from a generous idea that it might ruin the man she idolized as she knew his dependence on a rich and ambitious uncle all i wish she said at present is to have the delight of feeling myself indebted to you for innocence and freedom had i remained with my father he would have forced me into marriage with a wretch i despise and misery might have led me as it leads many others into all the enormities of guilt i consider myself as your wife in the eye of heaven and i care not for the opinions of earth i have a pride and delight in continuing an absolute dependant on your love because i know your heart sufficiently to be assured that you never abandon a woman for an excess of tenderness and generosity  with these romantic sentiments and with a mavelous and most engaging simplicity of life and manners the lovely giuliana had lived almost two months under my private inspection attended by a little female orphan whom she treats rather as a younger sister than a servant as the girl whose age is about twelve is particularly endeared to her by being the daughter of her deceased nurse and of an unfortunate honest fellow who lost his life in trying to recover some shipwrecked merchandise of her fathers the charms the character and the situation of giuliana soon made me love her as a sister or a child and i urged the poor illfated peverell to try his influence with his uncle sir richard and without confessing the secret of the ladys presence in england to obtain his consent to marry the object of his ardent affection by describing her as she really is the beautiful daughter of an opulent father i had received a letter from my friend who had left us for this purpose to tell me he saw little possibility of succeeding with his uncle and i was writing him a long letter of advice when his faithful valet a most excellent and kindhearted fellow entered my study more like a spectre than a living man this good creature whom i shall love as long as i exist for his fidelity and feeling had rode to tell me as soon as possible what he could not utter when he stood by my side he had only voice enough to say oh sir  my dear master  and sunk in a kind of hysteric fit from the united effects of sorrow emptiness and fatigue when i had a little restored him he related to me the horrid calamity occasioned by an unruly horse and as he described the death of my poor friend with all the strong pathos of genuine affliction our tears flowed apace when the feeling robert suddenly exclaimed to me ah sir we have reason to weep for him for he loved us both but what will that tender soul poor madam giuliana do  o sir i can never tell her he is dead  no i had rather be dashed to pieces myself than tell her o sir you do not know how she loves him you may think she was his mistress perhaps and to be sure i thought so once but it is no such thing they lived as pure as two angels to my certain knowledge dear lady  nobody knows but myself how virtuously she loved my poor master and well she might for to be sure he was the handsomest and the kindest man in the world alas poor lady  left all alone in a strange country but as long as i live she shall never want a servant and i am sure sir you will be a kind friend to her   this heartfelt eulogy and lamentation from an honest domestic proved of infinite service to me for the artless and pathetic manner in which the poor fellow delivered it drew from me a very plentiful shower of tears which rendered me much fitter than i should otherwise have been to engage in the mournful duty that he so feelingly recommended to my attention my first care was to recruit the exhausted frame of the faithful robert himself having ordered him into a warm bed i sat myself on the side of it to be sure of keeping him quiet and to meditate on the best plan of preparing poor giuliana for a calamity which was soon to change her present cheerfulness into the deepest affliction my meditation was soon disturbed by the starts of poor robert who no sooner got a little slumber than it was broken by terrific visions of his masters mangled body or of the distressed giuliana as the latter seemed to dwell most on his spirit i hoped to make the good fellows compassion administer to his own recovery by telling him what indeed i believed that nothing could preserve his mistres from immediate distraction but his summoning up resolution enough to vouch for the truth of every thing that i should find it expedient to say to her to prevent her obtaining any sudden certainty of the horrible event the honest fellow seemed to gain new life from this idea and was very firm in his promises and his intentions he conjured me to let him rise and attend me immediately to the cottage lest in his return to warwickshire he should be too late to attend the funeral of his master whose poor mangled frame was to be deposited as soon as possible in the church where many of his gallant  repose and which stands within the  of sir richards park if poor robert and  been going to execution we could not i eve have suffered more than we did in our  to the residence of giuliana it was still  in the morning and my lovely charge who has a great deal of devotional enthusiasm in her character was singing to her harp one of the most simple sacred airs of marcello this was a cruel incident to me and robert for at e first sound of her pathetic melody half of the strength we had summoned for the occasion deserted us giuliana saw us from her window and flew to let us in with her usual vivacity and delight but her features changed on the first glimpse that she caught of ours what is the matter  where is my dear peverell said the tender giuliana with all the wildness of terrified affection i endeavored with all the firmness i could collect to persuade her that my friend was only confined by a very troublesome but not a very dangerous illness and that knowing our solicitude he had dispatched the faithful robert to give us a clearer account of him than he was able to write she then declared herself resolved to fly to him immediately and attend him through his sickness at any hazard of her reputation of her life she uttered this resolution with such an air of fondness and magnanimity that it overthrew all the promised fortitude of robert and the poor fellow burst into tears o christ exclaimed the quick giuliana fixing her keen eyes upon him my peverell is dead yes i see clearly he is dead by that honest fellows distress i tried to remove her from robert and still to conceal from her the truth but pushing me gently from her with a majesty of affliction that i could not resist the said with the most heartpiercing tone that i ever heard robert you never told me a falsehood in your life i charge you do not deceive me in a point so near my soul as the health of your dear master answer me  o god you need not  i see that he is dead  the solemnity of this appeal utterly overwhelmed the poor servant he burst into a fresh agony of tears and said to her o my dear lady you are an angel and though i resolved to tell you a lie for your own sake i have not power to do it  he then looked at me as if dreading my rebuke but seeing that i also was unable to repress my tears the poor fellow seemed a little consoled for his pardonable weakness and withdrawing from us its fast as he could shut me and the desolate giuliana into her little parlour where we sat silent together for many minutes in a lifeless sorrow that seemed to absorb all the faculties of both  i intended my dear seymour to give you a most minute detail of all the conversation that has passed between me and this most interesting mourner but two things i find will oblige me to contract the limits of this history first i am pressed for time as i wish to bring you speedily to my aid and secondly the scenes i have already gone through for this unfortunate lovely creature have left so strong and recent an impression upon me that i find i cannot relate them to you very minutely without suffering in the relation much more than you would wish me to suffer i will only say therefore that i never beeld affliction which appeared to me so much the affliction of the heart as poor giulianas instead of bursting into those vehement expressions of distress which i expected from the natural vivacity of her character her grief has been calm and concentrated in her bosom she sheds no tears and speaks as if there was hardly life enough in the organs of her voice to permit her to articulate she made but one request to me  it was a very distressing one yet made in such a manner that i would willingly have encountered any difficulties in the world rather than have barbarously thwarted this fond and natural desire of her heart and soul you will probably guess that her desire was to fold once more in her arms the dear breathless idol of her affection and you will think me little less romantic than yourself when i inform you that i have really taken a long journey and actual stolen at midnight into the residence of the dead to gratify this angelic mourner  woe to the marblehearted philosophers who insult real sorrow by their pretended consolation which the bosom of the afflicted is just as able to receive as the lips of the dead are to open for a cordial the only way i believe to triumph over true grief of heart is to indulge it in all the vehemence of its fond desire it was by this method that i have gained an influence over the feeling spirit of the afflicted giuliana which i could not otherwise have acquired but you will want to know some particulars of our secret admission to the tomb i contrived it thus i let the faithful robert return with all the expedition he wished and supplied him with money to purchase for me the private assistance of the sexton this man happened to be my old acquaintance as he had often attended me and my poor departed friend in our shooting parties when sir richard was abroad and his young nephew had the command of his domains the honest fellow lives in a cottage just without the park pale by the side of the high road and picks up some shillings in a year by showing his church in which there are a few curious old monuments being very desirous to keep our expedition as secret as possible we managed so as to reach the cottage of the sexton between eleven and twelve at night the faithful robert had not only met us at the inn we appointed but to show his uncommon solicitude for his afflicted mistress had contrived by his intimacy with the innkeeper to act himself as our postilon this unexpected and touching proof of delicate attention paid to her sorrow by this feeling domestic drew from giuliana the only tear that i observed her to shed in our journey as we found the sexn perfectly prepared to attend us we proed on foot to cross the parkstyle and walked by a triple row of old and venerable trees that lead to the church the night was particularly clear and the moon in her fulest pter never in my life had i taken a nightly walk so affecting giuliana leant on my arm but a sacred horror seemed to have sealed up the lips of both and we glided into the church as silent as two ghosts returning to their graves i had stored my pocket with drops and cordials lest any weakness or panic should oppress the nerves of my dejected and almost lifeless companion but to my surprise she discovered nothing of that chill terror which the time and the scene were so likely to inspire on the contrary animation seemed to rekindle in her frame in proportion as she drew nigh to the dear source of her sorrow i confess my own heart was chilled within me when the sexton who now preceded us with a glass lantern with which the careful robert had supplied him opened the massive and hollowsounding door of an extensive vault that holds two regularly marshalled ranks of the dead in mouldering magnificence in this vault there are two iron ge for a circulation of air and it happened as we entered that the beams of the moon were caed through one of these on a fresh coffin of skycolored velvet and silver ornaments giuliana sprung from me at the sight of it and embraced the coffin with a passionate vehemence she soon found that the lid had been left unfastened for her gratification and having seized the right hand of my poor departed friend she clapped it wildly on her own heart a ghastly smile of mingled agony and delight was now visible in her pale face i began to fear from her looks and gesture that her brain was turned by the impression of the scene and i repented my indulgence especially when she requested with the air of settled madness permission to live in that vault promising not to destroy her own life but to receive a daily supply of bread and water from the poor sexton i never endured a moment to distressing i was obliged to speak to her in a tone of authority and indeed of reproach very foreign to my heart have you forgot said i that peverell was my friend as well as yours and that his spirit now enjoins me to guide and protect you is it not ungrateful to us both to reward me thus for indulging the request of your affliction she fell on her knees at this rebuke and kissed my hand then joining it to the cold hand of her dead lover she kissed them both together and thus took a most affecting oath of implicit obedience to me i hastened to use the power i had gained by leading her out of the vault but was soon distressed by a new petition to return to it for the sake of taking a look of hair from the corse but i insisted on giving this commission to the faithful robert who had attended us i hurried my tender charge as fast as possible into the open air i must reserve all the particulars of our return till i have the comfort of seeing you which i trust will be very soon let me add however that i am now very far from repenting of this mournful expedition i take indeed an honest pride in the part i have acted as i am convinced that nothing could have so well prepared my disconsolate companion for regulating her future conduct as i wish her to do she has still in her countenance and manners the deep traces of intense affliction but i can perceive that her grief is gradually melting into a tender and divine melancholy as long as peverell lived i kept his secret so faithfully that giuliana was unknown even to my sister lucy who was under my roof at the time of the fair strangers arrival at her cottage i had many reasons for this reserve but the death of my friend and the affliction of ths lovely mourner having removed them all i have borrowed the assistance of my sister in consoling giuliana they have contracted a great regard for each other and i had thoughts of going abroad myself with my sister that we might both enjoy the delight of restoring this illfated but amiable fugitive to the house of her father some very important private concerns of our family will render this project impracticable and i know not the man on earth to whom i would willingly resign this delicate office except yourself perhaps it would interfere too much ith your present very anxious pursuit at all events i entreat you to hasten to me and let me at est have the satisfaction of consulting you in person on a business of infinite moment to the afflicted heart of  your affectionate etc  letter vii from henry seymour to edmund audley you and your divine giuliana may command me to the extremity of the earth but why send her back to an old wretch of a father who can never deserve such a child more of this when we meet there is as you justly express it a majesty in her affliction that enforces the homage of my soul and if i can render her any kind of service she may depend on finding a most obedient respectful and affectionate vassal in  your devoted seymour i hope to reach your gate in a few hours after this hasty billet if any circumstances should make it proper for the faithful robert to quit the service of giuliana i beg that he ay live and die in my household at present i am proud of considering myself as his fellow servants adieu    letter viii from miss audley to mrs audley pray quit the apprehensions which you good souls have conceived concerning the morals and the discretion of our dear brother edmund believe me the fine story of his being entangled with an italian mistress is a fiction of that artful toadeater in petticoats who related it so circumstantially and who is you know in my opinion the great nuisance of your neighborhood like most of her mischievous stories it cuts like a sword with a double edge from being a mixture of falsehood and of truth yes you may look as grave as you please upon it but it is even so we have had an italian lady concealed in our cottage but let me add that if one of our family had been tempted to sleep with her it would have been your humble servant lucy and not the innocent edmund not but my sage and systematic bachelor as he styles himself is sometimes a traitor to his own platonic philosophy yet as he comes to me like a culprit to his confessor for spiritual admonition i have hopes of working a very complete reform in his conduct though none of seeing him a married man to confess my own selfinterested nature very frankly as we live on such pleasant terms together and as i think the chance a thousand to one against his being so fortunate in marriage as a certain married brother of mine of your ladyships acquaintance i have no very earnest desire that edmund should cease to be a bachelor yet if he were really enamoured of this fair italian who has frightened you and your good man so dreadfully as i am absolutely in love with her myself and have not alas the power of metamorphosing myself into a husband i should most vehemently wish for edmunds success after this honest declaration if you are not dying with an increased curiosity to know all that i can tell you concerning this bewitching she of italy to borrow a phrase from shakspeare you must certainly be something more than mortal  and now am i ready to quarrel with my foolish self for having talked with such an air of flippant unfeeling levity of a most admirable creature in the utmost grief and anguish perhaps that a human bosom can experience but the truth is your alarm concerning the philosophical edmunds being suddenly ruined by a foreign courtezan hit my fancy so ludicrously that i could not help smiling though with a heart full of sorrow for our lovely giuliana how to tell you who our lovely giuliana is i hardly know except by repeating that she is the most afflicted and the most interesting creature i ever met with but as so brief a description will not i am sure content you i must add that she is the daughter of a rich merchant in italy and was tempted by the most dangerous and insinuating of all modern tempters love to visit england with that wonderfully handsome and unfortunate young friend of edmunds whose calamitous death you mention so feelingly poor peverell had deceived himself with the hope of being able to make his stately proud uncle receive and even love giuliana as his niece the horrid accident we are all lamenting hurried him out of life not only before he had made any successful advances in this chimerical project but before he had taken care as he certainly ought to have done to provide for the subsistence of this lovely stranger in case of such a calamity as it has pleased heaven to inflict yet full as he was of all the sanguine hopes that generous love can inspire added to the natural high spirits of youth in perfect health we cannot wonder that he forgot to reflect on his mortality the consequence however of such forgetfulness might have been cruel indeed to the desolate object of his affection if it had not pleased heaven to raise a guardian i might say a new and better father to the distressed giuliana in our kindhearted edmund the lovely romantic girl who perfectly understood her lovers absolute dependence on his uncle had repeatedly declined a private marriage from a very generous resoluton of not becoming the wife of the man she adored while there was a chance that such a step might involve him in rain she had indeed two events to expect sir richard is neither young nor healthy his consent or his death might have settled our beautiful stranger in the station she deserved to fill there appeared a fair chance that one or other might soon improve her situation and as she had an entire reliance on the truth and generosity of her lover she was contented to abide this chance in what most women would have thought a wretched and humiliating obscurity though under the protection of edmund  i must do my brother the justice to say he kept the secret of these unfortunate lovers with so much fidelity and address that i knew nothing of giuliana though she had resided many weeks in a neighboring cottage till the season of her distress edmund who has indeed behaved to her like a father then made us known to each other in the hope which i have not i trust utterly disappointed that i might assist him in the very difficult task of healing or rather soothing the wounded spirit of this lovely mourner as you are now acquainted with the singularity o her situation you may in some measure conceive the intense grief occasioned by a loss so unexpected which rendered her the most desolate of beings  when she ventured to quit the house of her father whose uling passion is money she made it a point of honor to leave him her jewels and to take from him nothing of value except indeed herself  a treasure that he seems never to have estimated as he ought as to her departed lover his heart was much richer than his purse his allowance from the sparing sir richard never equalled his expenses and his love being of too noble a kind to show itself in costly trifles he had made his mistress no such presents as might on a sudden exigence be converted into gold thus it my brother had not stood like a good angel by her side the young the beautiful the chaste and lately opulent giuliana might have been reduced with her little abigail a sweet orphan girl of twelve years either to beg her way home to an enraged father or to seek subsistence among strangers by some humiliating occupation the bare idea of such a lovely creature falling suddenly into such penury and wretchedness makes my heart shudder whenever it recurs to my mind but our tender giuliana never felt her misfortune in this hideous point of view she felt only the loss of him by the light of whose countenance alone she appeared to exist and she felt it so intensely that edmund assures me it was the passionate desire of her soul to be shut up from the world and end her existence in the vault that holds the shattered frame of her illfated lover i will tell you one day or other all that our dear edmund has done to indulge the wildness of her affliction at present i must only say that no don quixote ever exerted more generous spirit to restore a distressed fairone to her living lord than our brother has done to gratify the intense grief of this true and engaging mourner for the gallant youth she has lost his success has been equal to his good intention i never saw gratitude expressed by any human being in a manner so touching as giulianas in expressing hers to us both it is not by saying she is obliged to us but by showing in a thousand undescribable ways that her gratitude i by no means inferior to her excessive affliction by letting us see that she makes her poor broken and bleeding heart submit itself entirely to the guidance of my brother and that he has gained an influence like that of heaven over her actions and even her will i have really had a great though melancholy delight in contemplating the very singular regard which compassion on his part and sorrow and gratitude on hers have produced between them i never behold any human attachment more affecting and edmund you know has imparted to me his habit of moralizing on our passions and affections my contemplations i confess are very apt to be infected with feminine weakness and to tell you an honest truth i could not behold the influence of edmund and giuliana on each other without finding an idea of their union perpetually obtruding itself on my reluctant mind yet as i own the idea was very insuitable to the time and circumstances i never mentioned it to either and i will pawn my life that it never occurred either to the one or the other edmund is so very anxious to have this tender unhappy fugitive safely restored and reconciled to her father that we had thoughts of taking a trip to italy for the satisfaction of escorting her home how charming would this have been to have united humanity and pleasure so delightfully but alas the provoking legal business which we now find in such a train as to require our presence in england for some months is an insuperable bar to this captivating project edmund however has been so fortunate as to find a charitable proxy to his hearts content giuliana and her little attendant are set forth this morning on their return to italy under the guidance and protection of his friend seymour who after passing a few days here has undertaken in the most delicate and generous manner not only to convey the two forlorn foreigners to their own country but to accomplish a reconcilement between giuliana and her father exactly in the way that my brother had devised  so you really think that your sweet friend cornelia has conceived without knowing it a real passion for seymour i am not at all surprised at it especially after the diverting anecdotes you tell me of the fondness which her children have conceived for this engaging mortal i own if i were a widow myself nothing would win me so soon as the perceiving a man beloved by my children and of course very fond of them i believe seymour is perfectly sincere in his present extreme passion for the widow but were i in her case i should tremble for the issue of the expedition in which he has so gallantly embarked to travel so far by land and by sea with a most beautiful creature in the most interesting of all possible situations  well i will only say if he continues steady in his attachment to your cornelia he is a phoenix of a lover and deserves to be cherished accordingly  as our dear edmund is apt you know to be very profound in his projects of benevolence he has a double view in committing giuliana to the care of his friend but to explain this i must tell you a circumstance in which your good husband will triumph not a little as it affords a striking confirmation of his favorite maxims concerning the use and efficacy of devotion in every period of life pray desire him therefore to take notice that this piece of information is addressed particularly to himself and he i am sure will not suppose me mistaken when i tell him that although edmunds very tender and parental attention to the desolate giuliana had great influence in soothing her sorrow yet in truth it is religion alone that has enabled her wounded spirit to surmount the calamity which appeared to crush it from all the particulars of her story i am convinced that she felt for the unhappy peverell as pure and as strong a passion as the female bosom is capable of feeling the devotional turn of her mind has converted her love into literal und surely happy and pardonable adoration she considers this dear object not as hurried out of life to leave her without a guardian in the thorny and dangerous paths of the world but as transported to heaven to secure for her and to share with her everlasting felicity she thinks herself not only awakened and directed by this angelic guide to save her own soul but to attempt and accomplish the salvation of her father she is persuaded and perhaps with some truth that both have been deficient in their respective duties from being equally blinded by two different deceivers interest and love your husband would be marvellously delighted by her pathetic eloquence on this devout subject indeed i hardly think it possible for the most hardened infidel to hear her without tears and without paying the lovely preacher at least such a compliment as agrippa paid to paul it is on the sweet magic of this heavenly sorrow that our good edmund hs built some very friendly hopes in behalf of seymour he is willing to believe that a long attendance on this engaging mourner this divine enthusiast may cure that too light though agreeable and generous young man of the alarming irreligious levity which is the only blemish in his attractive character for my own part i must say though i think the observation does not become a spinster i fear there is more benevolence than probability in edmunds idea i am afraid the expedition may rather lead this too lively creature into a profane passion for the beauty before him than into a religious attachment to an absent fair i must however do him the justice to say that he shows the most delicate respect to the grief of giuliana but his esteem for her devotion i can guess by one of his sprightly remarks to me concerning her present views the rogue said he did not apprehend that any piety was strong enough to cure a young woman of love or an old man of avarice i should add however that after opposing giulianas return to the old miser to use his own words he became an absolute convert to the reasoning of my brother and appeared to sympathise with him most cordially in his wish of reconciling the dear lovely devout girl and her outrageous father  i am charged by seymour to solicit both you and your cornelia to honor him with some commissions abroad and i have promised to convey to him your respective commands as your friend has so sweet a voice i think you cannot do better than desire a complete collection of all the airs sung by our dear giuliana my brother says she has an infinite variety of songs unknown in our country and wonderfully sweet besides their intrinsic merit as musical compositions they will have an additional charm to all of us in recalling the lovely image of giuliana to our minds the attractions of her character are such that even you and cornelia who have never beheld her beauty will yet have a pleasure in thinking of her when edmund and i have had sufficient opportunities to tell you a thousand little interesting anecdotes relating to her short residence in our country  at present i must add but a few lines to this enormous packet for which i shall hope to be as amply repaid by a full history of all the new discoveries that you may have made in the heart of cornelia pray send if you dare a few animating words for me to dispatch to the generous guardian of giuliana on his travels there is some virtue in this petition for it may keep him constant to his present chaste passion to give him some prospect of future success i am ready to laugh at myself in perceiving what a lively interest i who have renounced love on my own account am still ready to take in the loves of my acquaintance i am i think like an unlucky gamester who having narrowly escaped the utter wreck of his fortune and having solemnly  never to touch a card again yet loiters round the tables and has an odd pleasure in peepng into every and that he can catch a sight of well heaven bless all the anxious adventures say i in this ound me of chance that i have declined for ever you my dear harriot are like a lucky mortal at commerce who has triumphantly cried content perfectly secure that no one can exhibit a richer hand the contemplative edmund says that in every numerous family there should be one maiden aunt and one bachelor uncle to buy toys for the children and to lecture the parents we are both steady in our purpose to fill these humble but useful and quiet departments of life and to remain as the great philosopher whom i have just named expresses it in a wise and armed neutrality between the joys and afflictions that are continually treading on the heels of each other both in love and wedlock  adieu  letter ix mrs audley in answer to the preceding you are a charming good creature my dear lucy to relieve us so soon and so effectually from our apprehensions you have made us laugh at our own moral panic as i may call it concerning the continence of edmund you have made us weep at the very bitter affliction of your interesting giuliana and you have made us laugh again by the pleasantry of your sage reflections upon single blessedness you may talk as you please of your wise intentions but i hope destiny has more benevolence to man than to have devoted such a delightful creature as my dear correspondent to a life of celibacy you have indeed had a narrow escape after much agitation of the heart from matrimonial misery with a partner who showed himself in a fortunate though painful moment unworthy of the blessing that in the blindness of our deluded affection we all wished him to possess you felt and you supported the disappointment in a manner that has rendered you inexpressibly dear to all who have the happiness of your friendship and i trust it will be your lot to receive a richer reward in the love of some happier man as perfectly deserving of you as the wretch i allude to was unworthy deuce take the artful fellow i hate to think of him yet the remembrance of all his base deceptions will often creep over my mind like a chilling mist with a damp easterly wind there is certainly much more true heroism in your soul my dear lucy than in mine though my good man often pays me compliments on my fortitude i could not have passed through such scenes as you have had to sustain with half your spirit or half your good sense i rejoice to find that you still retain the natural tender gaiety of your heart and form to yourself an agreeable amusement in contemplating the affections of your acquaintance  i am most willing to impart to you the intelligence you request yes yes i have made discoveries in the bosom of our cornelia do not the philosophers talk of little spots in the moon that they affirm to be burning volcanos i can perceive without the aid of any mavelous glasses from that most obliging and polite man of deep science mr herschell a spot of this flaming nature in that chaste luminary the heart of our lovely widow heavens what a crimson cheek would she have were she to peep over my shoulder and peruse this saucy sentence but it is even so love is like murder not to be concealed however obstinately it may be denied the dear dainty hypocrite is angry with me when i tell her so yet i could give you a thousand little unquestionable evidences in support of my charge but i have only time to tell you one that struck me yesterday a gentleman happened to dine with us who has passed the greater part of his life abroad cornelia engaged him in a conversation apart and i accidentally discovered that genoa had been a capital subject in their discourse she had enquired if english travelers had ever been tempted to marry there by the fair natives of that opulent city when i jestingly alluded to this enquiry which she did not suppose me to know she blushed in such a violent degree that as we were alone i could not help seizing her hand and exclaiming in a very odd sort of emotion between a laugh and a cry well my dear you shall have him let him be jew or gentile this led us into much serious conversation in which with more frankness than she had ever shown upon this subject before she confessed  here lucy i see you smile in full and rogueish expectation of perusing the word love that indeed would have been a confession worth listening to but not so fast my dear girl we are not yet arrived at that stage of the disorder no we confessed only that of all the single men in the world this lively and generous traveller mr seymour is the most agreeable in figure in manners in conversation but as to love no positively seriously and by all the unquestionable asseverations that ever passed the chaste lips of widowhood we have not the slightest spark of that fiery passion in our frame mr seymour may pass his whole life in italy and we should feel no farther solicitude concerning him than what every amiable mind must feel for the welfare of an accomplished young man who engaged so readily in a rare and noble act of humanity and so my dear lucy so we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us she means all that she says for her honest lips have not the power of uttering even an equivocation if her mind was capable of conspiring with her heart to meditate disguise she believes herself perfectly from the soft infection but if i know any thing of love or human nature she is actually fallen into the malady of poor d do and as virgil and dryden y of that hapless queen she seeds within her veins a flame unseen  oh pray order for us the collection of giulianas songs love is an admirable musicmaster do not fail to send us the earliest tidings you receive of the interesting travelers you may tell symour from me that if he will but grow half as devout as he is agreeable there is nothing honorable which he may not hope from the most scrupulous of our sex i have still a thousand things to say to you but i must reserve them till i write again the youngest of my dear little chits has been ailing these two days and i must throw aside my pen to take the poor little invalid in my arms  ah lucy the taxes on matrimonial happiness run very high adieu  letter x seymour to edmund audley here we are safe at dover and after writing the enclosed extempore translation of what the grateful giuliana dictated to me in her own language i have hardly time to add a word more as they are hurrying us on board the packet lest we lose our passage yet i will say i am inexpressily obliged to you for the very high though mournful delight i receive in executing the office with which you have honored me i now indeed subscribe to your maxim that the melancholy pleasures are far superior to the gay ones what a heavenly creature is this giuliana how willingly would i expire by any death to receive from my adored cornelia such genuine tenderness as peverell receives from this angelic mourner how nonsensical how frantic would this idea appear to beings who never were in love and have no feelings for the delicious extravagance of that sublime passion yet it reigns at this moment in full force over my heart and soul but here is a second summons from the captain of the packet so farewell  letter xi giuliana to edmund and lucy audley though i borrow the hand and the language of my generous conductor it is with my own poor and broken but not ungrateful heart that i send these hasty thanks and tenderest remembrances to you both dear friends dearest and kindest of all living natives of this dear land that i am going to quit for ever though it holds in its bosom the lost treasure of my soul do not think that your giuliana whom you have so benignly labored to rescue from despair and distraction begins to murmur again in wicked forgetfulness either of your most friendly admonitions or of those sacred suggestions inspired into her wounded bosom by that alma felice che fovente torna a consolar le mie notti dolenti con gli occh sui che morte non ha spenti petrarch  that blessed soul that often returns to soothe my nights of sorrow with his eyes that death has not extinguished no my dear friends let me assure you since i know it will please your benevolent hearts that i have rather gned than lost both composure and fortitude of mind and my bodily health is far better than i thught it could possibly be on such an embarkation as this i will confess to you that the first sight of the sea which i am to repass affected my whole frame in a manner that no words can express it brings me with such new force the dear image of him who led me across it to your shore erde a li occhi a g cchi i proprio obbietto serzl qual imperetto  oprar el ino viver e mote petrarch  it restores to my eyes and to my ears their proper object without which their functions are imperfect and my life is death pardon me dearest friends for perpetually using the words of a tender and heavenly poet of my country who though his loss and calamity was not equal to mine has powerfully expressed the feelings of my affliction it seems to me as if my peverell had a presentiment of what was to befall me when he delighted in making me recite to him the most pathetic compositions of our favorite petrarch it seems as if he foresaw that the melancholy verses of that exquisite poet would one day be a sort of soothing magic to the heart on which he so diligently imprinted them such indeed they are to me now and especially all the many heavenly passages that so forcibly represent to me  il mio fido e caro duce che mi condusse al mondo or mi conduce per miglier via a vita senza affanni   my faithful and dear guide who once conducted me in this world and now conducts me by a better road to a life without pain but my devout attachment to this dear celestial gde of my soul must not make me ungratefully t to thank you for the assistance i receive from that friendly and generous conductor to whose care you have so kindly recommended me and who is so good as to make my poor thoughts intelligible to you he is so indulgent to my srrow and shows so much sympathy in it that i almost persuade myself he is a brother of my dear peverell ah my heart tells me that every gentle spirit of your beloved country must be considered by me as his brother if any such should happen to be overtaken by calamity in the land where i must pass the residue of my mournful life what satisfaction should i have in administering to their distress and thus proving myself ever mindful of those infinite and inexpressible obligations which my dear english father edmund and his angelic sister have heaped on your poor devoted giuliana  dear england and dearest of friends adieu i kiss your charitable hands with the most impassioned gratitude and reverence  encor adio  thus far giuliana  i cannot close this paper as her secretary without adding in this spare corner of it a short ejaculation imploring the genius of this divine woman and the spirit of petrarch to forgive me for all the injustice i have done to their rich delicate harmonious language by the poverty and roughness of my rapid extempore translation  seymour  letter xii seymour to edmund audley calais after a smooth but rather a slow passage we are at length in france thank heaven you want not any description of french people or french buildings if you did i fear the accounts you would gain from me would be very unsatisfactory i can see and hear nothing but my marvellously interesting fellowtraveller what a divine creature she is how admirable in her form and faculties how exquisite in her sensations what efforts of heart and soul has it cost her to tear herself from the land that holds her buried lover i can never forget her looks and gesture as she quitted our coast the last thing she did on shore was to stoop and pick up a pebble which she kissed devoutly and then pressed into her bosom a million of words could not have expressed so much as she did by this little gesture i believe i should have thought it fantastic in another woman but in giuliana it appeared simple graceful and affecting in the highest degree what a rich fund of singular and entirely new delights have you afforded me my dear edmund by this commission had a prophet told me two years ago that i should at this time be traveling with a young beauty not connected with any living mortal that i should hear day after day the softest language from the most lovely lips that i should have every opportunity for the most tender familiarities and yet that i should sit by the side of this fair creature without thinking that she had such a thing as a lip belonging to her without feeling a single intimation from all the warm and wanton blood in my veins that i had a daughter of eve within the reach of my embrace had a prophet i say told me this i should have laughed at him for a lying oracle and have informed him that his prediction was not very consistent with general nature and still less so with my constitution yet this is truly the case giuliana seems to have realized the idea in a charming song of parnells to have been a woman to peverell alone and to be an angel to all the rest of mankind i may in truth apply to her the expression of her darling petrarch and say that her eyes seem to purify the air and to banish every evil thought from her presence you know i have long been fond of the italian language and i thought myself an intelligent admirer of petrarch that insipid and wearisome sonneteer in the estimation of ordinary readers that most exquisite and enchanting of all poets to every refined spirit under the immediate influence of sorrow or of love but though a tolerable proficient in his language i really never felt the magic of petrarch till i heard him recited by giuliana and for this very high delight i am partly indebted to accident in drawing out her purse at canterbury to bestow her charity on a venerable old mendicant giuliana let fall a most elegant diminutive copy of this celebrated poet this as she herself informed me had been the constant pocketcompanion of her dear peverell the book as if in sympathy with its master had even received a wound from the horrid accident which occasioned his death and his servant the faithful robert thinking very justly that his tenderhearted mistress would prize it as a sacred invaluable relic had begged preserved and presented it to her i was highly pleased with this little anecdote and particularly happy to catch a subject for conversation that i knew to be in harmony with the feelings of my afflicted companion i made petrarch therefore the main topic of our discourse i feigned myself puzzled by some passages for the pleasure of leading giuliana to amuse herself by a kind explanation of them heavens if the soul of the poet was conscious of our conference concerning him what delight must he have received from the eloquent praise of his lovely commentator when she found i had some relish for her darling author she began to indulge herself in various quotations so pathetically apposite to her own condition and delivered with such perfect eloquence that i seemed never to have been acquainted either with true poetry or true elocution till that moment i should fill a volume were i to enumerate and give you a full account of all these indeed you have a little specimen but without her voice and with my translation a most imperfect specimen of them in her letter from dover i must however tell you one of her quotations which struck me most forcibly but let me first mention the occasion that produced it you know i join with you in detesting that cruel and absurd maxim of endeavoring to console extreme sorrow by leading it from its object grief is a noble imperious passion that ought not to be thwarted but to be flattered and indulged on these principles instead of avoiding the name of peverell i have frequently introduced it and as we were within a few miles of dover in speaking of the personal attractions of laura i extolled in the warmest terms that rare portion of masculine grace and comeliness which that gallant young man was universally allowed to possess i thought i saw in the features of giuliana that her impassioned heart swelled with a delightful though melancholy pride in hearing this honest praise of its idol and in a moment she exclaimed discolorato hai morte il piu vel volto che may si vide e i piu begli occhi spenti spirto piu acceso di virtuti ardenti del piu leggiadro e piu vel nodo hai sciolto in un momento ogni mio ven mihai tolto   oh death thou have discolored the most beautiful countenance and extinguished the brightest eyes thou have loosed from the most graceful of mortal bonds a spirit most animated by every ardent virtue in a moment thou have robbed me of all my treasure would to heaven i were a poet that i might give you a juster idea of these enchanting numbers yet even then i could not convey to you the inimitable gesture and heartsearching tone of giuliana these were so exquisitely pathetic n this occasion that i was never half so much affected by the deepest tragedy as by her recitation of these few verses my tears i believe would have continued flowing till we entered dover had not my affection been called to a little auditor who felt the pathos of this passage still more intensely than i did you will immediately see this could be no other than the poor faithful giannina whom you seated on the stool at our feet i soon perceived her little rosy face was grown as pale as death itself and i verily believe the girl would have fainted or fallen into convulsions if i had not jumped from the chaise and carried her in my arms for a few paces in the cool air giuliana who is you know all tenderness to this little orphan soon completed her recovery by the sweetness of her maternal solicitude for the affectionate sufferer but let me return to petrarch as we are such idolaters of the poet we have agreed to visit vaucluse on our journey and i shall not write to you again till we have paid our devotions there i conjure you and lucy to sit down and begin learning italian together you know not what delight you have lost by not being able to converse with our lovely friend in her own sweet languge thank heaven my cornelia both speaks and sings it my cornelia do i say alas if she is destined not to be so do you know that giuliana who has i fancy received some hints from lucy begins to preach to me like an angel as she is on my impetuous character and the danger of the passions i am impetuous i confess yet not unreasonable in my wishes oh heaven let me be but as ardently beloved by cornelia as peverell still is by giuliana and i will ask no more adieu my engaging fellowtraveller entreated me to say every thing that is kind for her while i have been writing she and giannina have been trying to sleep off the unpleasant effects of their seasickness they are now much restored once more adieu and let me repeat my request and consign you to your italian grammar that you may read the future letters of giuliana with full pleasure she will write to you she says as long as she exists and if you do not acquire her language you may oblige her perhaps hereafter to have her thoughts and words mangled by some translator still worse than your affectionate etc  letter xiii from the same to the same lions as i knew i should find opportunities of sending our kind remembrances to you by your intimate friend and most punctual correspondent at paris i intended not to write to you again till we had reached avignon and visited vaucluse the only object in our road that i thought likely to interest the curiosity and afford any thing like amusement to my lovely grief devoted companion but we have unexpectly met with some adventures in our way that not only drove petrarch and vaucluse from her mind but almost made her forget even peverell himself in a word my dear edmund but do not be alarmed for the danger is all over i have been at the point of death i had reason indeed to call giuliana an angel for i must have expired had not this divine creature watched over me with an attention as indefatigable and incessant as ever was paid by a fond mother to her sick infant we have now been eleven days in this commodious and charitable city i ought i am sure to bestow upon it that honorable epithet as i have received from its generous inhabitants to whom even my name was unknown various presents of such articles as they supposed might be of use and comfort to a stranger whom sickness had overtaken on his travels my disorder i confess has been the natural effect of my own imprudence for at moulines i did a very foolish thing unknown to giuliana and trusting too much to a strong constitution i contracted a villainous cold and fever by passing the whole night in the open air to gratify a nonsensical whim that i will explain to you hereafter by slighting my complaint at first i made it miserably serious on my arrival here i was obliged to keep my bed and during the first seven days giuliana and her good little silent shadow giannina were constantly in my chamber day and night they have now god bless them restored me to such a degree that we are to set forward again tomorrow and in a mode of traveling that instead of wearying me with the fatigue of a journey will rather restore me by the most easy pleasant and refreshing exercise for we are to descend the rhone in a large batteau in which there is a cabin it will take our carriage on board and we are to stop in this agreeable voyage for the purposes of dining and sleeping at the different towns that embellish the banks of the river thus they tell us we shall be smoothly and gaily wafted to avignon and in truth though my fever is entirely gone i am not yet fit for any sort of rapid or rough motion here is my best physician nurse and governess giuliana looking at her submissive and grateful patient with her angelic black eyes and commanding me to resign my pen first because my head is not very fit to guide it any longer and secondly because she is determined she says to add herself an english postscript to this epistle she shall not however take the paper from me till i have told you that instead of lamenting i really bless my illness because it has in its termination done more essential service to the wounded spirit of my lovely friend than my broken health could possibly have rendered her my recovery seems indeed to have given her new existence o benevolence i was not before insensible to thy beauty or thy power but i knew not till now thy healing efficacy over a heart however bruised and torn that is still able to feel thee in all thy purest excess giuliana in saving and securing to me that life which was on the point of its departure from this suffering frame has in great measure dispelled the oppressive cloud which hung so heavy on her celestial mind though it is a cordial to me to praise her to you as i ought she will not allow me to scribble a syllable more so farewell be not at all alarmed for me and depend on my writing again very soon  p s by giuliana i must invite you to rejoice with me dearest friends for i did not think my poor heart could ever feel again upon earth a joy of so much sincerity and spirit like what i feel in the safety of this generous soul my kind conductor who has been sick indeed by the assistance of the good god i have made him to live when i thought he must die now praised be heaven all the danger is over these are joyful english words from the pen of your giuliana praying a most happy course to your honorable lives i kiss your dear hands my beloved father edmund and sister lucy adio    letter xiv from miss audley to mrs audley with the preceding enclosed thank you my dear harriot for the very amusing peep you have given me into to the bosom of our cornelia you have in a most lively manner presented her whole heart to my eyes and methinks such a view of a heart in love is like viewing a little lump of cheese through a microscope i see all the poor cornelias doubts fears hopes wishes caprices arguments surmises fantasies etc etc etc all huddled and hurried together in perpetual rotation like a legion of mites and forming as it were the very substance of her heart i fancy all her honest and delicate hypocrisy though it deceives herself will never lead you to doubt on the real state of her affection but if you wish to put the point to still farther proof i shall enable you to do so for i enclose what i think an infallible touchstone for that purpose you have only to read to her the letter from seymour which you will find in this taking care however to omit a parenthesis of comfort just before you come to the words i have been at the point of death if she is in truth so deeply in love with the engaging creature as we have reason to conjecture you will see her turn as pale as i did in a moment you well remember when you and i were first informed that a certain plausible deceiver who had just boasted to us of his prosperous voyage was utterly undone i most heartily hope that the issue of your cornelias love may be more happy than mine  it may be more happy and yet not so tranquil for my own part i now rest on the same maxim of a reasonable poet aim not at joy but rest content with ease  let me however in disclaiming joy declare that i mean only the joys of love for as to those of friendship which i am persuaded are infinitely the more valuable few mortals possess them in more abundance and none can feel them in a higher degree than i do particularly when i reflect my dear harriot on all your kindness toward me and assure you with a love passing the love of man that i am  your affectionate etc p s edmund is well but not a little anxious concerning the health of his friend for my part i am inclined to think this illness is providential and only destined to prevent his being licentiously enamoured of his lovely companion of which i confess i had terrible apprehensions what a charming creature she is i was infinitely more affected by her little postscript of odd english than by all seymours account of his malady farewell pray tell me very soon how my touchstone operates on the tender widow methinks i am like an old chemist who having burnt his fingers impaired his health and then destroyed all his books in dudgeon takes a sort of halfmalicious and halfgoodnatured pleasure in observing a chemical novice who carelessly sports with the most subtle corrosive before he is perfectly and painfully apprized of its extreme power  i intended you a larger packet but as the contents of this are very interesting and i have an opportunity of dispatching them immediately by a private conveyance i seize it with great eagerness so once more farewell    letter xv mrs audley in answer to the preceding you are a skilful chemist indeed my dear lucy  an absolute conjuror but pray send us no more of your corrosive touchstones my dear or when you do be so kind as to give me at the same time a lesson of caution on the use of them  turn pale indeed do you call this turning pale to be half frightened out of sense and existence ah poor cornelia verily thou art infected but let me recover from my sympathy in her panic and make a full confession to you my dear full sister in this little piece of inquisitorial iniquity how very wickedly i managed it your packet traveling by a private hand found me alone in the morning cornelia had left me to write letters in her own room having perused both yours and seymours i was seized with a passionate desire to make the most of your touchstone i believe my dear all women have a little white malice in their minds on such occasions i instantly sealed the packet again very neatly and told my own maid to bring it to me as just arrived when she found that cornelia and i were sat down as usual to work together in the favorite little dressing room this critical time soon arrived and while we were discoursing on the travelers a very frequent topic with us your kind packet was put again into my hand before i broke the seal i observed no small degree of solicitude in the countenance of my companion i thought her eyes sparkled with pleasure on the sight of seymours hand she entreated me to read his letter aloud i obeyed your direction and left out the parenthesis that speaks of his recovery and in slowly pronouncing the words at the point of death i fixed a searching eye on the features of my friend describe them to you i cannot  no language can do justice to their expression i must therefore content myself with telling you my own varied sensations of the moment when i caught the first glimpse of her face as i had my own treacherous trick very strongly in my head i was on the point of laughing at the appearance of its success but the pallid hue of affectionate terror and i may say agony growing every instant more alarming in the countenance of cornelia who sat before me with the open but speechless lips of anxiety and expectation my heart smote me and rendered me unable to execute all the cruel design that i had formed against her which was to let her remain for some hours in an absolute persuasion of seymours being still in great danger this barbarity i could not support i read the reviving parenthesis but without an avowal that i ought to have read it before she was a little comforted but her sufferings were still severe enough to excite my compassion she perceived that i pitied her and it both softened and opened her heart toward me for on my saying with an halfsmile ah my dear cornelia can you still say and think that you do not love seymour she burst into a flood of tears and hiding her lovely face in my bosom she said in a heartpiercing murmur i do my dearest friend i do love him in my soul but it is a folly and a crime my dear harriot that you must not encourage but help me to cure  you my dear lucy who know what a friend i am to all honest love will readily guess the part i now took in our conversation i said every thing that the most friendly sympathy could suggest to soothe and to fortify her overscrupulous and trembling heart i said what i really think that her affection instead of being either foolish or criminal is the fair offspring not only of nature but of propriety and justice the very delicate and respectful manner in which seymour had sought her esteem during the life of the poor old querulous invalid whom it was impossible for her to love the trembling awe and the fond anxiety with which he ventured to force himself into her presence in this house and all his behavior here furnished me with weighty arguments in his favor and i pleaded his cause i believe with all the warmth of a sister for i almost feel that i love him with a sisterly affection myself the poor fellow seemed to derive so much comfort from my little civility to him in his short visit here when my good man and cornelia were both inclined to look rather blank upon him that he convinced me of the truth and force of his passion by the excess of his timidity and embarrassment for in the first hour or two be seemed as it were to cling to me to give him courage as a child does in first entering a dark room with its nurse as the rogue does not want either grace or decent confidence in his general manners his extreme sensibility on this occasion inclined me very much to befriend him i did so when he was here i have now done so in his absence and if it should really prove a misfortune to cornelia to love him as the dear weeping trembler told me it certainly must heaven forgive me for the sin i have incurred in fanning the flame of her bosom not that i think seymour much indebted to the abilities or the zeal of his advocate for the sway he has gained over this little submissive though murmuring heart we are talking of i said indeed a good deal in his praise but what of that ad not the most eloquent of all eulogists spoke before me  had not love informed her that in ae in figure in fortune and in mutual regard seymour and cornelia are a couple uncommonly wellpaired they are indeed so perfectly matched in these essential points that it is hardly possible to see them together without wishing them united  aye but my sweet harriot says the trembling conscientious cornelia think of that tremendous article religion remember the dying advice of my kind and provident sedley no let me die by a malady more painful and more lingering than his rather than act in opposition to so just so benevolent a counselor my dear cornelia i admire your virtuous spirit  i am charmed with your resolution but do not disquiet your gentle heart with these imaginary terrors there may be no such obstacle as you suppose in your way to happiness  nay my good harriot why would you wish to flatter and delude me did not you yourself the other day in speaking of seymour allude to the universal opinion of his being an infidel you spoke indeed in jest  a barbarous jest  but you did not know how deeply you wounded this very foolish heart now i have laid open to you all its aching fibers pray my dear harriot drop a little oil upon them and do not i conjure you do not administer to me any of those dangerous medicines which under the pretense of healing a wound only inflame and render it incurable  indeed i must not think of seymour  no i never will think of him i hope he will remain in italy  i wish he may fall in love with giuliana  it is very likely here a deep sigh which made me exclaim oh you abominable lovely hypocrite you have not any such wish in your heart and if you ever forced yourself to feel it for a moment and heard of its being accomplished it would still make you halffrantic come come my dear cornelia there is really no occasion for any of these desperate insupportable wishes wish him a good godly husband to yourself and try to make him so who my dear could mould the rough arrogant mind of man better than such a gentle angel as yourself when inspired by the best motives both of heaven and earth true piety and chaste affection do we not read in history that most of the gothic sovereigns in europe were converted to christianity by their wives after all my dear though we have allowed ourselves to talk freely of seymours wanting devotion yet surely he is not more deficient in that point than the general herd of young men who have been bred to his rank and fortune they are all so engrossed by pleasure or ambition that few can find time either to think or to hear of god indeed i believe the generality of men in all stations are little acquainted with devotional ideas till toward the middle or rather the latter stage of their life when being settled in a domestic circle and seeing a new generation rise to succeed in their departments they find it high time to reflect on a better world  you know my dear cornelia it was my singular good fortune to fall into the arms of a man whose amiable mind imbibed very early a deep sense of religion but as he has told me himself he was indebted for this blessing to some remarkable incidents that happened to him in his youth much more than to any instruction religious as he is no man can be more indulgent to those who differ from himself though his sense of the beneficial influence which religion has had and still has on his own happiness makes him wish most cordiaally to see it more prevalent his sentiments and discourse on the levity of others are never violent or intrusive i know he most sincerely admires all the generous and all the agreeable qualities in seymour and i will venture to say that no event in the world would give him more pleasure than one which he thinks by no means improbable and which i confess myself inclined to reckon in the class of certainties i mean the event of our seeing the engaging seymour every thing we can wish him or to use the devout and gallant language of chivalry most perfect in his homage both to god and his fairone  twas thus my dear lucy that i ran on in my affectionate harangue to comfort and enliven the dear troubled cornelia i had the satisfaction of seeing her sweet countenance more and more ferene as i proceeded till at last her face growing bright as the face of an angel she pressed my hand and exclaimed in a transport from her favorite tragedy of zara were he but christian what could man be more  she uttered this line with such an air of fond and devout passion and as she spoke the possibility or rather the hope of being holily united to the only man she has ever loved gave such a rich and tender glow to her lovely features that i never saw any woman look so gloriously beautiful to use a strong expression of our admired lady wortley as my dear comforted cornelia looked in that moment i believe i remained gazing at her in mute delight for a minute as the pleasant traveller i have just mentioned gazed on the fair fatima at adrianople though the turkish lady i grant was a more dazzling figure from the splendid novelty of her dress i am persuaded she was not equal in beauty to my incomparable friend for in the first place i can never think that black eyes can equal the delicious tenderness of blue secondly the monotony of turkish love can hardly permit the face of a sultana to express that sweet and rich combination of intelligence sentiment and passion which gave such inexpressible charms to the countenance of cornelia at the instant i am talking of but this little digression on beauty of which you know i am a great idolater has detained me too much i must hasten to tell you that we remained not long on those transporting heights to which our spirits were suddenly carried cornelia soon fell from the pinnacle of hope and i gently descended from that of admiration our conference took a more sober turn and closed with a discreet resolution not to enter into any warm arguments either for or against the object of our debate but to leave things as they now are to those two great settlers of human doubts and perplexities time and chance in the mean time you will readily believe that our eagerness to be favored with all the dispatches you receive from the travelers is not in a way to be diminished exclusive indeed of the interest cornelia takes in his welfare i am heartily concerned for seymours illness both on his own account and that of his interesting charge heaven send us an early and good account of them as to your remark my dear lucy concerning the chaste providential tendency of seymours illness i most heartily hope that you may be in the right but i confess it strikes me in the opposite point of view though i would not tell cornelia so for the world and perhaps it is merely because i remember a whimsical speech made by a curious old gentleman who used to visit my father very often and delighted to make us girls laugh by the oddity of his remarks upon love and matrimony his neverfailing subjects of discourse this said old gentleman once gave the following caution to my mother madam said he with an arch and humorous solemnity of face permit me to advise you never to employ a young woman to attend a sick man unless you wish to make a match between them for i have always observed in these cases that the first use which a convalescent makes of his reviving strength is a grateful tender of it to his nurse and the good girl is so delighted to see a sick man growing well again that she has no heart to contradict him  there is a short story for you as an epilogue to the long one heaven grant it may make you smile without being any bad omen for cornelia mercy on us if any such things should happen as the recollection of this nonsensical old proser has put into my head deuce take him for starting up in my memory but not a word more for here comes cornelia with two maps in her hand to show me all the route of the travelers ah poor stricken deer well i must positively close with all our love to you both dear girl send us some good news the first moment that you have it in your power and remember that my pacquets to you are as voluminous as an old counsellors opinion so pray imitate the lawyers on your part and be not sparing in reply farewell  letter xvi seymour to edmund audley from my batteau on the rhone alive alive my dear edmund behold me floating down the rhone by the side of the lovely and now smiling giuliana do not therefore let your kind apprehension suggest to you that i may be crossing the styx with old charon my present voyage is a thousand times better for i was never more disposed in my life to relish the charms of this world every thing i see is beautiful every thing i taste is delicious if this is the usual effect of a recovery from sickness i would willingly be sick once a year there is one thing however that puzzles me to account for as you are a profound speculator and as you love to ruminate on the variety and oddity of human sensations i propose to your sage worship the following query for your solution why was i a good and faithful platonist a month ago when i was in the full vigor of health and why at this season when i am little more than half restored from a state of debility why do i feel a desperate inclination to the philosophy of epicurus what strange creatures we are it seems to me as if all our wit and stupidity our wisdom and folly our virtues and vices depended on a few drops more or less of the red white and yellow fluids that are perpetually changing in these tragicomical machines that we call human bodies i am this moment a striking illustration of my theory i seized a pen all gaiety to write you at least the beginning of a gay epistle on board the motion of the boat as i write has moved my bile made me half squeamish and behold my gaiety turned to a dull dissertation on the mechanism of man of which like many who have attempted to explain it i know nothing but this i know that when the manly machine is out of tune nothing can put it to soon into harmony as placing it within the influence of an enchanting female so allow me to throw down the pen and take a few turns on the short deck of our vessel with my sweet messmate giuliana i will finish this as soon as we land at the village where we mean to dine  i am now on shore but tossed at this moment in one of the most disquieting halftempests of heart and mind that i ever experienced alas my dear edmund i have played the fool most abominably i reproach myself and what is worse i feel incessantly that i still more deserve your reproaches but that you may not from these imperfect intimations suppose my offenses more flagrant than they have been i will give you a very full and frank history of the extreme folly by which i have poisoned the pure delight that in spite of sickness itself i had enjoyed till this luckless day in the faithful discharge of my trust  after a most pleasant and short days voyage the kind considerate giuliana thinking me more an invalid than i am and desirous that i should avoid the evening air on the river contrived for us to take a late dinner at a delightful village where we are also to pass the night our hotel is a new and elegant little structure uilt after an english model with bow windows ommanding one of the most enchanting prospects that the eye can behold our landlady has been particularly recommended to giuliana t lions and not without reason for she seems to pssess in very rare and happy proportions the vity of france and the netness of holland in high delight with this singular and most agreeable auberge i and my lovely companion after a cheerful dinner in one of its upper apartments were leaning together on the open bowwindow that commands this delicious country when chance or the devil call it which you will presented a sight to me that in an instant st fire to all the reviving wanton blood in my veins yet it was by no means a sight of licentous pleasure but one that rather favored of primeval innocence and the golden age out ndow commanded a very pretty cottage with a little vineyard and flowergarden the happy master of this diminutive kingdom is it seems a scotch catholic who after passing a few years in the french service settled here with a very beautiful fairone of this country having a passion for gardening and being still in the prime of life he draws a most healthy and delightful ubsistence from wine fruit and flowers the prodce of his little domain the business of the vintage is all past for this year but it seems this honest man has a sensible goodnatured custom of rewarding his handsome wife and sweet children for their labors in that busy season by saving for them as a treat after their toil a little portion of his most exquisite fruit we happened to behold him in the instant of collecting and distributing this reserved treasure figure to yourself my dear edmund a fine tall military florid fellow stretching out his manly rame at the top of a ladder to reach some hunches of magnificent grapes at the lofty extremities of a broken rock part of which he had fashioned into a gardenwall observe toward the feet of the ladder a little goldenheaded boy like a cherubim who has crept up four or five steps and is bolding up the hollow of his hat while his mother a woman as comely as luxuriant in beauty as pomona herself holds one side of the ladder while two beautiful little girls both older than the boy seem to delight themselves in thinking that they support the other behold the happy father descending with a neat open basket well filled in his hand his children form a little circle around him each receives a luxuriant bunch of grapes each smiles with content and transport at the allotted share thus far all is well but the honest man having kissed each of his children in distributing his presents upon delivering the residue of the fruit and the basket to their smiling mother throws his left arm around her and gives her so hearty a kiss a kiss so marvellously expressive of connubial happiness that an old hermit in seeing it must have longed for a wife no words can tell you the kind of electric fire that it seemed to communicate to all my fibers giuliana moved from the window under the pretense of helping herself to a glass of water i could not forbear following her and i exclaimed what a couple of simpletons are you and i my dear giuliana you are solicitous to save the soul of a father who may not perhaps thank you for your intention and i to gain the heart of a widow who has perhaps already bestowed it on a more fortunate suitor how much wiser would it be in both of us to settle together in this delicious country and act the sweet scene that we have just beheld in a vineyard of our own in uttering the last word i imprinted an hasty kiss on her lips i had never made the slightest advance toward touching them before and her extreme surprise did not allow her either time or presence of mind sufficient to shrink from my caress but if you wish to know how she looked on the occasion imagine to yourself my dear edmund an attic priestess in the moment of seeing an altar which she had guarded with the devoutest fidelity profaned by a barbarian indignant displeasure lightened from her eyes her whole countenance expressed the rebuke of an offended angel and i believe she was on the point of uttering some words of great severity but she checked herself and remained silent a few moments i fancy my appearance affected her it must have been very singular for the flame of wanton desire which had i confess a momentary existence in my bosom had sunk in the smouldering vapor of vexation and remorse the agitation of these opposite feelings had given such a tremulous weakness to my unbraced nerves that i believe giuliana soon beheld me rather as an object of pity than of terror i absolutely had not power to speak and after a short pause giuliana said with a plaintive gentleness of voice and manner a thousand times more affecting to me than any vehement acrimonious reproof could have been this is very wrong and very unexpected in my generous guide do not seymour do not so cruelly destroy the sincere satisfaction i felt in being the instrument under god of preserving your life closing this tender reprimand with a look still more expressive of her own wounded feelings she left the room and i felt as if i had heard my good genius say you are become unworthy of my care and i abandon you to a legion of infernal tormentors my heart indeed was full of such visitants i traversed the room in vain to shake them off my attempts were equally fruitless whether i tried to reason or to laugh myself out of my bitter vexation pho nonsense said pride to comfort me after all what is your mighty crime barely touching the lip of a very beautiful woman with whom you were alone aye but says conscience you know there are certain situations in which a simple kiss may seem an outrage as cruel as absolute violation it is in these tender points where a delicate heart and mind are concerned that nothing is but thinking makes it so whatever selfflattery can suggest in my defense the troubled look of giuliana imprinted on my heart refutes every syllable of my delusive advocate i find no relief but in the most perfect repentance when i had brought my mind into a tolerable calm by penitent resolutions of making all the atonement in my power for having so ungratefully offended my divine companion i sat down to give you this history i am now jaded with wing giuliana is not returned to me i feel like a wretch as i am that i hardly deserve to see her more yet i must enquire where she is  death and distraction i may not see her for these two hours she is gone with giannina and the hostess heaven knows whither i deserve it all but her absence is more torturing to me than either the looks or language of her displeasure some demon has surely had the conduct of this whole day it was from a perverse incident of his contrivance that giannina happened to have left us alone after dinner for i have constantly made a point of treating the  more as a relation than a servant to giulina and of course we have had her perpetually  our presence till this unfortunate afternoon  i am this instant interrupted by a message from an obliging english traveller who is just setting off for lions and has kindly offered to take charge of any little packet that i may wish to dispatch i am much more inclined to commit this epistle to the flames than to any conveyance whatever yet in recollecting that my last may have filled your affectionate heart with painful apprehensions for my life i think it best to send you the speediest account i can of my reviving health though i show you at the same time that i hardly deserve to live indeed i shall hardly desire a longer existence than may suffice for me to reconcile giuliana and her father for i feel that i have forfeited all claims if i ever had any to the love of that irreproachable angelic creature whose very name my lips are now become unworthy to pronounce cornelia how should i presume to call her my cornelia as i fondly used to do when i reflect that she never faltered in the execution of long irksome and painful duties for which she was often repaid they say by querulous ingratitude and that i heavens what a contrast that i have villainously failed in one delicate and honorable duy though i felt the faithful discharge of it not only free from pain but absolute delight oh edmund the fever that has ceased to prey on my frame and that i thought so grievous was ease and pleasure compared to this new kind of fever that i feel at this moment in my mind i am sick with the worst of all sickness i am sick of myself as i have always found you a most indulgent and soothing fatherconfessor in my most impetuous and extravagant follies let me conjure you to be so now pray let me find on my arrival at genoa such a letter from as may tend to tranquillize my perturbed spirit and make me less odious to myself by showing me that you still retain some esteem for your most sincere and affectionate etc  p s giuliana is not yet returned and i cannot detain this another instant adieu    letter xvii from miss audley to mrs audley take back to yourself my dear harriot the fine title you bestowed on me it is you who are the real conjurer you are the true prophetess o man man inconstant abominable man in sober truth now i could lamost weep to think that in reply to your most delightful history of cornelia i have a sorry anecdote to tell you of her too agreeable infidel who seems to prove himself as unorthodox in the nice points of love and honor as he is supposed to be in the essential article of religion alas how would the tremulous heart of our poor cornelia palpitate if she knew what i have learnt this morning that the wicked rogue has been wantonly kissing his lovely afflicted fellowtraveller o heavens i hear you exclaim but hush hush my dear harriot drop not a word i conjure you that may suggest such a tormenting idea to the tender widow in truth all this terrific affair was nothing but the idle frolic of a moment and the rogue has made himself such a frank confession and expressed so much sincere contrition for his offense that we ought perhaps to be rather quieted than alarmed by the incident let us act therefore as true charity does with greater sinners and conclude that his past wickedness will only furnish him with a surer foundation for his future virtue you and i my dear harriot may rest perhaps on this conclusion but it would not do for the disquieted cornelia i know by woeful experience that ideas which act as an opiate on the moderate apprehensions of friendship may produce nothing but an increase of irritation on the wild and feverish terrors of love pray observe what a wondrous philosopher i grow in living so much with our dear speculative edmund indeed he kindly lets me into many mysteries to which i should be otherwise an utter stranger and the knowledge of them has no little influence in securing that degree of content which i have happily recovered there was a time you may remember when i wished to be a young man of a good figure and an independent fortune supposing as i believe many misses suppose that such a character sports in the world at his pleasure as in a perfect paradise i have now very different ideas of this being once so envied an opulent young man of strong passions acute sensibility and with no wellsettled principles such in short as they most of them are such a character i say now strikes me as resembling the dancers that i have read of in some barbarous nation who twist torture and wound themselves a thousand horrible ways under the name of gaiety and diversion it is true indeed as row has sweetly told us that man the lawless libertine may rove free and unquestioned through the wilds of love   but what does he generally find in these rovings so delightful to a young and credulous fancy what are his adventures in this alluring wild why truly at one thicket he encounters a tigress in another he is slung by an adder or if he is one of the lucky mortals who meet with a milder destiny in this said variegated wild still in stooping to gather a primrose it is ten to one but he pricks his fingers against an hedgehog but what a simple chattering monkey am i myself in thus running into a fantastic dissertation on libertines when i only meant to assure you in a few simple words that you and your lovely friend may be perfectly easy concerning the health of our interesting travelers i wish of all things to enclose to you seymours letter to edmund but the rigid philosopher says no adding with a kind of severity if cornelia should accidentally catch a sight of the hand and petition for a perusal of the letter the sympathetic harriot has not fortitude enough to refuse nor could she indeed with any very good grace you must allow there is some reason as well as goodnature in this argument so if your curiosity my dear harriot teizes you a little on this point as i fear it will i can only say as hamlet does to his dear horatio oermaster it as you may  i ought perhaps to proceed like hamlet and bind you by a solemn form of adjuration so come my dear prepare yourself to take the oath i require swear to me upon your fan which is a ladys sword swear i say not to make known what you have heard to night nor by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase nor by ambiguous giving out denote that you know aught from me   i would not for the world be accidentally the instrument to wound your cornelia i most cordially wish her happy though i fear she has but little chance of being so i know how dangerous it is to love a man for whom our esteem cannot keep pace with our affection but away with these gloomy presages heaven bless her to the utmost of her fond expectation and preserve me as i am in maiden meditation fancyfree  a curious prayer this on my part when i am just sallying forth to take captive the noble general who has lately settled in our neighborhood we are to dine with him today i dressed very early on purpose not to captivate him my dear but to scribble to you without the dread of scribbling as you know i have sometimes done without thinking of my dress till the very moment the carriage was ordered among my late philosophical observations i have observed there is nothing which the lordly creature man dislikes more than to be made to wait for a woman who has no means of repaying him for her delay  well here is the dear lordly edmund himself just come into my room to tell me the chariot is at the door and let me add there is a new horse to it which is so like a man that he cannot wait with patience and is at this instant pawing up the newlaid gravel under his feet horse and man be as impatient as ye please i cannot lay down my pen till i have told my dear harriot the saucy speech edmund has just made to me especially as he delivered it as a kind of maxim for the grand purpose of teaching a spinster how to choose a husband come lucy said my dear dictator come and set your cap at the general the love of a young man is like a dram if it does not intoxicate it inflames and undermines the health but the love of a man in middle life is like wine it does not agitate the animal spirits too furiously but only acts as an excellent stomachick so you see my dear harrriot if i take the general it is nothing more than taking a glass of port by the advice of my physician but as you know i hate to follow prescriptions i trust you will see me like a wise invalid recover all my natural gaiety by prudently and resolutely abstaining from all cordials whatever from this scrawl i think you may conclude that i am growing as great a rattle as i used to be  mercy the horse has begun to rear and if i stay another moment the philosophic edmund will begin to swear so god bless you and believe me ever  your affectionate etc  letter xviii seymour to edmund audley the offended angel has forgiven me but i am not yet reconciled to myself my transgression indeed admits of palliation  and it might have been infinitely greater but what a sorry apology is this my dear edmund was not adam as they tell us banished from paradise for tasting the tree of knowledge though he touched not the tree of life i feel like adam i feel exiled from a mental paradise which i have basely forfeited and can hope to enter no more i may indeed describe the divine giuliana as the adam of milton describes heaven after his offense i saw her placable and mild and i may also say of myself that i have many days give me of grace wherein i may repeat and one bad act with many deeds well done may cover   but i feel that these days of mine like those of poor adam after his fall must be passed in a state very different from my forfeited felicity though giuliana who has seen me not only penitent but halfill again with chagrin and vexation has treated me with great indulgence and kindness yet i too plainly perceive it is not in her own power to recall those pure those tender those deliciously flattering sensations of sisterly love toward me which my folly has dispelled i have heard those who drink more freely than we do my dear edmond declare that there is a certain pitch of pleasure as you approach toward intoxication which gives you an idea of celestial delight i cannot say i have felt this to the exquisite degree they describe in any convivial festivity but i maintain there is something which answers their description in a certain period of perfect friendship with a modest beautiful afflicted woman in the chaste familiarity and entire confidence of giuliana there was an inexpressible charm which approached nearer to angelic bliss than all the raptures of triumphant love like a brutal idiot as i was i have destroyed this charm for ever since as i have told you already it is not in the power of the lovely forgiving angel herself to restore it but i will cease to weary you with this fruitless lamentation and tell you the progress of our journey  after a most tranquil voyage in which the three gentlest elements water earth and air seemed to smile upon us as if they vied with each other in a wish to please us we arrived last night at avignon our progress down the rhone which is by no means so rapid as i expected to find it would have proved indeed a perfect jaunt of pleasure if our minds had been in harmony with the scene around us but this was far from being the case poor giuliana was frequently absorbed in melancholy reveries and as to myself being neither sick nor well nor happy nor wretched my affections and my imagination instead of doing what they ought to have done instead of contributing to the proper and salutary exercise of each other seemed to have sunk into a stupid and detestable lethargy together i did not look indeed on this smiling face of nature with such malignant eyes as the devil cast upon eden for i had not vivacity enough in my frame to feel the passion of envy but i stared with heavy sour and most uncomfortable apathy upon a series of animated scenes from which i had expected to catch a tender gaiety of heart and sprightliness of fancy as we drew near avignon i could not help observing to giuliana that we had both discovered somewhat of ungrateful insensibility to the extreme fineness of our weather and prosperity of our voyage she answered by a happy quotation of these charming words from metastasio which i hope you and your fair fellow student lucy are by this time able to construe secondo in guerra o in pace trvano il ostro cor camiano di color tutu gli oggetti   all objects change their color in proportion as they find war or peace in our hearts this quotation applicable to both i have already given you too long an account of my own feelings the poor rickety children of indisposition and folly two miserable parents those of giuliana had a nobler pedigree and deserve a more ample history  the great satisfaction i may say the transient delight which her feeling spirit received from my recovery was soon overcast by many cloudy thoughts she has endured much pain not indeed from the recurring force of her former affliction nor from that disquieting incident of the kiss which my misty imagination has magnified perhaps to a very foolish degree in all that i have said to you upon it  the divine giuliana has adopted a new and much deeper source of disquietude her benevolent and tender mind will interest itself in a point that i have weakly suffered to become the subject of her thoughts though i did not mean that it should ever fall within her knowledge or even within her suspicion this sounds a little like the language of an irishman but a few words will make the bull if it is one intelligible  you must know then that during my fever at lions i had two days of delirium in which they tell me i made some very curious remarks concerning the immaculate conception and diverse articles in the birth parentage and education of a certain mysterious personage whom i should rather have supposed myself likely to mention in the words ascribed to the lively aretine io nol conosco  i do not know him this passed as delirious raving so in truth it was yet had i been in spain perhaps the good folks of the inquisition might have kindly cured my fever by application of their salutary fire  what escaped from me in my frenzy dwelt on the compassionate mind of giuliana at various times she discovered a halfrepressed and halfindulged inclination to search into my religious opinions though you know there is nothing in the world that i detest so much as hypocrisy i resolved on this head to play the hypocrite with my lovely companion on account of her tender afflicted spirits i was pleased however to observe that in her own remarks on various convents that we have passed she showed herself perfectly purified from the nonsensical bigotry of her country i find that peverell had taken peculiar pains to eradicate from her mind all the notions of catholic superstition but at the same time he attached her most firmly to his own persuasion with love for his assistant what tenet might he not have stolen from her mind what might he not have implanted on her tender heart in conversing with her on these topics i was so charmed with the strength and luster of her natural understanding that i suffered my own native sincerity to triumph over my prudence i talked to her as if i was talking to you and as she had led me to speak of hume bolingbroke and voltaire expressed my wonder that such a triumvirate uniting all the powers of reason eloquence and wit had not banished a decaying superstition from every cultivated mind but all our debates on this subject have ended as i believe every conference is apt to do between a man and a woman who differ very widely on any interesting theme arguments have no efficacy opposed to feelings the man loses some portion of his esteem for the intellects of the woman and the woman ceases to revere and to confide in the heart of the man do not suppose however that like most theological disputants we are become bitter enemies no never did you hear of two polemics so tender and benevolent to each other our disputes have indeed some vivacity but not a particle of acrimonious malignity you would have been much affected had you heard the close of our last when giuliana with that graceful energy of gesture so peculiar to herself fell on one knee and exclaimed o my dear peverell if i have loved and continue to love thee with a fidelity of affection agreeable to thy pure spirit grant me before i die to behold this generous but misguided young man made as happy as thou were upon earth in the knowledge of thy god the pathetic kindness of this little prayer pierced me to the soul i kissed her hand bathed it with a tear and begged that we might drop the subject for ever  so ended our conference last night in this ancient residence of the popes never did one of those keen sanctified sensualists labor to make a convert to their interest or their pleasure which were the main points of their pursuit you know in this city with a fervency of spirit equal to that of the dear devout giuliana and zealous as she is i may give her the praise so rarely deserved by any religionists in truly saying that her charity is still superior to her zeal  before we retired to our separate pillows the good creature supposing the state of my bodily and mental health equally unsound made me promise to rest a couple of days in this city before i suffer myself to be shaken over the rocky roads of provence as she withdrew to her chamber she said i will engage to amuse you tomorrow and i shall lead you to make an atonement for some or your past offenses at the tomb of laura which we shall find they tell me within a very short walk from this house she said this to me in her own soft language and with a sweetness of manner that no language in the world could perfectly describe her features in the moment expressed a mixture of melancholy and benevolent that affected me in a mavelous degree and i uttered to myself as i withdrew from her to my own apartment lamour na rien de si tender ni lamitie de si douce   love has nothing so tender friendship nothing so sweet my angelic fellowtraveller having dismissed me to my own chamber with a fancy so full of gentle ideas procured me a dream of happiness in a fortunate visionary marriage with cornelia  that i am destined perhaps to see only in a dream on rising this morning i found the scene very dismally altered not only the delights of my vision were fled but the elements as if angry with us for our insensibility to their smiles have begun to frown upon us in a manner very unexpected an unseasonable and violent rain has been falling for several hours and my good governess giuliana who is full of fears for me without any for herself has insisted on my not venturing abroad and thus given me an opportunity of scribbling to you a letter enormously long and as dull as the weather as to giuliana she has deserted me and is sallied forth under the protection of robert and a very ample umbrella she has promised not to visit the tomb of laura without me and i rather suspect from a word she dropped at her departure that she is gone to a booksellers in quest of some favorite religious author whom she wishes to make her coadjutor in the grand project of my conversion  heaven bless her  i begin to grow restless at her long absence and often turn an anxious eye from my paper to the street oh there she is i spy her from the window this instant on her return and with a face of such joyous animation that instead of having picked an old dusty theologian from an obscure shelf i could almost believe she has conjured the soul of poor peverell out of paradise to attend her what can this mean but joy is ever welcome and especially when it approaches in a form of such tenderness and beauty  here she is    oh my dear edmund and no less dear lucy how kind how considerate how unlike the conduct of common friends and worthy of your own quick and benevolent spirits was your fortunate idea of dispatching a packet so delightful with a chance of catching us on our road your obliging friends the two lively brothers who are galloping toward rome luckily drove into avignon while the faithful robert was waiting for his mistress at the door of the bookseller i have mentioned my lords valet happened to be an old acquaintance of roberts and after shaking the honest fellow by the hand informed him that his master had letters for me robert instantly imparted these glad tidings to giuliana who wishing to have the delight of delivering the packet to me herself desired to have it brought to her where she was this most welcome this transporting packet is now in my hands but before i reply to a line of it i must exclaim like some happy being whose name i have forgot heaven i had a soul to endure pain now give me one to support delight i believe indeed that the good giuliana thought me sinking into a new sort of delirium when she beheld me kissing in an ecstacy that enchanting morsel of paper on which the blessed hand of lucy assures me that if cornelia has a partiality for any man on earth it is unquestionably for me and then bids me deserve her  deserve her o ye powers who preside over love and felicity what would i not do to deserve her  by heaven methinks it were an easy leap to pluck bright honor from the palefaced moon aye verily my dear edmund i would do more for love than the noble hotspur could meditate for honor  but here comes my divine monitor to moderate my rapture i have scribbled these few hasty expressions of joy and gratitude while giuliana has been adjusting her dress for our visit to the church of the cordeliers  your charming and magical letter seems to have given serenity to the sky as well as to our hearts it is a delicious afternoon and we are just sallying forth to pay our devotions at the grave of laura  to see that buried dust of living fame whose tomb fair love and fairer virtue kept i shall still add to this voluminous letter before we leave avignon but i will not lay down the pen even for a short pause without assuring you that the tender giuliana takes a most friendly i may say lively interest in those transports of hope which have so kindly awakened in my reanimated frame and still more does she share with me in the sincere joy that i receive from these utterly unexpected and therefore more delightful assurances of your welfare and your regard for the two travelers who both love you and your sister with all the warmth that friendship and gratitude can inspire  we are now just preparing for our departure from this remarkable city whose curiosities have entertained us beyond my expectation but it is to you my dear friends distant as ye are that we are indebted even for this entertainment for had not your enchanting letter put us into tune i should have continued to stare at the objects that solicited my notice with all the speen of smell fungus what curious machines we are  the human heart appears to me like a clock good for nothing unless frequently wound up by the hand of affection you have now converted mine into a fine timepiece of ornamental and lively mechanism in which a multitude of the most cheerful little images are at work together by means of that mighty spring which you have so happily put in motion  i wish i may reward you by accomplishing every thing you wish with the father of giuliana  i think i shall and ground my hopes on some particular lines in his character which i have collected from her and will tell you hereafter i must now hastily close these voluminous dispatches but not without telling you how ardently we wished that you and lucy could have shared the pensive delight we enjoyed at the tomb of laura we were fortunate however in our attendant having met with the most polite and intelligent priest that ever fell in my way he was enchanted with giuliana who inspired by the scene repeated some passages of petrarch with a grace and pathos of magical that i expected to see the shade so laura expressing her satisfaction in these pleasing honors giuliana will not allow the sonnet to be genuine which was found in the tomb and which our books of travels exhibit to you as copied from the handwriting of petrarch  apropos of poets the polite cordelier i have just mentioned observing our passion for poetry and hearing that we were to travel acrose provence has kindly recommended to my perusal a latin poetical epistle of the famous chancellor de lhopital describing the country we are to pass giulianas bookseller has furnished me with a copy of this most respectable poet i was before only acquainted with his political integrity if i find his verses equal to the praise with which the friendly cordelier recommended them to me you shall hear more of them in my next i can now only add that giuliana and i bestow on you and the dear compassionate lucy our most cordial benedictions  adieu  letter xix cornelia to mrs audley alas my very dear and too penetrating harriot how much better do you understand your poor confused cornelia than she understands herself how perfectly verified do i now find the words which you spoke to me with such tender raillery in pressing me to remain longer under your friendly roof when you told me than tearing my troubled heart from the comfort of your sympathetic conversation to fortify it in the solitude of my own dreary mansion was aking a child out of leadingstrings before it had strength to go alone a child indeed my et confidante a very weak child i confess and as unfit i perceive to be left alone as any infant of the nursery why do they tell us that solitude is the nurse of sense it maybe so perhaps with man  but with woman i fear it is only the nurse of folly and the cherisher of passion at least my dear harriot i will honestly confess to you that it proves so with your weak cornelia  what different hopes had i conceived what a sage heroine did i fancy myself in accomplishing my painful resolution of quitting the daily converse of that beloved friend whose too tender indulgence to my dangerous prepossession i conceived to be a delicious poison to my quiet if not to my integrity in the delusive pride of good intention i expected that the scenery here would restore me to peace as i knew that every object around me would set the poor departed sedley most forcibly before my eyes i hoped to grow strong in the contemplation of his virtue and to impress still deeper on my heart the kind religious admonition which his dying tenderness bestowed on me i am very far from feeling none of the impressions which i expected this habitation to make upon my mind in some moments perhaps i feel such impressions too strongly like a person whose fits of feverish strength are succeeded by a proportionate weakness you have entreated me to give you a very full and frank account of all my sensations and surely you who have taken such generous pains to tranquillize my bosom have an unquestionable right to enquire into all its emotions but do not tell me dear harriot that i delight in very iniquitous selfaccusation when i say that i am sometimes too seraphic and sometimes infinitely too like the weakest of mortals when i set my foot in the library of poor sedley which is just as he left it every volume seems to speak to me of its buried master and the piercing eyes of his portrait over the chimney search my very soul banish from me as long as i behold them every perilous propensity and inspite me with a vain wish for the faculty of proving both a mother and a father to the dear boys he has left me  i want not indeed any monitor to quicken the energy of my maternal feelings my sweet little ones engross and amuse the greater part of my day but there are hours you know my dear harriot in which our children cease to be our companions when i have resigned my two lovely boys to their early rest and read william to sleep which he generally wheedles me to do i have still some pensive hours to myself and those very hours perhaps in which a tender heart is most inclined to indulge itself in foolish tenderness as i am passionately fond you know of a contemplative walk at the close of day i frequently take a late ramble alone to that side of the park from whence i can cast an eye of pious meditation upon the grave of my poor sedley  the spot never fails to draw me into a very soothing religious reverie and at these times indeed i am in heaven with him but alas my harriot in proportion as i advance in my return to the house my celestial thoughts fade away and a living image steals upon my mind  the bewitching figure of the too agreeable seymour haunts me with more than ostly importunity he tells me with that tender but respectful insinuation which baffles all resistance in our visionary intercourse that instead of being such a dangerous character as my dear dying monitor wished me to avoid he is exactly the reverse the very protector that sedley wished me to acquire full of the most disinterested love to me and of the fondest affection to my promising little orphans  ah my dear harriot this visionary intruder on my quiet has learned to plead his cause with all your fascinating arguments but even these must not avail him for o my dearest harriot excellent creature as you are in this one point alas i feel that heaven is against you though rebel nature holds out half my heart  what a weak simpleton i am to continue talking thus incessantly of a man whom i have prosed myself not to think of why indeed uld i think of him in any light to awaken  wshes or fears there is little chance of s ping an object of peril to me since i am seured by the very circumstances which poor eloisa prays for in the anguish of her devout apprehension there are heaven knows at present barriers enough between me and this soulterrifying seymour as i may now perhaps say with literal truth alps rise between us and whole oceans roll  alas who knows if he may ever repass the mountains and the seas that divide us he has already we know been once at the point of death in his travels should he have a relapse on his journey we shall have little chance indeed of ever beholding him again and this accomplished this enchanting seymour whom i sometimes wildly consider as a character of terrific impiety may lose perhaps his generous life in an act of the truest christian charity that ever noble youth was engaged in ah my dear harriot my foolish eyes are filled with tears at this idea yet my reason tells me there is another event much more probable and my folly tells me that the pain i should feel   but as you my dear confessor know all the suggestions of my folly even before i discover them myself i will add no more on this subject i have sufficiently complied with your request and given you in the preceding pages of my letter an internal view of my heart and the various sensations that have shaken it on my return to this place let me entreat you to take no advantage of the weakness i have so honestly exposed to you but let us faithfully adhere to the agreement we made in our last conference on this perpetual topic let us abstain from all arguments on both sides of the question and leave my future destiny to time and chance to assume a little honest pride and convince you that your weak cornelia is not quite so far gone in this desperate malady of the heart as my dear n pathetic harriot supposes i will show you  i can scribble many pages to you upon other subjects before i dispatch this packet by the rustic courier who to avoid the long circuit and delay of the post is to pass regularly every fortnight by the short private road between us i will endeavor to amuse you with two incidents of a very different nature that have happened since my return  the first is a little rural adventure that affected me very much as your sister lucy has often talked of amusing us with a novel of her own composition pray tell her that i think her lively genius might raise an admirable little pocket volume from the singular story i am going to tell you as i have not the talents of our dear lucy for embellishment i must content myself with giving you the simple matter of fact  you know that the humane disposition of poor sedley made him not only the friend but the physician of the poor and during hi long illness i have been used to act as his deputy in that character as i was taking an afternoon walk with the children and their maid near the private door of the park that open on the little common i saw a lad running with great violence toward us and opened the door to enquire into the cause of his agitation as soon as he could collect sufficient breath he informed me that the maid at the farm which you see from the gate i have mentioned was fallen into terrible fits and he was bid to run as fast as he could to the great house for madams advice i was very ready to obey the summons and sending nanny home with the children i ordered her to dispatch the grave and experienced philip after me with some pungent restoratives a walk of little more than half a mile brought me to the beautiful poor excruciated patient i wish i had the talent of description to give you a perfect image of the scene that now presented itself to my attention figure to yourself my dear harriot a fair florid robust luxuriant beauty of nineteen under the horrid influence of agonies that made her large distorted eyes roll like meteors and her two even rows of strong white teeth grind each other with convulsive ferocity but i need not strive to paint for you a most distressing figure of which you have almost a real portrait in your own house from the pencil of rubens in the sublime sketch which your good husband values so highly of the saint preparing to dispossess two female demoniacs you have a very forcible representation of my unhappy patient at the moment i first beheld her i should say however that she is a thousand times more beautiful than the youngest figure of rubens though her form has all that rich muscular beauty in which he delighted the humanity of the farmer and his wife had placed the poor creature in their best chamber but her contorsions were so violent that four very strong men could hardly hold her down on the bed and could not prevent her exposing to our view her whole bosom which seemed to be distended and tortured with internal fire though it retained the most snowy whiteness that i ever beheld in a human skin you will think her beauty must be great indeed when i tell you the idea of it forced itself upon me in spite of all the torment under which i beheld it and which i felt the most sincere anxiety to relieve by various applications i had soon the delight of releasing her from these horrible convulsions i then desired to be left alone with her and seating myself on the side of her bed prepared to administer in soothing conversation a cordial to her heart from whence i suspected this tremendous malady to have arisen ah my dear harriot what a furious distemper is this pestilent love how can you be so cruel as to aim at persuading me to resign my bosom to the dominion of such a demon all the terrific contorsions i have just described to you were in truth the sport of this tyrant by expressing what i really felt a great desire to be her friend i drew from the good simple girl all the secrets of her agitated bosom a young blacksmith it seems who has i suppose no resemblance to vulcan but in his trade his obtained an absolute sway over the heart of this rustic venus and the immediate cause of her tremendous agony was nothing more than this petty circumstance the barbarous cyclops as lucy would call him had been at a neighboring fair the preceding day and had passed the abode of the damsel without bringing her a knot of remembrance or calling to say a kind word to her either as he went or as he returned the sprightly lucy who thinks she has courage enough to whip the malicious little archer cupid with his own broken arrows would i believe with her benevolent pleasantry have rallied my simple patient out of her sufferings and by teaching her to laugh at her own fondness would have her in a new fit of mirthful shame hide her fine blushing face under the bedclothes but i who am as far as possible from possessing our dear lucys invaluable faculty of laughing away pain either from myself or from another i was obliged to pursue an opposite system for the relief of my interesting patient not having either the talent or the disposition to make her laugh with me i indulged all my own weakness and began very sympathetically to weep with her there was in truth such a natural and affecting simplicity in the poor girls account of the anguish of heart she had endured and of her ineffectual struggle to suppress it that i am almost inclined to think the gay lucy herself would have wept at the recital my sympathy was not without some good effect by flattering the honest creatures pride it seemed to give some energy to her mind which had sunk under the complicated oppression  grief indignation and despair  i endeavored to persuade her that this cruel  was a mere accident the young man ht be engaged in business for his master at would not allow him to stop hope the  my good jenny said i it is not likely  a man who has given you such expectations ould desert so lovely and modest a girl as you e i dare say that by this time next year i shall not only have the pleasure of seeing you married but i shall see you with a beautiful lit tant in your arms as i uttered these chearing words an undescribable halfsmile flashed like lightning across the dark clouds of her expressive countenance it was the momentary triumph of fond imagination over settled sadness of heart  being very desirous to prevent a return of her convulsions and thinking that a visit from her lover would most effectually secure her from a relapse i offered to send for him immediately but the good girl with a becoming pride petitioned against his being sent for though i could easily perceive that her soul panted for a sight of him as the evening was now come i prepared to leave her requesting that she would be as quiet and endeavor to get as much sleep as she could in the course of the night and i promised to visit her soon in the morning she expressed her obligations to me with an humble yet passionate gratitude that affected me much and the more as i discerned an alarming degree of wild inquietude in her features on my return home i amused myself with the project of setting the troubled heart of this fair simple maiden at ease for life i charged the discreet philip to set out by daybreak and conduct this beloved blacksmith to me by my early breakfasthour without letting him know the private business for which i wanted him what a charming alacrity does any benevolent project give to the spirits i had not waked any morning since my return with such comfortable and cheerful sensations as i felt in rising to prepare for the reception of the rustic stranger my eager fancy delighted itself with a vision of the great happiness which i thought myself about to confer on two deserving creatures who though in an humble rank of life possessed every thing that could render love a source of happiness to themselves and an object of pleasing contemplation to their friends i expected to see in this fortunate son of vulcan a fine image of manly strength and engaging simplicity corresponding to the feminine graces of his fair admirer i waited his arrival with great impatience and anticipated in my thoughts the pleasure i should have in seeing the burst of surprise joy and gratitude in the varying features of a young honest open rural countenance at length the punctual philip returned but what was my astonishment when he led into my apartment an illmade ugly sallow sourlooking fellow more fashioned to convulse the heart of beauty with terror than with love half my sympathetic warm wishes for the marriage of poor jenny and i am afraid half my esteem for the good girl died away at the first glance i cast on her grimvisaged swain but when i recovered a little from my surprise i began to hope that his understanding and his fidelity might make us some amends for the defects of his figure i talked to him on his good fortune in being so sincerely beloved by a charming good girl and asked if he had any plan of marrying her very soon i wish my dear harriot you could have beheld the halffarcical halftragic visage of the brute when he replied in his rough dialect no madam i bent such a fool there be two wenches in our parish that i loves better than she i was now seriously mortified for i lost all hope of accomplishing the little good that i had pleased myself with the prospect of doing and i began to think the simple jane had suffered herself to be sadly overcome by a very gross passion for which the savage animal before me could furnish us with no decent apology but in this idea i did the poor girl much injustice for a very singular and striking incident that i shall relate to you presently convinced me that her passion had not only all the strength but i may say all the chastity of genuine love i resigned all my hopes and indeed all my wishes to form the match i intended but i was still anxious to restore the health of the girl i represented to her sullen swain that she had been very ill and that i wished him to walk with me to see her not for any matrimonial purpose but merely to comfort her spirits by the gentle civility of a friend these were niceties of behavior that the surly cyclops did not well comprehend and he seemed to be alarmed as if i had proposed to catch him in a net more subtle than his old master vulcan is said to have contrived on a different occasion i thought he would at last refuse to attend me but while i was putting on my hat philip by argument or by ale put his terrors and his perversity to flight and we set forth all together for the house of the damsel i went first alone into her chamber and found that she had been afflicted with a return of her fits after my departure in the preceding evening her night had been restless and all her features expressed that she had suffered much not only from the absence of sleep but from inquietude of heart i soon informed her that i had been so lucky as to meet with her friend ned hewson for such is the name given by mortals to this grim son of vulcan and that upon hearing she was not well he had kindly come with me to enquire after her health a sparkle of fond delight and gratitude now flashed from her eyes she was still in bed and on my asking her if i should bring hewson into her chamber she replied with a tender tremulous voice yes if you please madam i now expected to see the triumph of impassioned nature over maidenly bashful reserve i imagined that poor jane would burst into a transport of tears and clasp her grizly undeserving idol in her arms indeed i had some doubts if propriety would permit me to stay and gratify the curious wish which i confess i felt very strongly to see the effect of their meeting thinking however that my medical character was a complete sanction for me i ventured to stay and am very glad i did so as i beheld a scene very different from my expectations and one that restored to the good girl all that portion of my esteem which i told you she had lost in the course of my reflections on her amor i called hewson into her room and as he approached her bed she held out her hand to meet his with an air of very modest affection then looking tenderly upon him she replaced her head on the pillow and in the space of a minute sunk into the profound and sweet sleep of an infant nothing could have surprised nothing could have affected me more all the language in the world could not so well have expressed to me how completely i had relieved her poor tortured bosom by the new and singular opiate which i had so luckily brought the very striking contrast between her present deep delicious repose and her past wild agonies and wakeful melancholy led me into a train of reflection on that formidable passion which has so extensive and so instantaneous a power to produce either a tempest or a calm in the human bosom while i sat a considerable time gazing intensely on the sweet sleeping countenance of poor jenny my eyes were filled with tears of pity for her and perhaps of apprehension for myself love seems disposed to be a cruel enemy to us both and there is in truth very little merit in all my anxious endeavors to be a friend to this hapless girl for as my favorite zara says i alas myself have been a slave and when we pity woes which we have felt it is but a partial virtue   the cases indeed of poor jenny and your cornelia are not precisely the same yet i tear we are both destined to be wretched from unfortunate and unsubdued affection but it is high time to quit this weak digression and proceed in my story  now then with grief and shame my muse the sequel of her tale pursues i had persuaded the halfhumanized ned hewson to sit down and wait with me the waking of my fascinated patient when we had sat about half an hour we heard a little tumult below stairs and my companion was called down as the noise did not break the sound slumber of jenny i sat quietly by her without enquiring into the cause of the disturbance but the farmers wife soon brought me a surprising history of the tumultuous adventure and what think you was the source of the noisy contention below why truly it had proceeded from the mavelous attractions and the licentious gallantry of my late companion the hideous ned hewson the parish officers had arrived in pursuit of him and carried him off as their prisoner and for what no  not as you suppose to comfort and restore the credit of one poor pregnant weeper   but to make his election of two rival queens in that condition who alarmed i suppose by their swains visit to me and the rumor raised concerning it had in the same moment and before the same magistrate urged with great vehemence their equal claims to this tremendous alexander the blacksmith  but i am quite sick of this impudent ugly savage and as i dare say you will be so too i will dispatch as briefly as i can the little residue of this long story as i happened to want a laundrymaid i prevailed on the farmers wife so let me take jenny immediately in that capacity i knew that a change of place would be the best plan to quiet that anguish of heart which i was convinced the good simple girl would feel on the first hearing of an event which i therefore wished to communicate to her myself with a preparatory sermon when i had settled her in my own house i informed her that the perfidious hewson as a proper punishment for his various infidelity was just condemned to matrimonial bondage with a bustling vixen who would most probably render his future as turbulent as his past life has been licentious  some natural tears she dropped but wiped them soon and although her features have still the traces of deep melancholy i hope to restore her by degrees to content and cheerfulness though i know alas by experience that when these blessings are once lost they are not easily recovered thus it is both in high and low life  love leads to folly either bodily or mental and folly ends in bitter disquietude if not in lasting wretchedness but your cornelia is determined if possible to grow wise pray encourage me in this sage resolution and tell me as i try perpetually to tell myself that the mother of two lovely heroic boys ought rather to think of playing the part of minerva than of a sighing arcadian shepherdess especially when i see in the fate of poor jenny how a shepherdess is rewarded for her sighs but i am now in this sage humor just going to take my evening walk of meditation adieu therefore for today my dearest friend tomorrow i will devote some early hour to what i have promised you a history of a different adventure in which the tragicomical confusion fell chiefly on your devoted cornelia it grows late so dearest friend of my bosom good night  and now good morning to you my dear harriot i have just assigned to my dear little literary william his morning task which is more a pleasure than a labor to him and while my sweet liliputian student is sitting quietly by my side more completely absorbed in study than many sages of larger growth i have resumed my pen to tell you how ludicrously and yet how painfully i have been put to the blush by my whimsical westcountry cousin though you have often heard me mention his name i do not believe that i ever gave you a description of this odd mortal and his singular manners if any human creature was ever born under a laughing planet he is the man the very contrast between his name and his figure is a perpetual incitement to laughter suppose yourself my dear harriot a very grave and starched matron seated in due form to receive my relation on his first visit could you do you think preserve the gravity of your countenance on hearing your servant announce mr small and then beholding a huge gigantic mortal six feet high and so immoderately corpulent that he would split into a couple of your common theatrical sir john falstaffs add to this that the comical creature with almost as much real wit as sir john has quite as much jocularity of gesture as an apt his animal spirits are by no means inferior to his bulk and you may suppose therefore that his gaiety like his figure borders on the monstrous yet it is hardly possible to be angry with him let his jests be ever so absurd or insulting a serious insult he can never intend indeed i believe it is as little in his power to be serious on any occasion as it is to be diminutive the very affections that give an air of melancholy to other men have in this creature a very comic expression i believe in my conscience that if he was reading the funeral service the most solemn of all language over a deceased friend that he loved he would utter it in such a manner as to make you rather laugh than weep  and list the soul upon a jig to heaven with such an exterior of grotesque enormity he has one or the most upright benevolent and tender hearts in the world and really performs the actions of a cato or aristides with the fantastic and rogueish grimaces of a scaramouch  this very strange being whom i had not seen for three years entered my dressing room the other day while william and i were reading together by ourselves i wish you could have seen the dear boys look of astonishment not so much at the first appearance of our gigantic cousin as at his curious mode of saluting me which william appeared to be in some doubt whether he should applaud or resent indeed it was not very clear in the first moment whether his salutation was that of a friend or a foe the giant caught me up in his arms exactly as you would take up a little girl of three years old and first swinging me round then gave me a kiss and said i am come my fair cousin to visit you for a few hours just to brush away the cobwebs of solitude and sorrow from this pretty little head of yours he then paid some fine compliments between jest and earnest to my understanding and expressed his great joy at not finding me in weeds your widow in weeds cried he is the silliest looking animal in the creation she is like a young armadillo  an armadillo cousin william is a pig in armor that hides every thing but his nose should not you laugh to see such a droll creature  can he fight so cried william with eagerness and spirit no my brave cousin replied the droll and there lies the best part of my simile the pigs armor instead of proving a real defense only invites the merry mischievous fellows that catch sight of it to try if they cannot drive a pin through it  at this abominable rate he rattled on for about half an hour sometimes making me laugh immoderately and sometimes distressing me almost to tears william by degrees became very familiar with him and really made some very spirited and clever replies to his odd speeches at last this half pleasing halfprovoking and very ponderous jester said to me well my sweet cousin you must not think of moping alone in this noble place it is high time you should have some such pretty little fairylike fellow as i am beginning to dance about you like a jackolantern to enliven the darkness of widowhood what a pity it is that my dear nervous dainty wife did not take her flight to paradise as she threatened to do when i saw you last i should tell you my dear harriot with all this wild rhodomontade he is passionately fond of his wife who is indeed nervous in the extreme and perhaps not the less so for his making a perpetual joke of those fine ladylike appearances which her complaint more than her natural disposition of mind have given to her character the visible languor of her frame is very striking yet in spite of that languor she has contrived to enliven this boisterous giant with a very numerous family and some of its branches he tells me are grown a riotous and as noisy as himself but i return from this digression to the rattling discourse he was addressing to me what a charming match cousin you and i should have made in that case hey my dear william he continued catching up the boy in his arms should not you like such a dapper little playfellow as i am for your new papa william when he reached the ground again stared a moment as if pondering on the question and then said with some drollery of manner i do not believe we have a bed in our house that is big enough to hold you why you ungracious rogue said the giant putting on a pretended sternness of countenance who should you like better than me for a papa as my evil genius would have it the little urchin without being in the least daunted by the feigned austerity of this demand instantly replied mr seymour  ah my dear harriot you will easily guess what a countenance i had at the sound of that name repeated by my arch cousin with a most significant echo and a whistle at the end of it that seemed like the viewhalloo which increases the joy of the hunter and the palpitation of poor puss i attempted in an awkward embarrassed manner to account for the childs partiality but my gay vociferous relation soon interrupted me by saying ah my dear little widow say no more  say no more i see clearly by this crimson banner patting my cheek what a happy conqueror is quartered in the castle of your heart  no no not a syllable of protestation  nay my good little woman do not look so seriously distressed  upon my soul i am very glad it is so i was afraid you might have been foolishly taught to think it proper to be solemn and sober and sad for a century which in your situation would be very nonsensical  by a deluge of words half jocular half tender and all full of real benevolence he utterly prevented my giving him a fair explanation of my foolish embarrassment and he is gone in the full persuasion that i am passionately in love with seymour and determined to marry him i am such a simpleton as to have been much flurried and heartily vexed by this incident though i have such perfect confidence both in the honor and discretion of my rattling cousin that i am convinced he will not mention the idea he has conceived to any living soul except perhaps his wife who is a good woman and no gossip still i am vexed but i have tried to play the philosopher and i make at least some use of my vexation by giving you such a full history of it as may i hope contribute to your amusement pray tell lucy that observing how much her charming long letters delighted you i grew jealous of her and determined to beat her by the length of my scrawls though i cannot rival the brilliancy of her epistles when i cast my eye on the size of this it seems to have been written expressly to make you recant one of your favorite maxims that a letter can never be too long from a person you love i shall forgive you therefore my dearest harriot if you think me too prolix but i shall not forgive you easily if you do not observe to my credit how seldom the name of seymour is repeated in these multitudinous pages written as they are from a heart that delights to display itself to the invaluable bosomfriend of  your most sincere and affectionate cornelia  letter xx from henry seymour to edmund audley antibes let the sea my dear edmund which smiles upon us here with a fair and inviting ace plead my excuse for sending you once in my life a very brief epistle i may well claim the privilege of being laconic after filling so many pages as i contrived to scribble to you in the course of our slow but agreeable progress over the fragrant rocks of provence in perusing my two last pacquets these two letter were lost  note by the editor    how will you and my gentle lecturer lucy stare at each other with looks of satisfactory surprise to find me playing the new and solemn characters of critic and antiquarian by the side of my bewitching fellow traveller but the felucca that i have engaged to transport us to genoa is completely prepared for our reception this felucca let me tell you is such a stout handsome and commodious little vessel that the timid lucy herself would sail in it without a fear i question however if we are able to sail at all for at present there is hardly a breath of air stirring but we have a little sturdy swarthy crew who look to me so illfavored that i could almost suppose them the identical galley slaves described in don quixote perfectly able and ready to brush the deep with their oars  adieu let us now embark as i know we shall with your ardent good wishes for the prosperity of our voyage in proportion as the incomparable giuliana draws nearer and nearer to the residence of her father her feeling heart palpitates with filial anxiety i sympathise with her most cordially in these sensations yet i cherish a comfortable persuasion that i shall speedily gain a great influence over this curious old marblehearted merchant i have endeavored to penetrate all the minutest peculiarities of his character by the reports of his daughter one point i am happily sure of we shall run no hazard of differing on any religious ideas this keen italian by passing several years of his early life in our country contracted a most cordial contempt for the superstitions of his own and he hates a priest i find as heartily as i do as the energetic old humourist johnson says i love a good hater and in my next i hope to send you a lively proof that to hate the same objects with reciprocal energy is no bad introduction to a solid and useful friendship i should be very prolix on this subject were it not high time for us to get on board giuliana salute you both as i do from the bottom of an affectionate and grateful heart i must add the name of my dear cornelia for the mere pleasure of writing it having no time to speak even of her and if i had what could i say that your friendship will not say for me  farewell  letter xxi from the same to the same genoe rejoice my dear edmund in the success of your ambassador again i say rejoice for i am myself quite intoxicated with joy while i inform you that your angelic giuliana is restored to the root to the bosom of her reconciled her transported father  to moderate the pride of my present exultan let me remember and declare that i am not only indebted to your friendship for the honor of my mission but i owe entirely to your excellent  all the delight of its success yes thou our philosopher whose knowledge of nature and whose cool judgment in the conduct of life is so infinitely superior to mine i must frankly own to you that if i had been destitute of your directons for the management of this arduous business the native impetuosity of my temper would have utterly defeated all thebenevolent wishes of my heart and the doors of the angry the exasperated father would have been closed perhaps for ever against the most virtuous and most tender child that ever triumphed over paternal rage and resentment in truth i have had some fiery trials to endure and i flatter myself you will applaud me for having sustained them not only as your confidential friend but as your affectionate and obedient disciple i fear i shall give you but a broken irregular narrative of those affecting scenes that i would wish to relate to you very circumstantially for my nerves which had not perfectly recovered from the shake they received in my late illness have been so variously convulsed in our recent adventures that i do not seem to have one steady fiber in my frame and in the tumult of my present joy though it is certainly a joy of the chastest kind i am more ready to laugh and cry by fits like an hysterical woman than to sit down and commit to paper a long and methodical relation of those events which i am engaged both by honor and inclination to tell you minutely  having collected my thoughts a little and having just received on the back of my right hand an inspiring kiss accompanied by a tear from giuliana who is at this moment in a weeping transport of gratitude to you and to all of us i will endeavor to accomplish my promise and give you with the most exact fidelity all the agitating occurrences of our arrival and reception our voyage was pleasant though not speedy for we had so little wind that we were obliged to make continual use of our oars one of our laborious crew being disabled by sudden illness i ventured to amuse myself by rowing in his place though the poor fellow resigned his oar very reluctantly and would i believe have pulled to his last gasp if i had not insisted on relieving him more for my own amusement than for his advantage he told me truly that i should find it much harder work than i supposed but you know my passion for manly exercise of all kinds and how apt my spirit is to give credit to my body for more strength than it has the tender giuliana remonstrated in vain by kindly reminding me that my health was far from being confirmed man is an obstinate animal and he is never i believe more tempted to overstrain his force than when a lovely woman beseeches him to spare it i sustained however the task i had imposed on myself beyond the expectation of my companions though to confess the truth i felt more exhausted than i would own to them and i should not have related to you so trifling an incident had it not produced a very singular and happy consequence at a future period as you will see in due time but as my history is to be conducted with exact order i have many things to tell you first  as we had the advantage of very serene weather and an early moon i contrived for various reasons not to land in genoa till after the close of day our approach to the city under the soft luster of a clear and delicious evening afforded me one of the most singular and enchanting views that i ever beheld i could have paused for some hours to survey the placid beauty of this semicircular port and its rich crescent of stately palaces with gardens on the roof of each had not the heart of giuliana presented to me a much more engaging subject of contemplation i am you know a passionate admirer of all picturesque scenery but it is not i am persuaded n the power of nature to present any prospect to the eye so perfectly fascinating as the view of a lovely female heart under strong agitation  our present moonlight voyage very forcibly brought to my thought your moonlight visit with my companion to the tomb of peverell giuliana was then under the recent impulse of distracted love and outrageous sorrow yet i question if she could feel more at that time than she felt in the first moments of her return to her native city her anxious desire to regain the affection of her father and to become the minister of his salvation has given a tenderness and a fervor to her spirits beyond every thing that i ever saw in woman in our passage from where we landed to the post house which is our inn we had to pass the house of seignor pinelli in crossing the door of her father as she hung upon my arm i felt a shuddering through her frame that affected me like an electric shock having passed the door she revived at every step like a person who has had the courage to cross an imaginary ghost i looked back to see how it was with our little giannina who followed us close behind and affected as i was myself i could not forbear laughing to observe the good simple girl who was at that instant before the door of the old seignor fortifying herself by the sign of the cross giannina i believe is not more of a catholic than her misress yet so deep does superstition sink into an fant mind that in her present terror she had recourse to a ceremony which she had probably determined to relinquish for ever but i am dwelling too long on petty circumstances behold us now safely arrived at our osteria i shut my females into a chamber together to prevent their being discovered and engaged my civil host in a private conversation to collect from him all possible information concerning the old seignor he behaved i find on the elopement of his daughter as italians generally do under the influence of resentment with a peculiar vehemence both of language and conduct as fiery in his indignation as king lear he publicly disclaimed all his paternal care propinquity and property of blood and being anxious to provide himself with heirs more worthy in his idea of the opulence he has to bequeath he is now said my intelligent informer on the point of marrying a young widow ah seignor added my shrewd host when angry old gentlemen endeavor to punish their young daughters for a little natural indiscretion they are very apt to play the fool themselves and forget that they have not the plea of youth to excuse it my host concluded with many compliments to my countrymen and gave me to understand that if he had himself a fine daughter he should be proud to give her in marriage to an english cavalier without any scruples concerning her body or her soul as soon as i escaped from my talkative landlord i hastened to tell giuliana the matrimonial news of her father she knows the widow perfectly and said with great probability  at if had been actually married to her he must have been completely wretched for life but i am come she added with a fervency or fillal and religious hope  i am come i trust in a ssed hour to save him not only from eternal but even from temporal infelicity how sweet and innocent are these illusions of affectionate piety as far however as she projected wedding is concerned it is probable there may be no illusion in the ardent hopes of our incomparable giuliana but i must not anticipate let me observe if i can the due order of time in the long and interesting history that i have undertaken to give you with that minuteness to which you are so fully entitled from all your generous attention to the excellent creature whose adventures and whose feelings you will expect me to describe  we talked over various plans for gaining admittance to this offended father i was half inclined to shorten the anxious and agonizing suspense of giuliana by trusting entirely to the force of nature and to the tender effect which the sight of a returning affectionate child without any preparation might produce in a parental bosom but on mature reflection i chose to adhere very scrupulously to the conduct you had most kindly and very wisely prescribed to us i went alone to the house of seignor pinelli taking only a short billet of supplication from giuliana which she dated from england according to your advice and i resolved as you recommended not to let the angry old man suspect that his daughter was returned to genoa till i had somehow contrived to soften his resentment and to alarm either his affection or his pride with the dread of such evils as might naturally overtake a desolate young woman in a foreign land  as i had heard of his giving peremptory orders that no englishman should be suffered to enter his doors i thought of personating a french traveller but giuliana assured me i might safely trust to the kindness of her fathers elderly and chief domestic pietro for admission to a conference if not with his master at least with himself she was perfectly right the honest fellow wept like a parent more than a servant in perusing a scrap of paper with three lines addressed to him by the universally idolized giuliana but in showing the tenderness of his own regard for her he gave me a still stronger impression of the obstinate anger which had raged without any remission in the fiery spirit of her father he deplored that old and attached to her as he was from her infancy he was not allowed even the privilege of naming his dear mistress in the presence of her exasperated parent he spoke openly and warmly of his masters new and unpromising matrimonial prospect and he expressed a wish that amounted almost to a resolution of pursuing the steps of the divine fugitive giuliana and dying in her service he labored to dissuade me from the attempt that he conceived to be very painful and fruitless to melt the obdurate heart of pinelli but as soon as i acquainted him with the death of peverell his ideas were totally changed his anxiety for the destitute giuliana amounted to agony and i believe the honest creature would have introduced me to his master had he been sure of being stabbed the next moment for that act of disobedience we both trembled i believe at the instant of that aweful ceremony but as soon as the good pietro flung open the door of a magnificent library i advanced with the firmest countenance i could to salute the majestic and solitary merchant he had been reading alone represent to yourself my dear edmund a very noble figure arrayed in black in whose form and features i immediately discovered an engaging though stern resemblance to those of the beautiful giuliana a figure exhibiting to my apprehension that simple dignity of character which we have frequently admired together in some quiet portraits of titian and had this figure been presented to us on canvass we should i think have guessed it to be a person of eminence in a free republic but this striking appearance of calm grandeur was the vision of a moment the seignor rose at my entrance darting first a look of surprise upon me and then of anger toward pietro who rapidly withdrew to elude the order he expected for conducting me unheard from the apartment in which i had intruded  i accosted the merchant and stopped him before he had time to reopen his door i am come seignor i exclaimed to announce to you the death of a man who has for some time been the object of your just indignation  a very horible accident has put a sudden end to the life of peverell allow me to hope that all your anger and all your unhappiness may be buried in his grave the merchant stood motionless his pride seemed to contemplate in the event that i announced to him all his injuries avenged by the interposition of heaven but his native dignity restrained him from bursting into any indecent exultation he surveyed me with a gloomy sternness and features that expressed the unexpected gratification of a dark and imperious passion but he thought it proper to lay the life or death of a distant ruffian are matters of no moment to me i have only to forget for my own peace that such a villain ever existed with all my heart i hastily replied let his existence be forgotten he was no friend of mine but surely seignor neither you nor i can wish to forget that you have a most lovely daughter who though divided from you by the ocean seems to exist only in your life and expresses to you in this letter her fond filial wishes of being restored for ever to your parental bosom i here presented to him the letter of giuliana which he eagerly seized for no purpose but that of thrusting it into one of the candles by which he had been reading and while the paper was blazing in his hand he said to me fiercely let this convince you young stranger that i have no longer a child and trouble me no more with vain petitions from a wanton ungrateful fugitive against whom i have closed and fortified my heart for ever this speech was uttered with such a steadfast appearance of inflexible severity that i was half petrified at the sound of it but rallying my dismayed spirits to the utmost of my power i pursued my point in the following manner  you will not think it seignor a very difficult point to free yourself from my intrusion when i assure you with the strictest truth that i have no purpose to answer in my visit to you but the purpose of pure humanity that i am led to your house only by compassion for your angelic unfortunate daughter and by good will to yourself i now perceived that the old man began to listen to me with milder attention i derived new spirit from that idea i launched out into a full perhaps a vain account of my own station in life i gave him a circumstantial narrative of the singular the innocent the magnanimous conduct of his child i spoke of you my dar edmund and you will believe i spoke of you with all the enthusiasm of friendship in short i spoke so long and so eagerly that i found my strength fail on a sudden and i was on the point of fainting the old man was affected with great gentleness he placed me on a sopha and called for refreshments as i imputed my sudden languor to what i believe was its real cause the fatigue i had foolishly drawn on myself by the incident of the oar pietro brought in some very fine frut with cakes and cordial wine and the honest fellow cast upon me such a look of solicitous enquiry his keen countenance expressed such a mixture of concern for me and of hope for his mistress that half dead as i was i could hardly help exclaiming honest pietro we shall triumph at last the merchant himself with that singular union of dignity and tendernes in his manner which we have so much admired in his daughter exerted himself assiduously for my relief yet without uttering a syllable that pointed toward a reconciliation with giuliana he observed and i believe very truly that a reclining posture had saved me from absolute fainting and he beged me not to attempt any further discourse till the rich wine whose restorative influence he boasted had recruited my exhausted frame as the giddiness of my head had been relieved by my position i now felt myself as strong in mind as i was weak in body and as you know my dear edmund how i love to eize every opportunity of acting with a romantic spirit you will not be surprised at my resolving to try the influence of this spirit on the dignified merchant while i still reclined and he stod before me with a glass in his hand strongly pressing me to swallow his neversailing cordial dear seignor i exclaimed is it possible that you so charitable to a stranger can sut your heart against your own angelic daughter it it is possible let me rather expire from fatigue and emptiness in your presence than owe my life to a being with a heart so unnatural in saying this with a trembling voice i gently put aside the glass that he was presenting to me the old man was half provoked and half softened by my odd behavior i fear said he looking down upon me with a stern and penetrating glance you are an ungovernable young man rashly wandering from your own parents and losing your senses in a foolish passion for this unworthy girl on hearing this surmise i burst into a passionate protestation of my genuine and pure friendship for giuliana i avowed without naming her my real attachment and hopes of marriage with cornelia to convince him of my truth i offered to relinquish the immediate pretended object of my travels which i had told him was to escort a sickly sister of mine to a relation we had in italy and begged that we might guide him to his daughter in england and return again all together the seignor was greatly touched by the frankness of this proposal and said with an air of mild deliberation whatever your designs may be you are a very extraordinary and interesting visitor if i have wronged you by my suspicions i ask your pardon and i entreat you no longer to reject the cordial for which you have such visible occasion as he held one hand toward me with the wine i seized the other and kissing it replied i have indeed my dear seignor occasion for your kindness but would you show it most effectually for my relief drink yourself the glass you offer me  drink it to the health and happy return of your child  i will pledge you with my whole soul and instead of declining your favors will then bless you with tears of gratitude for your generous hospitality my tears however would not wait for this appointed moment they gushed as i spoke upon the hand of the merchant  there is no contending with you said the halfmelted father and pouring out a second glass for me he complied with my entreaty by drinking the first yet he could not preval on his lips to utter the name of giuliana or to express even a wsh for her return he only said to me in a sort of murmur may the penitent you plead for deserve so disinterested a friend she deserves the friendship of earth and heaven said i starting up in a transport of exultation at having succeeded so far and venting the fullness of my heart in the most fervent vow for the affectionate reunion of a child and parent so worthy of each other and so unhappily divided i at last eagerly swallowed the lacryma christi a wine so called  which my courteous host had so repeatedly recommended as the best of restoratives my stomach indeed acknowledged the excellence of his cordial but my heart and soul felt a still warmer and more delightful effect from my prospect of bending him to my wishes he filled my glass again and to animate me still farther drank himself in a very friendly manner to my perfect recovery his generous wine seemed to operate as happily toward opening his own heart as it did in relieving the languor of my frame yet observing how much he labored to wave all discourse on his daughter i thought it best for me to gain if possible some portion of his esteem by talking on other topics before i pressed him again on that point i had studied the peculiarities of his character and now endeavored to turn them to my advantage how adroit are we made by any passionate and benevolent desire of all talents in the world i have the least pretensions to the talent of flattery yet i contrived to flatter the penetrating merchant very successfully on his republican dignity on the spirit of his ancestors who defended his native city from the tyranny of france on the native and improved vigor of his mind in despising not only the gross superstitions of his country but every species of superstition here you know my dear edmund i was galloping on my favorite ground the subject and the delightful end that i hoped to gain by introducing it assisted by the potent wine i had drank inspired me i believe with unusual eloquence for the old merchant while i kept clear of his daughter appeared to sympathise with me in every sentiment the more i talked to him the more he seemed to covet my acquaintance and at last i flattered him into such a vein of good humor that he insisted on my making his house my home while i stayed in genoa this offer was the great object of my ambition and i thought myself a most capital politician in having obtained it but instead of replying to it by a profusion of thanks and scruples i exclaimed no my good seignor i must not trust myself with such an enchanting companion for you have already made me forget not only my own infirmities but those of my poor sister who is now waiting for me at your post house and if i stay any longer the poor terrified girl will conclude that i have been robbed and murdered in your streets in saying this i prepared to take my leave for the night the courteous pinelli insisted on paying his respects to the lady and conveying her from an house so unfit for a female invalid to his own comfortable mansion his carriage was ordered for this purpose with some difficulty i prevailed on the polite old man to let me be his ambassador on an absolute promise of returning to him with my sister and all our servants in the course of the evening i was now in such an agitation of triumph and impatience to relieve the suspense of giuliana that i could not wait for the carriage but desiring that it might follow me i flew to release my dear anxious prisoner and bless her with the tidings of my success her joy was great but still tempered with apprehension as i had too frankly told her all that honest pietro said of her fathers implacability she was afraid that his quick spirit would catch fire on the discovery of deception and that instead of giving us a cordial welcome as i presumed be would spurn us from his door i was not in deed perfectly free from fear myself on this point but i endeavored to strengthen the hopes of giuliana o said the divine creature all i mean is to prepare you with patience to endure calmly any sudden burst of his resentment as to myself it is my duty to suffer and to embrace all the indignities that can be put upon me and what would i not most cheerfully undergo to regain his affections and to lead him by degrees to a worthier sense of his god such was the devout enthusiasm of this incomparable daughter she had no fears for herself but all for me and her father because she thought that in our tempers we are both precipitate and equally destitute of religious regulation  while she was giving me a divine lecture her fathers carriage arrived her heart fluttered at the sound of it having muffled up both her face and gianninas with a charge not to discover themselves till they were at the feet of the venerable seignor i thrust them hastily into the carriage and we were rapidly driven to his door conceive the palpitation of our hearts my dear edmund at this moment honest pietro let us in and as both the females were effectually disguised by their english bits and the concealment of their faces he marched before us without any suspicion tha his dear mistress was so near him to usher us into a saloon where the seignor with a little collation was waiting to receive us i stepped before the females and said forgive me my dear seignor for presenting to you under the name of my sister the lost but unsullied jewel of this house  giuliana was now kneeling before him and seizing his hand in an agony of tenderness and terror he stood for an instant firm with an averted countenance i never endured in my life an instant of such pain but nature soon declared herself our confederate the old man had not power to persist in his proud indignation and catching up his lovely suppliant child he burst into tears and pressed her to his bosom i wept as plentifully and had as little power of speaking but my heart shouted victoria and seizing the little giannina in my arms i ran off with her to reward the good soul of pietro who was standing in a trance of aweful amazement on the outer side of the halfopen door the honest old domestic was frantic with joy when i sportively threw the returned little fugitive into his arms after receiving a million of his rapid benedictions i ventured to return to a scene still more interesting and more delightful which i had quitted chiefly from a desire of paying the most delicate respect to the sanctity of parental emotions  as soon as i appeared again in the presence of the relenting father giuliana quitted his hand and advancing toward me with a chaste familiarity and tenderness which you who know her and you only can perfectly conceive she embraced me and exclaimed my guide my brother o that our dear edmund and lucy were here to share with us in the sensations of this blessed hour  but they are present in you and embracing me again she added you will tell them how all their divine goodness to me is felt at this moment not only by their grateful giuliana but her kind her dear sympathetic father she now put my hand into his and the strongly affected old man attempted to express his obligation but his heart was yet too full for words he could only speak to me by a pressure of the hand but what language could equal the expressive force of that pressure my heart felt it in every fiber and i declare to you that i question if a touch of tenderness from the hand of my adored cornelia herself could have given me more exquisie delight  ah my dear philosopher you and i have hitherto been fools in our notions of pleasure if we wish to experience the keenest and purest of all human delight let us hasten to be athers o pinelli how exquisite must be thy transport in this event since the mere sight of it is to delicious to a stranger who has known thee but a day  i have still a thousand things to tell you dearest friends though i may literally say i have been writing to you from earliest morn to latest eve allowing very short pauses for necessary refreshment the good merchant very wisely put us al soon to bed last night to day therefore i have dedicated entirely to the pen not only from my extreme eagerness to impart to you at full length the glad tidings of our success but from a  of leaving my interesting host and his incompable daughter as much as possible to themselves that they might unburthen their full hearts to each other  i have not yet had an opportunity of learning from giuliana the particulars of their private conversation yet i am very anxious to do so as i have an unpleasant apprehension of this young widow who has entangled the old merchant as we have so happily restored to him his angelic child it would grieve my soul to have her future life poisoned by his completion of these unpromising nuptials   well my dear governess i obey and will only add a few syllables more to the enormous packet this is my obedient reply to a certain guardian angel commonly called giuliana who has just told me that i shall write myself dead if i do not desist a little from my labor the seignor also says that my letter must be dispatched to save the post so exhausted as i am let me promise you another epistle in a very few days and conclude with our united benedictions  letter xxii from miss audley to mrs audley sent with the preceding letter from seymour read read and rejoice my good harriot thanks to the chaste stars and double thanks to the virtue and kindness of our spirited and excellent young traveller i am enabled to make the very return i most wished to your friendly and delightful communication in restoring to you that enchanting picture which our dear frank cornelia has given you of her own feeling heart how happy am i to join her interesting pages to pages not less interesting from a hand that will now i trust in due time be most happily and holily joined to hers  how will her lovely quick eyes devour the history i send you methinks i see all her doubts her terrors her scruples her resolutions melt away as she advances in the perusal our benevolent edmund is transported with the conduct and success of his young ambassador and pronounces him fairly entitled to paradise from his various merits in this arduous trial the paradise we mean is the heart of your cornelia of which we call you the saint peter we beseech you therefore fair saint to throw open the blessed gate over which you preside and secure free admission to this meritorious aspirer  in sober serious truth my dear harriot we entreat you to make the most of the present glorious opportunity to strengthen the interest of this engaging seymour not only in the heart of cornelia where love and nature i fancy will sufficiently befriend him but in the less soft though amiable mind of your excellent husband  ah my dear harriot i cannot conceal from you the dread that torments me in the midst of our joy do not with the usual weakness of a wife betray me to my brother to whose endearing virtues be assured that my heart does full justice while i tremble for the possible consequence of his inflexible integrity you will understand what i mean believe me my dear sister we have both of us a thousand reasons for the most tender caution on this very delicate point  should your husband now oppose the union of seymour and cornelia from any motives of religious apprehension farewell not only to the future happiness of that interesting and deeply enamoured pair but farewell to that sweet peace and harmonious affection which has long prevailed so uncommonly and so delightfully among the different branches of our house i can perceive already that all the boasted philosophy of our tranquil edmund will not be sufficient to prevent his pride from resenting any opposition of the kind i have mentioned against the young friend to whom his heart is now acknowledging its recent and indelible obligation  a word to the wise though it comes from an affectionate simpleton may be of some use forgive me therefore my dear harriot if there is folly as i suspect there is in the gloominess of my fears and continue to love me for the warmth and sincerity of my affection  letter xxiii from mrs audley in answer to the preceding forgive you my dear tenderhearted monitor ask not forgiveness when you deserve the fondest thanks i have reproached myself a thousand times for the idle words  dropped in our hasty interview when i confided to you the charming packet of our cornelia your benevolent spirit has i find by the anxious kindness of your letter this moment received dwelt very seriously on those idle words after i bae you farewell i was apprehensive that you might do so your goodnature which is naturally alive and solicitous for your friends has acquired from the singular incidents of your life a pculiar degree of timidity where the happiness of those you love is concerned from this my dear girl and from my foolish jest by which i have added to the accidental bent of your tender mind you have harbored an idea very painful to your own friendly bosom and allow me to say a little injurious to a certain unblameable creature to whom among other infinite obligations i owe the great pleasure i feel in giving and receiving from you the name and affection of a sister  now do not say no nor think my dear lucy that i am talking to you with the usual weakness of a wife who cannot endure even a syllable that does but seem to find fault with her good man  you charge me not to betray you to your brother but my good girl what room is there for any species of treachery between parties who have in truth nething to hide as they have no designs or sensations toward each other but those of reciprocal affection however to show you that i am rather the loyal subject than the abject slave of my husband i shall observe your injunction and not impart to him your letter though believe me all the effect it could have upon him would be if that effect were possible to increase his affection for you let me now assure you most solemnly that in the main object o your apprehension there is nothing to be eared from our dear indulgent audley to convince you of my perfect sincerity on this point i will frankly say to you that if my good father stood in the post of my husband as cornelias trustee i should indeed be terrified for the destiny of the lovers aye lovers my dear i will not mince the matter lovers they are as we well know in reality though not yet declared so in form but though i question if ever nymph and swain were more passionately enamoured or in most points more suited to each other if my good father as i was saying had the guardianship of the lady the rigorous spirit of his religion would attempt i know and i dare say with success to annihilate the match the piety of my present and i may say to you my better lord though i really love my father is made of much gentler and more tolerant principles from my parents i learnt all the practices of devotion but it is from your brother alone my dear lucy that i have learnt i think the true essence of religion what is there that i might not learn from him except what his tenderness would sometimes wish to teach me because he thinks and i fear truly that i shall have occasion for it alas must i ever learn that bitterest of lessons how to bear his loss  but i am fallen imperceptibly into a tender melancholy illsuited to the time and very different from the strain in which i meant to fashion my infant reply to your affectionate letter haply for us both here are objects just here appearing in my sight to give a livelier turn to my thoughts i can just discern the graceful figure of cornelia on horseback at this moment approaching your favorite clump of trees this will be called to be sure a friendly visit to me  my dear dainty widow i am not blind to that solicitude with which you are now wishing to know if i have received a packet from italy  well that little scrupulous halfyielded and halfdefended heart shall be speedily thrown into new palpitations audley has met her and is walking home by her side i must put away my paper for the present my dear lucy but before i close it you shall have what i know you ardently wish to have a full history of the impression which the long and touching narrative of seymour may make on those to whom i now pant to impart it adieu for to day  let me now reecho to you your own lively words read read and rejoice my dear lucy trust me the interest of your young and powerful client is strengthened as much as you can wish in the two aweful courts of love and friendship what would i give that you could have been an ocular witness of the various emotions produced both in cornelia and your not inflexible brother by a recital of your enchanting dispatches from genoa that is a gratification we cannot have but as you are a dear good girl and i am eager to banish all your painful timidity i will give you as well as i can a brief and hast sketch of the cene  suppose our first salutation over and my lovely guest seated with lips that dared not in the presence of audley ask a single a question concerning seyr i saw and hastened to relieve the eude of her heart by saying to my two companions i have a great treat for you both i have just received a delightful history from genoa and as i have barely had time to skim it imperfectly we will secure ourselves from interruption and my dear audley will have the goodness to read it to us aloud cornelia gave me a look that seemed to say oh you barbarous creature why would not you indulge me with it alone but joyous curiosity soon triumphed over her momentary displeasure we prepared to listen with all our ears and my good man entered with his usual cheerfulness on the pleasant task i assigned to him he read with great spirit the honest exultation at the opening of the letter and not without remarking the graceful modesty of seymour you will readily suppose that i watched every instant the features of both my companions their first expression was that of simple unmixed joy in the perfect success of this charitable embassy as the history proceeded new and various emotions arose and showed themselves very visibly in the es that i watched i must not attempt to give you a very minute account of these as they would render my letter more voluminous than seymours but there were two or three striking incidents in the course of this reading that i must describe to you when audley came to  passage it is not i am persuaded in the power of nature to present any prospect to the eye so perfectly fascinating as the view of a lovely female heart under strong agitation he fixed his arch eyes on our lovely guest who sensible of his meaning turned instantly not ale with terror my dear but crimson deep crimson with conscious love audiey gave me a significant glance and to relieve our dear distressed friend began to read on without farther pause the description of the little giannina passing the old merchants door made us all smile but when my dear devout husband read the following exclamation how sweet and innocent are the illusions of affectionate piety he exclaimed with an expression of countenance between a frown and a smile ah seymour we must somehow convince you that true piety is so far from being full of illusions as you suppose it that it is the only thing which can separate illusion from human joy he added with an air of cordial friendship if we can but teach you this simple truth we shall very easily make you one of the happiest as you are certainly one of the most amiable men in the world another full blush and a half sigh here escaped from cornelia audley read on very generously without casting his eyes toward her when he came to seymours sudden languor and affecting discourse to the old merchant before he would accept his cordial cornelia and i burst into tears that we tried in vain to check your brother who is you know by nature used to the melting mood soon completed the weeping party he read and wept and wept and read till at last seizing the transported cornelia by the hand he exclaimed by heaven my dear widow it is impossible not to love this bewitching seymour the rogue has melted me into a woman and made me in love with him myself  there my dear lucy there is a charming specific for your fits of timidity now have i a great mind to throw down my pen and leave to dwell on those comfortable words yet i will not be so cruel to you as to suppress one circumstance which as my dear audley said to me when we were alone displayed to him at once the native modesty of cornelia and her rooted passion for seymour when my husband read the words my adored cornelia she did not as i maliciously expected start suddenly or blush at the sound of her own name so tenderly introduced in truth she did not believe those words existed in the letter pray admire this diffidence in our lovely friend as audley had rallied her a little on her supposed affection she concluded in the simplicity of her heart that he had sportively inserted this passage as a continuation of his rallery and she laughed at him in her turn for supposing her so credulous on his protesting his veracity and placing before her eye the identical words my adored cornelia written in fair and large characters her tears fell instantaneously on the paper i could not restrain myself from giving a voice to them and exclaiming in the words of the scarcely less simple and certainly not more enamoured mianda i am a fool to weep at what i am glad of   as soon as i had pronounced my wicked quotation i was ready to bite my tongue off for my poor friend was bitterly distressed and cast upon me an eye of heartwounding reproach but your brother who is you know the most exterous of beings in relieving the embarrassed soon put us into perfect good humor with ourselves and each other  in short we are now all harmony and hope take your full share of this joy my good girl and trust me if you continue to send us such dispatches from your interesting client you will have little reason to tremble for the final issue of his cause i wish i was sure of seeing you married as well on the day that unites him to cornelia do not insult these my good wishes dear lucy with a toss of supercilious virginity but if you pretend to doubt of their wisdom pray give me full credit for their kindness  accept our united love and believe me ever  your most faithful harriot  letter xxiv seymour to edmund audley with all your extensive speculation my dear philosopher on human characters you have never seen such a creature i am persuaded as giuliana and let me add that although you have studied this beautiful unique in scenes of solitude and of sorrow where you might imagine that all the finer mental folds would unveil themselves to your observation you are still unacquainted with half her perfections i have heard many a woman called an angel  i have seen and heard many look angelically and talk angelically  but i never beheld the absolute angel in female conduct till i saw giuliana repairing all the various evil which past events have produced in the house and bosom of her father how sublimely beautiful does a human creature appear who in the bloom of youth and with every personal attraction instead of being actuated by any selfish or perilous thought or passion has no design no idea no sensation but what originates and centers in the good of those friends whose peace and happiness she seems commissioned to superintend without any portion of their natural infirmities in truth giuliana now appears to me so much the angel that i should almost call it profaneness in any man to think of making her even a wife she is  i do not mean to speak with any foolish jocularity but in serious verity  she is too spiritual for such a department all the warm and halfwanton blood all the little amiable caprices which form you know the attractive essence of female character in a young modest woman all these that must have existed in the frame of giuliana seem to be refined into soul into mere intellectual benevolence the fact i am persuaded is that all her faculties and sensations are absorbed in her sublime and eternal passion for peverell it is the ambition of her heart and spirit to be united to that dear idol in paradise and her temperate enthusiasm persuades her that she will most effectually accomplish this great object by ministering to the temporal and to the celestial interest of her father whether she will succeed or not in raising the old merchant to heaven i shall not presume to determine but i may safely assert that she has rescued him from that earthly tartarus an illassorted marriage i have now passed eight very interesting and rapid days in their house it is utterly beyond my power to describe to you the exquisite address delicacy and spirit with which she has carried many important points in this period i must content myself with giving you the result of her influence in the first place she has acquired and exercised wih swe and becoming gentleness that ascendancy and dominion over the impetuous old man which a pure spirit has over a perverse one she has dientangled him in the most graceful manner from his matrimonial perplexity not by any abrupt opposition to the projected mtch but by teaching him to marry as our militiamen fight by a substitute it fortunately happened that a young distant relation of seignor pnelli was more enamoured than himself of this captivating and formidable widow giuliana with inexpressible dexterity persuaded her embarrassed father to become an advocate for the stronger and more seasonable passion of his young kinsman and to toss a little of his own superflous gold into the scale of his rival which he wished to preponderate against himself by this singular alliance between plutus and cupid the arduous affair has been happily settled in a manner to accommodate all parties i have still to relate to you another delightful instance of giulianas conciliating address and disinterested magnanimity she has negotiated and concluded a peace between some discordant branches of her fathers family she has even introduced into his house as his adopted son a very proposing and accomplished young man the child of his sister who having married to disoblige the highspirited pinelli had experienced his resentment in such a degree that he not only lived for many years without any intercourse with her conxons but indgnantly rejected her overtures of reconciliation on the death of her husband an event that happened while giuliana was in england such have been the domestic employments of our divine friend since her return you will easily conceive how i worship her and without any breach of my very different devotion to my no less adored and still more attractive cornelia who even in these busy days when i have been honorable employed as the nfidant of age and youth of the father and his child has not unfrequently been a subject of our animated conversation giuliana in the midst of arduous and intricate business has the happy talent of attending not only to her present but even to her most distant friends you and lucy will receive with this letter several very pleasing proofs of her grateful remembrance but you as i have just told her will join with me in reproving the sumptuous liberality of her gratitude we have had a vehement contest in a point of delicacy and honor in which she has subdued me completely both in words and actions in truth she invaded me on my weak side and therefore obtained a more rapid and decisive victory what think you she has insisted on doing would you believe that she has in a great measure taken from me the dear office of supplying the musical wants of my cornelia she will only allow me to send on my own account two favorite airs while she usurps the prerogative of dispatching as a present from herself to the lovely stranger an exquisite selection of vocal music i argued very furiously against the glaring impropriety and i added the barbarity of such a proceeding but my more eloquent ntagonist soon convinced my love of not my reason that the terms of reproach which i applied to her design were in truth only applicable to the opposition i made to it  what a sublime creature she is  how imperious in her humility  she has written a letter to cornelia i would almost give one of my hands for a perusal of it and yet here is barbarity to which even her eloquence cannot reconcile me yet i am not permitted to read or hear a syllable of her epistle  and i also must write to cornelia  write to her for the first time o delicious dreadful task how shall i accomplish it to my own satisfaction to my own i am persuaded it will hardly be possible i shall think at every word i write that i have said too little or too much how capricious are the human faculties now could i more easily scribble a volume to thee edmund critical as thou art on the most crabbed flt thou couldt propose to me than write ten easy elegant lines on a happy occasion to my candid cornelia it must however be done and speedily too so farewell my dear edmund tell lucy i hope to bring her home a husband that she cannot object to the newadopted brother of giuliana the young seignor morone i have not time to send her a portrait of him at present but i shall have sufficient opportunities to draw it for he is to have a little establishment at rome during the winter and as i think it most eligible for me not to return to england till the spring we are to keep house together and to be honored with a visit from the incomparable giuliana and her regenerated father o that you could escort cornelia for me to some roman temple of connubial juno but all in due time once more farewell  letter xxv from seymour to cornelia dear madam i find that to take an interest in your amusements it is not necessary to have had the happiness of seeing you i am almost ashamed to tell you that a person who never enjoyed that happiness has robbed me in a great degree of the honor and the delight that i proposed to myself in executing your musical commission the lady giuliana to whose very singular history and character you are no stranger has so forcibly pleaded for the gratification of sending you such a collection of music as she thinks may be most agreeable to you that i have been forced to suspend but not to relinquish my invaluable privilege of acting as your servant as a little memorial of my duty i take the liberty of adding to her judicious selection two favorite airs peculiarly expressive of maternal tenderness and happy indeed shall i think myself when i have the opportunity of hearing them from a certain voice which has the power of giving new delicacy and grace to the purest and most graceful sentiments of nature the language and music of this country are justly famous for speaking to the heart i feel that they do so yet allow me to say i am so true an englishman that highly entertained as i have been at genoa in hearing several of the italian songs now traveling to you i shall be much more delighted in hearing them from english lips  i am constrained to pass a great part of the approaching winter at rome and although my expedition to this country was certainly an act of choice and i have the greatest reason to exult in its success yet i feel that in so long an absence from england i must experience the pains of exile permit me to say that nothing can so effectually alleviate those pains as to be favored with a second commission from you as a proof that you forgive my imperfect execution of the first  accept the most ardent good wishes of my heart to yourself and the two lovely dear little heroic boys with whom i was vain enough to fancy myself a favorite  farewell and let me live in the hope that you will soon bestow the consolatory honor i have requested on  your most devoted servant  letter xxvi from edmund audley to henry seymour you are indeed my dear seymour the very prince of ambassadors no words can sufficiently express to you how much we rejoice in the success of your negotiation and how much we are enchanted by the admirable dexterity and spirit with which you have accomplished the great object of your wishes nor let me fail to praise and thank you as i ought for the felicity and kindness of your description which transports us to genoa and makes us absolutely your companions in every interesting scene we cannot satiate ourselves with repeated perusals of your delightful narrative and though we have twice read it regularly through together lucy and i are almost ready to quarrel for the separate sheets that each is eager to devour alone  tell the noble seignor and our divine giuliana that separated as we are by the ocean we see we hear we embrace you all every day and take a full share in those scenes of heartfelt delight which have arisen so happily my dear seymour from the admirable exertion of your talents and virtues i see how ardently the grateful the angelic giuliana will wish you to be rewarded i desire therefore that you will tell her in a whisper a piece of private intelligence that i am sure will add very considerably to her present satisfaction  tell her we have already a reward for you equal to her generous estimate of your merits yes you happy and meritorious favorite of the fair you will allow that i have not exaggerated the value of this reward when i bestowed it upon you in a word and assure you from indisputable authority that your adored cornelia doats upon her adorer nay doubt it a little if you please so much the better lest the excess of your joy conspiring with the native impetuosity of your spirit should render you absolutely frantic yet it is an honest truth that my gratitude in the present hour could not withhold from you though i confess my discretion or as you will call it my timidity suggested to me some reasons against indulging you completely with so important a secret  i now behold you ready to ask me a thousand questions in a moment patience dear ardent inamorato you shall know all you shall be told that the feeling the frank the generous cornelia has owned a passion for you to the friend of her bosom the compassionate harriot from whom the precious secret traveled through your very zealous advocate lucy to me to show you how completely i command this pleasant channel of intelligence i shall let you know that i have seen and that i admire your letter to cornelia you have ingeniously contrived to make violent love to her without saying a syllable on the subject indeed i greatly approve your caution and delicacy i did not observe a word that prudence herself in the weeds of a widow could possibly carp at your unaffected cornelia sent a copy of your letter to her confidante with an honest confession of the delight she received from it yet the dear dainty creature is resolved not to marry no you are too wicked magnanimous and engaging as you are and all other men are out of the question  but seriously my dearest seymour you must be very guarded in your behavior her heart and soul are your own if you will but avail yourself with prudence of the victory you have gained  as i send you such intelligence as will i know occasion a wild ferment in your veins let me cool them with a little icy admonition first i advise nay conjure you to remain as we wisely settled for you the whole winter in italy secondly be cautious i beseech you in your conduct there beware of all the wild frolicks to which your runaway spirits are so apt to betray you do not poison your blood by any gallant compliance with the wishes of an italian princess and pray when you are at rome let not your flaming abhorrence of superstition excite you to kick the whole college of cardinals out of the imperial city or to sacrifice the poor pope himself to the manes of your favorite brutus  it is hardly fair in me recently and inexpressibly indebted as i am to your ardent virtues thus to rally you for that impetuosity of spirit whose excesses i apprehend but you will read my love in my fears and my fears in my raillery  i have yet a million of things to say but i write at present in extreme haste to seize an unexpected opportunity of sending this to you by a private conveyance perhaps my second letter may reach you before the first which had nearly happened in the arrival of your two enchanting packets from genoa as they came to me within a few hours of each other i would not begin writing to you in return till i could tell you how graciously your delicate loveletter in dumb show had been received by your dainty idol because i knew that a letter which failed to tell you this must be of little or no value to so passionate a lover seriously my dearest friend you may hope and believe every thing you can wish in that quarter her heart as i have said is absolutely yours my brother as well as lucy and harriot is warmly your friend how can such a hero fail supported by such confederates in short you have not an enemy to encounter for heavens sake do not make one of yourself as that i am persuaded would be the only one we could not overcome still harping you find even in the midst of exultation on the string of timidity but how can i be perfectly free from apprehension when i know your indiscretion on a certain article is almost as great as my anxiety for your happiness laugh however as much as you please at my timidity if you will but cautiously adhere to the advice of  your most grateful and affectionate edmund  letter xxvii lucy audley to edmund sedley hall here i am dear brother as safely lodged in the noble and pleasant mansion of our cornelia as the prosperous seymour is effectually lodged in her heart there he is believe me and so perfectly has he made it his home his house his castle that you cannot tap at the door without seeing him at the window as often as i have had opportunities to speak in private to my lovely hostess the fascinating traveller has started up as the neverfailing subject of our conversation and more than once after the good tender scrupulous creature has desired halfsmiling and halfsighing that we might talk of him no more she has undesignedly introduced him herself ah love love what havoc do thou make in the memory senses judgment and all the bodily particles that form the composition of that poor weak creature called a woman but dear mr philosopher do not grow too proud in your solitude while you read this reflection for you know by woeful experience the case is not much better with you imperious lords of the creation how often has your own magisterial reason when guarded and graced by an orderly train of arguments and resolutions like a set of important constables attending the lord mayor how often i say has this masculine reason of yours with all its retinue been reduced to disappear like a poor skulking magistate in the tumults and conflagration of the metropolis yes my dear lecturer in philosophy this said love whether licentious or chaste is a terrible disturber of our peaceable faculties and as i by paying a heavy fine am released i hope from all future chance of wearing his burdensome though honorable chain i find an agreeable exercise and amusement in trying to lighten the yoke of this tyrant for my friends of either sex you have taught me to cherish the belief that i have done you great service both by tender consolation and ludicrous reproof i wish i may succeed as well in cornelias case which is directly opposite to yours you destroyed the peace of your life by having no scruples and she is a little disposed to produce the same effect by indulging too many alas if the rich the wise and the good find it so very difficult to make themselves easy how dismally restless must be the lives of the poor the weak and the wicked see what a moralizing creature you have made of a mere rattle by your habits of contemplation i have fallen you find already into grave reflections instead of giving you a lively description of this charming scenery and the pleasant day that introduced me here but you shall have it all as i am bound in gratitude to send you as long a letter as the dear solitary bachelor can wish to receive  first let me tell you as you have not been here for some years that this charming spot is a thousand times more beautiful than it was when we paid a visit together to our poor departed relation both the house and grounds which used to exhibit somewhat of his austerity and gloom appear to have caught the lively and der graces of cornelia the old fashionedsquare courts and the neverending series of stonesteps that made the whole garden one overgrown staircase are all vanished and instead of them you see nothing but nature embellished with true arcadian simplicity in short the place itself appears to me as a beautiful widow who has just got rid of an old burdensome husband called formality and is at once enlivened and softened by a new lover called taste  what a wicked and abominable simile is this heaven grant the ghost of my old cousin may not torment me for it but it struck my fancy so forcibly that i could not help throwing it into my letter to make you smile in your solitude  but to return to my own history my brother and harriot escorted me hither on thursday by their new private road which really saves a circuit of about    miles and notwithstanding all that harriot has repeatedly said in its praise it surprised and deligted me beyond my expectation in the first place the road itself is contrived with a most happy attention to picturesque beauty and secondly it exhibits a succession of the sweetest cottages that i ever beheld half of these you know were built by sedley and half by my brother and these two charitable landlords seem to have had an amicable contention which should produce the most pleasing and perfect specimens of rustic comfort content and cheerfulness every tenant of a cottage has a certain number of these private gates allotted to his care with some territorial rights and privileges for the maintenance of his family the most deserving characters in humble life were selected for these stations they all prosper and all together compose a succession of scenes that pleased me even to tears but you know i am an odd creature and often weep where other folk would smile and often laugh where they would be sad  harriot who is you know such a rare good wife as to delight more in a tribute paid to the benevolence of her husband than in any compliments to her own beauty or understanding was gratified in the extreme by the cordial admiration i expressed for this enchanting road which i begged leave to christen by the name of jacobs ladder as it seems to lead ultimately to heaven and its steps are covered with little cherubims my dear conductors having safely lodged me in this mansion which is perhaps as like heaven in the pury and beneficence of its inhabitants as any human habitation can be returned home again after dinner the day was a pleasant one in all points except in their speedy return our party at dinner was exactly to my fancy neither too large nor too small but most happily formed for agreeable conversation it consisted only of ourselves and two gentlemen whom seymour himself would think entitled to that name in spite of his antipathy to their coats their coats they were good but alas they were black for our two gentlemen were the minister of the parish and a very pleasing visiter of his an oxford sage extremely read in greek but as polite and gentle in his manners as if he had never heard a crabbed word in his life  cornelia has i think firstrate talents for conversation and she exerted them to our general delight not by engrossing a large portion of the discouse but by her skill in bringing every voice to its proper share in the concert it seldom answers to repeat conversation however sprightly and amusing yet i must tell you one remark that dropped from william and made a forcible impression on my mind the mild mr c who often acts as almoner to the charitable cornellia was paing her some just and delicate compliments on her success in relieving some piteous objects of her bounty and among them a poor woman the wife of an honest labourer who had like her husband been long remarkable for industry cheerfulness and goodnature but being betrayed by indisposition into dramdnking she grew by degrees so splenetic and malignant as to acquire in the neighborhood the appellation of the crazy woman in speaking of this unfortunate sufferer my brother said i believe madness has often this origin as benevolence and sobriety may be said to constitute in great measure the perfection of a rational being every deviation from either may be considered as an approach to insanity  whether this observation is philosophically and medically true or not i shall leave you my dear solitary philosopher to consider but it struck me forcibly in the moment i heard it and has since been a subject of my meditations you my dear speculatist are so severe as to think that no animals in the creation are so malevolent to their own species as woman to woman now if your bitter idea has any foundation we may at least set this malevolence in a pitiable though in a very humiliating point of view by ascribing it with my brother william to a want of vigor and soundness in the intellects of our sex for my part i am determined to profit by the remark i have resolved henceforth to say and to do all the goodnatured things that i can to all womankind for the sake of vindicating the health and dignity of the female understanding  i shall begin my new system of benevolence with our lovely widow by what my dear sarcastic edmund will call a rare instance of female friendship i mean by persuading her to make herself happy in serious truth you may depend on my being as warm an advocate for your friend as you can wish me to be but how little does he want a new advocate when love and music are at this moment stamping his image still deeper on the soft little heart sufficiently prepared to receive and retain it cornelia is delighted with the songs he has sent and seems never so happy as when she is singing them her powerful notes have just ascended to the chamber where i am writing and after so long a scrawl i am sure you will allow me to throw down my pen abruptly that i may hasten to catch more distinctly the sweet warbling of this amorous nightingale  will she continue to sing so delightfully if we put her as we so eagerly wish to do in a cage that is uncertain but this i know that i she is not put in the cage i allude to she will certainly sing if she sings at all with a thorn at her breast ala poor bird i meant to close with a little innocent laugh and am half read to cry pity the poor foolish lucy and believe me ever  your affectionate sister  letter xxviii edmund audley to seymour well my dear inamorato one of your passionate prayers is completely accomplished never was my poor friend peverell living or dead more vehemently idolized by the ardent guliana than you are by the timid the tender the melting cornelia it is so by all the powers of love if i know any thing of womans heart which i have studied in truth with sufficient application more years than you have your good friend the penetrating and zealous lucy has furnished me with a hundred proofs which you would have patience i suppose to peruse if they were set forth in a folio volume notwithstanding your dislike to a book of that size but as i presume you will give me credit without calling for such a mass of evidence i shall only mention at present one test of her affection for you that i am apprehensive you will think a little unpalatable and i would willingly assist you to relish and digest it she has resolved not to employ her own dear dainty fingers in writing any sort of answer to your ingenious loveletter here i see you stare and frown and protest that it is impossible that she must write to you that common politeness requires it with a thousand other protestations full of surprise disappointment anger spleen and love alas my dear friend i fear this rotation of turbulent sentiments is a necessary tax that all mortals must pay for their amorous delights however licentious or legitimate however gross or refined i have just paid the galling tax myself and feel it so heavy that i am almost on the point of relinquishing for ever what i can only hold by a tenure so tormenting a certain female whose capricious love for me is a secret to all the world but you has seized me since your departure beyond all description how often has she led me to repeat those truly poetic and truly philosophical lines of row on the sex  each motion of their heart rises to fury and love in their weak bosoms is a rage as terrible as hate and as destructive you will say perhaps of your more gentle widow she disclaims strife and her wrangling train of equal elements without one jarring atom was she formed and gentleness and joy make up her being   it may be so my good friend i confess she is of as soft and delicate a mould as i ever observed in a female but she is a woman and as such she will infallibly try the patience of her lover especially as she has one who can hardly reckon patience among the constitutional characteristics of his temper  but to return to the point whence i have sadly digressed her resolution not to write to you and the reason why you should contemplate that resolution with more pleasure than chagrin had she not loved you most assuredly you would have had a letter from her for i think as i know you do that she ought in courtesy to write so she ought in discretion but the most sensible and accomplished women perpetually overshoot their mark on this ground whenever they conceive a vehement affection they never fail to betray themselves at an early period of it by an excess of reserve cornelia however thinks she has a full excuse for not writing to you in the opportunity she has of conveying her thanks to you by her correspondence with the dear though unseen giuliana i own i would give something for a view of their singular and mysterious correspondence but even lucy who is treated with great confidence by your ingenuous though timid widow is not permitted to see a line and can only discover that giuliana has spoke of you with that friendly enthusiasm which your signal services have deserved pray tell that divine woman if she is really a woman and not a being of a higher class that i adore her more than ever as i am sure you must for this bold yet delicate method of expressing her gratitude to you i consider their correspondence as a striking omen in your favor but what omens can a lover want to inspire him with courage who has visible possession of the heart to which he aspires  i will only say therefore be confident be cautious and be happy  i know your active spirit will fret now because you have no commissions from your dulcinea or i should rather say your dido to employ you but i will take pity on you so far as to tell you an article she wants though i question if you can find it where you are she has a fancy for a beautiful and spirited yet gentle white steed with a full mane and tail in short such a palfrey as dido might have been proud to mount when she rode by the side of the trojan prince  now do not quit the hospitable roof of the noble seignor pinelli do not give up your projected residence at rome to plunge into those wilds of arabia where the most beautiful horses are to be found and where a horse as travelers tell us is brought to practice the most spirited and the most gentle of human virtues by being cherished as a friend and caressed as a child  i know your affectionate impetuosity is strong enough to lead you round the globe to gratify even a whim of the woman you adore and i really should not be surprised to receive a letter from you dated hejaz famous for horses of the most noble breed  remember however that the sarcastic monitor who has said so much to you against any precipitate addresses has allowed you to commence your siege in due form on the first appearance of that grand season for all amorous and warlike operations the spring so do not wander too far but wherever you may rove rest assured that the interest of your heart will not be neglected in this country and that you have a vigilant zealous and faithful agent in  your affectionate etc p s i hope giuliana has received a long letter from me with the best return i could make for her splendid present i should have said a great deal against the costliness of her kind remembrance had not affection induced me to sacrifice my own pride to the indulgence of her imperial gratitude she knows me well enough to be assured that the strongest proof i can possibly give of my entire regard is to accept without murmuring a gift of great value she is indeed as i have told her the only mortal existing who could exert such a despotic dominion over the most intractable of my feelings and make me cheerfully play the part of an asiatic slave bending under the weight and yet smiling at the splendour of unexpected and unmerited munificence    letter xxix seymour to edmund audley no my dear edmund i write to you not from arabia but from rome here is your impetuous friend but alas his impetuosity like that of rome is no more in truth i am as much reduced in spirit and as crestfallen as this poor old draggledtail queen of cities herself i am as much mortified and as splenetic as one of her paralytic yet ambitious cardinals who has just lost his animating prospect of the papal throne notwithstanding all the kind ingenuity of your friendship to soften my chagrin i am wretched under the uncivil and barbarous resolution of cornelia not to answer my letter shall i frankly confess to you how violently i was at first affected by her unexpected silence it inflamed my pride almost to frenzy and halfpalsied my love had the divine giuliana been accessible as a wife i should i believe in the instant have united my destiny to hers but i did not wound our exquisitely feeling and openhearted friend by any such proposal and this angelic creature has joined her efforts to yours in trying to persude me that i ought to consider an insult as a proof of affection alas my dear monitors how fallacious are your arguments do women hesitate to write when their passions are awakened no no to scribble when they really love is the first delight of their souls it is their passion even in infancy and their little fingers itch to scrawl a billetdoux before they can well hold a pen no it is plain enough her heart turns from me with abhorrence and for this i am indebted i suppose to some of her pious friends but they and she herself shall feel if i live that i am not to be insulted with impunity they may make me if they please an object of their hatred but never of their contempt  that you my dear sober friend may not think me too precipitate in my indignation i must tell you giuliana has had a second letter from cornelia and would not show me a line of it though i begged for the indulgence as if my very being depended on a perusal of that tormenting paper the friendly angel has vainly tried both to argue and to laugh away my resentment promising that if i behave well she will treat me with a whole paragraph from the next epistle but i will not allow even her charitable virtue and her enchanting spirit to jest away my very just indignaion and to act as a proxy for cornelia in making a fool of my heart  how fully have i experienced since i entered this city the truth of metastasios maxim that objects change their appearance according to the tranquillity or the tempest in our hearts when i paid my first visit to rome a very few years ago with what ardour did i ascend to the capitol my pulse seemed to beat with roman energy as i surveyed the monuments of roman magnificence and my soul caught fire in the recollection of those heroes whose virtues illuminated the scene around me it is not so now these ruins and palaces this strange mixture of debility and splendour only feeds my spleen and increases my melancholy yet i am pleased to wander alone among shattered columns and broken arches and find somewhat of soothing sympathy between grandeur in desolation and love in despair  i am just returned from sauntering and leaning a gloomy reverie against one of the three pillars that remain of the temple which that coldblooded coward augustus built to jupiter tonans on his narrow escape from a deadly flash of lightning and so stormy were my thoughts in this station that i almost wished to meet such a stroke of heavenly fire as the dastardly tyrant was so thankful for escaping  pray is it a proof of mans sociability or of his selfishness that when our own prospects are blasted we lose our lively interest in those of others the poor young seignor morone with whom i am quartered here in an excellent house is like other objects around me not a little overshadowed by the present gloom of my spirit i once talked you know of bringing him to england as a husband for lucy but pray tell her with my kindest good wishes i have relinquished the project and she must provide for herself morone is indeed a good and sensible young man but he is as unfit to relish the wit and sprightliness of your sister as i am to enjoy in my present humor the various delights of italy  our dear friends of genoa will be with us in about three weeks and then i hope you will receive a more cheerful packet from this mortified traveller whose spleen i fear you will now think immoderate but whatever excesses it may rise to be assured my dear edmund it can never overwhelm that affection with which i am  ever yours etc  letter xxx edmund audley to seymour you want indeed my dear seymour a mentor in your travels to guard you against yourself  believe me you have no other enemy and think me not too severe if i add you cannot have a worse i am seriously angry with you for being so barbarously unjust to the tender cornelia and so blind to your own advantages i am almost angry enough to punish you with cruelty nearly equal to your own and to withhold from you a piece of news that may prove a sovereign remedy for your spleen but if i did i believe your partizan lucy would think that i deserved like an ungrateful and inhuman tyrant to he cut off by a dose of domestic poison so in pure selfdefence i must inform you that your lovely opulent widow has been furiously attacked by a most formidable assailant and has defended herself with infinite spirit skill and success in plain english that i may not torture your flery imagination let me tell you her insinuating and splendid neighbor the peer has exerted all his abilities to secure the possession of her hand but with so little effect that he has now abandoned the enterprise in absolute despair there is a triumph for you that you little deserved in your late fit of querulous illhumour  now do not let your exultation be as unreasonable as your spleen for she does not reserve herself for you no you wicked humorist engaging and all accomplished as you are you are not good enough she says for a husband and as to all the other men in the world mercy on us there is not any one that is merely tolerable so for her part alas the poor hapless creature she is devoted to eternal widowhood  aye you happy rogue how will you make all these petty isicles that are so apt to hang on the retired and solitary heart of a truly delicate woman melt at your approach in the spring indulge not i beseech you any splenetic humor but dedicate all your feeling spirit to hope and love if your active and imperious fancy can torture itself in your situation what would it do in mine connected as i am with a wayward bewitching creature whom i can neither make happy nor relinquish and who has the art of tormenting both herself and me by an affection on which she might build if she possessed a more steady understanding the happiness of both yet perversely circumstanced as i am by the aid of a little optimistical philosophy i make myself tolerably contented i think every mortal should form for himself a sort or mental spyingglas looking through the magnifying end at all the good in his destiny and through the diminishing end at all the evil but the greater part of mankind do exactly the reverse and hence arises more than half the misery of human life hence the loud complaints in every age of the world against the general condition of our existence hence the innumerable invectives against woman the source of our most exquisite delights i have just had our friend merlon with me for a few days who is a thousand times more subject to spleen than you are and as he was also out of humor with his fairone he entertained me by inveighing against love with all the acrimony of a cynic i think said he with that sour vehemence which you can so well represent to yourself  i think sir isaac newton was not only the wisest but the happiest man that ever passed through the world because he kept his mind always amused by science and never allowed his heart to be tormented by a woman i encountered our moody friend as a champion for the sex and i replied notwithstanding my respect and my passion for science i can never suppose that the joys arising from intellectual pursuits are superior to those that belong to the affections do you imagine that newton in his sublimest discoveries felt a transport equal to that of a lover who having doubted the fidelity of a woman he adores finds her faithful and affectionate in the highest degree do you think that any author in publishing a most consummate and celebrated production can rejoice with an exultation so delicious as that of a father in happily completing the education of a son no my friend as nature chose to make a warm heart her prime minister for the management of her most important concerns she justly allotted to that minister the richest fund of delight  you i am sure my dear seymour would have taken my side of the question and who could have defended it so well even in the field of friendship without entering on that of love who could more properly decide on the joys arising from our affections and our faculties than a person to whom nature has given so much warmth in the first and so much quickness in the later your adventures at genoa would in my opinion determine the point for assuredly no man of the keenest intellect could feel such exquisite pleasure in a supposed or real discovery of the longitude as you felt in that happy scene which you so forcibly described to us  let the morose and the splenetic say what they please against human life it is surely a field more productive of enjoyments than of sufferings if cultivated by one who is careful to cherish the fruits and flowers and eradicate the brambles and the weeds it would be a paradise indeed if we could all make and constantly use such a mental spyingglass as i have mentioned yet had i a patent for making such i should hardly bestow one upon you for in truth you have only to see things exactly as they are to be convinced that your lot is singularly fortunate and i trust the unaided optics of nature are sufficient to make you clearly perceive the recesses of my heart and all the warmth and sincerity of  your most obliged and most affectionate friend p s lucy is still with your lovely widow and i should grievously lament her long absence if i did not prefer your interest to my own comfort  adieu    letter xxxi from henry seymour to edmund audley fear no more my kind philosophical monitor lest your too splenetic friend should torment and injure himself here is my good angel just arrived to enliven and protect me  here is our divine giuliana exerting her heavenly influence and diffusing peace and delight over every troubled spirit around her she has fulfilled her promise and indulged me though in truth i hardly deserved it with such a paragraph from the pen of my adored cornelia that all my proud suspicions and surly inquietude of soul are banished i trust for ever yes my dear adept in the abstruse science of woman your judgment in my favor is confirmed i am convinced that the heart of this delicate widow is as you have kindly told me my own for though she is too modest to make such a confession to giuliana yet every word in which she speaks of me is at once a graceful proof of her delicacy and a most enchanting indication of her love i feel this so strongly that my angelic governess finds it expedient to admonish me not to let my expectations of happiness run too high i believe indeed that i may now appear as much intoxicated with hope as i was lately exasperated by despair ah my dear philosopher what a restless scene of different tumults does the human bosom exhibit yet who would wish to live in perfect exemption from the tender tumultuous passion you and lucy perhaps in the profundity of your philosophical meditations but if so allow me to declare that i am not of your sect for my part i embrace the doctrine of that charming female saint of spain the warmhearted teresa who gave an incomparable definition of the devil in declaring him incapable of love but seriously my dear speculatist it is this passion alone which can render human life to my feelings a scene that i would wish to prolong i esteem the joys of friendship very highly yet i confes they are insufficient to maintain that harmony in my frame which is essential to its welfare my feelings perhaps are singular and romantic in a great degree i pretend not to say they are just what they ought to be but i tell you very truly what they are when i fancy myself not beloved my whole frame appears to me as a heavy awkward and useless statue of black marble but as soon as the rising beams of affection play upon it the dark mass begins to be animated like the famous statue of memnon at the rise of the sun every fiber seems to vibrate with harmony and joy such my dear edmund are my own sensations in the present moment yet i have certainly a striking example before me in our dear giuliana that it is possible for a being of exquisite sensibility to be contented i may almost say happy not only without possessing the enjoyments of love but in the absolute perasion of having relinquished them for ever yet it is not so for love is still predominant in this lovely creature her heart is with peverell in heaven and all her very tender and very successful attention to her delighted father is only a method adopted by her love to ensure her reunion with the prime idol of her soul she is happier perhaps in this idea than she could have been with the living lord of her heart there is a delicious and sublime tranquillity in a passion for the dead that can perhaps belong to no other affection at least this idea strikes me when i contemplate the present seraphic serenity of giuliana do not think however that i am desirous of consigning my lovely cornelia to the grave for the sake of loving her with a more intense and more tranquil ardour enthusiast as i am my extravagances are not so gloomy and i shall content myself with the hope of soon presenting to your contemplation two objects which i have heard your acute worship represent as the greatest rarities in the world i mean love unabated by fruition and friendship unimpaired by marriage  i have just made a pleasant compact with giuliana and her farther who is metamorphosed by his divine daughter into one of the most gentle generous and engaging characters that i ever met with you know i have a particular veneration for those rare old men who preserve with elegance of manners a warmth and tenderness of heart in the latter stages of life pinelli has now all these endearing qualities for his two predominant failings a love of money and a passion for importance are perfectly cured by his conviction that opulence and rank are of little value to that angelic child of his for whose sake he was once so solicitous to increase his consequence and his wealth giuliana has made him amiable and happy by annihilating his avarice and ambition his feelings are naturally strong he had no child but giuliana he loved her intensely and that love the main spring of his life after being painfully counteracted by indignation and resentment has at length recovered its force and freedom and enlarged the circle of its activity his past anger has given new energy to his present affection he not only loves his daughter better than he ever did but he seems to love me almost as much as if i were really her brother for having been under heaven and you the fortunate instrument of her restoration to his parental arms he flatters me on my talents such as they are he rallies me on my foibles and in short treats me exactly as a son very dear to him but in giving you this sketch of his regenerated character i have forgot to tell you our compact  it is briefly this if i marry cornelia oh that abominable if it chills my blood let me therefore say when i marry cornelia our friends of genoa are bound to visit me in england on the aniversary of my wedding provided i can assure them on my honor that in the course of the first half year i have not experienced a single splenetic hour if on the contrary i am reduced to confess that the rash humor which my mother gave me mad me forgetful i am bound as a gentle penance for my offenses to conduct my lovely wife to the distant residence of our friends to ensure the exact observance of this treaty you my dear edmund are appointed its guarantee but do not hastily conclude that i shall certainly incur the penalty of this amicable bond no i feel by the magic influence which a few syllables from the pen of my cornelia have already had on my bosom  i feel that a single embrace of that dear tender being will banish every particle of spleen from m frame for ever and you will see the happiest o mortals and the most affectionate of friends in  your faithful seymour  letter xxxii from the same to the same i now write to you my dear edmund not from arabia but from a spot which your sarcastic penetration could not foresee a chance of my visiting behold me on the banks of the tagus aye verily in lisbon and now i hear you exclaim what in the name of heaven could carry this strange eccentric fellow to portugal peace you will be satisfied when i answer charity and love the first has induced me to assist a poor a miserable wandering yet more than halfdead english invalid whom i met in italy attended only by two helpless women the second suggested to me that as the spring is approaching i could not do better than move to a scene from whence i may be conveyed by an easy voyage to that dear object who is soon i trust to settle the tranquillity and happiness of my future days at rome i chanced to catch a sight of my poor old valetudinarian acquaintance sir charles dawney reduced i think to the most deplorable sort of weakness that can fall on the mind and body of a feeble halfspirited mortal and literally dying of a rage to live his two good though ungraceful sisters who will soon be repaid by his ample fortune for a long and wretched attendance on this selfish skeleton have led him about from place to place just according to the whimsical dictates of his own querulous mutable sickly mind which instead of teaching him to expect and await the stroke of death like a man makes him crawl about like a whining child and foolishly seek by the most uncomfortable peregrination through various countries that health which no climate can possibly restore to him for my own part i confess his despicable and selfish avidity for life burdensome as it is to himself and his relations has annihilated my pity for his personal sufferings and had i been one of his sisters i should i believe have been more eager to send him across the styx than to convey him to the banks of the tagus but these good women have an inexhaustible fund of affectionate compassion they have charmed me by their indefatigable humanity and when the eldest informed me of her wish that she hardly knew how to accomplish of indulging her emaciated brother in his anxious fancy to pass the month of march at lisbon i like a true knight errant as you know i am immediately offered my services to escort them hither a dismal piece of work i have had of it but here we are and i have been rewarded for my trouble not by seeing the sick man revive or expire for he is neither better nor worse but by meeting accidentally with the very thing i wished to find for my cornelia a palfrey whose beauties surpass every thing that i ever beheld in the shape of a horse it is perfectly milkwhite with a mane and tail so full and brilliant that you might almost take them for threads of silver i have only one thing to fear that this exquisite animal may be rather too spirited for so gentle a rider as cornelia yet they assure me it has carried a lady and the master of it swore to me it was the property of a portuguese duchess lately deceased this i take for a mere jockeys story i have bought the horse however at a very high price and moreover two very fine useful horses for myself and your old friend robert who is appointed for life my master of the horse i have ordered a small vessel from falmouth to transport me and my cavalry to that port i mean to proceed immediately to my divine cornelia with my fourfooted offering and from sedleyhall i shall cross the country with all possible rapidity to you and i hope to be the messenger of my own triumph so pray tell my friend lucy if she hears your vigilant hector bark furiously after midnight she may dismiss her old apprehension of housebreakers and conclude the alarm to arise only from the rapid and riotous return of  your very sanguine and most affectionate seymour  letter xxxiii cornelia to lucy audley we are apprehensive my good tenderhearted girl that you will be frightened out of your wits by the hasty letter dispatched to you in the alarm of yesterday as i confess i was by the summons which brought me to the bedside of our dear harriot from whence i now write to you not i thank heaven to increase but to relieve you from your terror  she is sorely bruised indeed by the accident and there is reason to apprehend an event which may deprive me of the opportunity i expected of bestowing my fine roman name as you call it on a little miss audley but our invaluable friend has escaped miraculously considering the horrid circumstances of her overturn poor sally who concluded her mistress absolutely killed at the first sight of her desires me to say she was hardly in her senses when she sent off her letter to you and as to the honest postilion his sufferings i believe are the worst of all i do not mean in body though he has his full share of bruises but in mind the good creature absolutely puts himself to the torture for having been the innocent cause of mischief to the best lady in the world as he justly calls her harriot commissioned me just now to go and console him and if you had been with me we should have wept and laughed for an hour at the odd unaccountable and tragicomic expressions that poor daniel made use of to discover how far he was likely to be the means of diminishing the expected family of his master but i must not ramble from the main design of my letter which is to conjure you in the name of harriot and in my own not to think of flying hither at a time that we know it would be so very inconvenient to you especially as you have so very faithful and sympathetic a substitute in me to take all possible care of your sister she has determined with her usual magnanimity not to send audley any circumstantial account of this mischance lest his kind anxiety should hurry him back from ireland before the business that carried him thither can be brought to a conclusion  i have this moment had a private conference with our medical favorite mr brensil he is you know one of the most sensible soothing creatures in the world and he assures me there is nothing to fear for the life of our dear patient even if things take the worst turn they can but alas she may have some sharp sufferings to undergo and be some time confined at present though she is full of pain she has all her usual spirits and even her pleasantry as you will find by her first exclamation today when i entered her chamber in a newfashioned morning dress of white dimity so my dear attendant she cried this i suppose is a genoese and very becoming i protest ah lucy still harping on genoa you see  but i will positively throw down this abominable pen lest it force me to say more than i intend of that bewitching city which produces such admirable creatures a giuliana for as to any other person that genoa may contain  you may think what you please my dear but i can assure you  no you will only laugh at my protestations so i will assure you nothing but that i am my dear lucy  your very sincere and affectionate friend cornelia p s i have not told you that i arrived here late last night and i have sent home for various necessaries today intending to take up my abode in this house i shall dedicate myself entirely to our dear harriot and as it is proper that she should be kept quiet i have ordered my two dear little noisy chits to remain at home under the government of their incomparable nurse pray make yourself perfectly easy and confide in our sincerity and affection harriot is my partner in this petition and begs me to add that she will write to you very soon herself say every thing that is kind for us to your brother adieu    letter xxxiv seymour to edmund audley sedley hall yes from sedleyhall my dear edmund from a chamber adjoining to that of my adored cornelia i write to inform you of my arrival it is well i do not write as an honest irishman promised to do to tell you of my death for your knight errant has had a narrow escape of closing his adventures like a true hero of romance and literally pouring forth his lifeblood before the gates of his fairone behold me now in a state sufficiently romantic just carried into her castle in a very bloody condition with a ball lodged in my shoulder  i scrawl this billet to you in some haste more pain and still more delight for i am charmed with the incident that has thrown me into my present state though i must not yet attempt to give you any history of it i only lament that the blood i have lost was not shed in the defense of my dear widow herself instead of an humbler beauty in her train but more of this as soon as i can write with more ease as i cannot spare robert i send this off by an express lest that rapid rogue rumor who runs and magnifies every thing should get the start of my epistle and distress you with a report that your friend is shot dead  be not in the least alarmed i beseech you my dear edmund my life is perfectly secure my wound is this moment dressed by a very sensible pleasing fellow who has not plagued me with a single hard word in the whole operation he is one of us an honest enthusiast and he is so taken with the satisfaction i expressed in my exploit in spite of the blood it has cost me that we are become excellent friends in a short acquaintance of half an hour he is at this moment standing by me to see that i fulfill my promise to him of writing only a few lines for my animal spirits are in an odd sort of fluctuation between energy and weakness and he insists with the cordial warmth of a friend that i remain perfectly idle and quiet for several hours so i bid you farewell to fall into a delicious waking dream of my dear widows return for she is unluckily from home attending your sister harriot on a confounded miscarriage but the dear tender creature will i doubt not return tomorrow to visit the wounded champion of her castle and repay a thousand fold all the bodily anguish of  your smarting but fortunate and enraptured seymour p s dont you remember a promise i made to you of my widows very lovely luxuriant nurse she is the fair i have rescued from no vulgar ruffian so you see you lucky rogue that i have been fighting for you as well as for my queen my fingers burn to scribble the whole story to you but i am bound by a solemn promise not to attempt it tonight so god bless you    letter xxxv from the same to the same it is morning i have slept little but i can sleep no more and as i can contrive to scribble to you as i recline in bed without much increasing the pain of my wound i shall begin to write let my honest surgeon say what he pleases i am sure his good sense will allow that to render essential service to the body we ought first to make the mind easy and mine will not be so till i have given you the history which i have promised and which you i know will expect with the most affectionate impatience so fillets and bandages by your leave  i had a quick and pleasant passage from lisbon to falmouth landed my foreign steeds in excellent order and by a brisk march arrived about five oclock yesterday in fight of my lovely widows parkpale the faithful robert leading the white palfrey was a few miles behind me my intention was to find quarters for the night at the little inn on the extremity of the heath and to present both myself and the palfrey to my fair idol the next morning i was meditating how to manage my introduction in the most decent and graceful manner when just as i arrived at the first little private door leading from the park to the common and nearest the house a scene presented itself to me that i shall never forget as long as i exist the first object i saw was the youngest of the little sedleys standing still and roaring in an agony of infantine distress just beyond him his brother the little heroic william trying with all his might to disengage a large stone from the earth for what purpose do you think why truly to serve the noble little hero as offensive arms against an elderly but gigantic ruffian who at that moment had got his beautiful nurse in his grasp and was forcibly carrying her to a chaise that stood ready you will suppose that i instantly joined the conflict on the side of my most gallant little friend and confederate william who had actually drawn blood from the stout and barbarous fellow that had seized his nurse by throwing a sharp and heavy stone at his legs i made my attack on the opposite quarter and catching hold of his collar insisted on his releasing the woman being one of the most athletic men i ever saw and frantic with various passions he griped her fast in his left arm and threw me from him with his right he then asserted no very clear title to the beauty in question swore the jilt as he called her had promised to marry him and added another oath to announce a resolution of shooting any man who molested him in securing her person in the mean time the poor terrified female denied his assertions called him some harsh names which served to let me know my antagonist he is a man of no trifling note i assure you and with the most piercing supplication implored me to persevere in her rescue the gl does not want strength of body or mind she struggled hard to escape a general scuffle ensued in which i was lucky enough to set her free and to receive a large bullet through my breast into my shoulder  what passed immediately after this i cannot very well tell you as the force of the ball laid me flat on the field of battle but nurse who as she honestly confesses was not half so anxious for my life as she was to save her virginity for a man she loves nurse i say informs me that the moment she felt herself out of the clutches of the lascivious old monster you see by her expression women have no mercy on the amorous frenzy of an aged lover she ran without slopping till she got within the little door of the prk which as the key was fortunately left on the insie she was able to lock in an instant and thus narrowly escaped her impetuous and frantic pursuer not thinking herself even then in perfect security and seeing the gamekeeper at a distance whom the sound of the pistol had brought toward the scene of out adventure the poor frighted girl continued running till she placed herself under the protection of his gun with this guardian she had the humanity to return to my relief or rather i believe in quest of the poor deserted children how they supported their terrors heaven only knows the first thing that i can recollect is the rattle of a postchaise in my ears and the dear little william creeping up upon me rubbing my face and crying out seymour seymour you ant dead pray tell me you ant dead i wish to heaven i could give you a perfect idea of the wonderful spirit and affectionate endearing gestures of this brave little urchin he will hardly quit me a moment and the dear boy even petitioned to sleep in my chamber for fear he said i should want his assistance in the night o my adored cornelia how lovely art thou not only in thyself but in thy offspring exquisite beings that ye are when shall i have the transcendant happiness of saying you are all my own  but to proceed in my history when nurse arrived again at the gate with her new and wellarmed champion the enemy was not only flying but out of sight being foiled in his furious love and dreading the chance we suppose of being stopped for an assassin he had jumped into his post chaise and driven off with the utmost rapidity the rescued fair thus effectually delivered from her fears now exerted the most lively compassion and gratitude toward me it was no easy matter to convey me to the house for besides my wound which bled in a manner that terrified my two assistants i had somehow got a sprain which rendered me unable to walk as ill luck would have it the coachman and groom were out with their horses what was to be done fortunately for me the keeper recollected a little low gardenchair in which his poor deceased master used to be drawn by a servant to his favorite spots in the park in this i was soon seated and the honest fellow with my zealous friend william who insisted on having his little hand in the business drew me to the house faint and full of pain as i was i could not help smiling at the figure i made in this triumphal car followed by the beautiful and truly grateful damsel that i had rescued who carrying the youngest boy in her arms walked close behind me with the most touching solitude for the ease and safety of her deliverer i question it alexander or caesar ever enjoyed a triumphant procession so cordially as i did my vanity suggested to me that this incident would render me the hero and the idol of this mansion in truth all the domestics of it seem as eager to do me honor and service as vanity itself can desire a few hours will i hope convince me that their divine mistress is as sensibly affected as they are by my adventure and as eager to satisfy the ambition of my love  but i have not yet told you all the events of last night as soon as the men and horses came in the rogues had been gallanting their sweethearts to a distant fair one was dispatched for the nearest surgeon and another sent to inform his mistress that she had a wounded knight in her castle the last messenger fortunately met the surgeon whom i described to you last night a few miles from this house he is a most agreeable fellow and i believe at this moment under this roof for being high in favor with cornelia and a continual agent to her extensive charity he often sleeps here i find for the convenience of visiting the various poor patients of the neighborhood whom she consigns to his care it was his intention to do so last night he said before he heard of my accident he is a very penetrating as well as a pleasant fellow and has somehow or other picked up an idea that the lovely widow has honored me with her affection i intend to secure him very firmly in my interest and as i am situated at present i may find him a very useful ally he is a fine stout warmhearted son of aesculapius and lucina with a prolific little wife and multitudinous brood of children at home but neither household cares nor the wounds and maladies he has to cure seem to rob him of his peaceful morning slumber for though he promised to visit me early i have nor yet heard him stiring  you will begin to grow angry with me for keeping you so long ignorant of the formidable ravisher who was so near carrying off the luxuriant beauty that i once promised to send you like a rich gift of ancient heroic times poor edmund your chance is gone she is destined i hope to an humbler yet a your modesty will certainly confess to a more meritorious lover who has endured the most oppressive tyranny for her sake but her history if i can bring it to the conclusion that i have now set my heart on accomplishing to make this lovely persecuted creature as happy as she ought to be will form a delicious little romance and you shall have it entire i cannot however begin it at present for here comes my sweet boy my brave little william my earliest visiter to enquire after his wounded friend i have indeed scribbled till i am weary so adieu for some hours  seymour in continuation she is arrived she has been in my chamber she has been in my arms i have folded her to my heart with all the impassioned pressure of love hope supplication gratitude and rapture heavens what a moment i thought i was literally on the point of expiring with delight never did i touch in my life such a pair of lips to ravishingly sweet so transcendently voluptuous venus was a simpleton when she distilled her nectar upon them for she must have made them ten times sweeter than her own i could rave about them for hours giuliana indeed has a lovely mouth but her lips compared to my cornelias are like a stony pear compared to a melting peach had only ten drops of blood been lest in my shattered frame they must i think have boiled in my veins at the unequivocal symptoms of this lovely creatures affection oh edmund i never saw such expression before in the female face divine no language can describe the enchanting mixture of tenderness and of terror that her sweet impassioned features exhibited while i pressed her to my bosom but tenderness was the predominant sensation her very heart and soul seemed to dissolve in a chaste angelic exstacy while i protested with literal truth that it is my ardent wish to die of my present wound in her service if my life is not destined to be the source of her lasting happiness the tear of gratitude and of sympathy swelled in her sweet eyes and she suffered me to take such a kiss as would have overpaid the anguish of a hundred wounds such a kiss  you must not however profanely suppose that the dear divine creature has been any ways deficient either in discretion or in delicacy verily i think her conduct has been a model of both but i tell the story vilely and from an eagerness to acquaint you with my felicity i have jumped into the middle of my transports without relating any of the little incidents that conducted me to them  i will now endeavor to grow a little more sober in my narrative let me begin by informing you that my lovely hostess arrived here about noon and after a gentle message entered my chamber for the wounds that i have received both from mars and cupid conspire to keep me in bed brensil my surgeon was her gentleman usher and the dear brave little william her page i would give any sum for an exact sketch of her angelic countenance in the moment when her eye was first fixed on my poor pallid figure no painter i believe could do full justice to so consummate a model of compassion tenderness and beauty after a brief dialogue of concern and gratitude on her part and common gallantry on mine i gave a significant glance to my sensible surgeon whom i had seen before in the morning and he obligingly quitted my room with a promise of a speedy return in a few minutes i contrived to remove my little friend william on a trifling commission and forcibly detained the lovely mother who would have retreated with her son i told her what perhaps was very true that my life absolutely depended on her indulging me in a few moments of private conversation i had observed how deeply she was touched with pity at the first sight of me and as pity we know is a friend to love i resolved to make the most of this very favorable first impression  the moment we were alone i burst into the most explicit avowal of my passion the dear blushing creature would have stopped me by representing such a subject as peculiarly unfit for the time and conjured me to consult the reestablishment of my health by banishing all ideas that could agitate my mind i need not tell you my romantic reply to this friendly argument my incomparable cornelia who had been covered with a crimson confusion at the first declaration of my love now began to display not only great presence but great dignity of mind and she addressed me in the following manner with a composure and gentle firmness of spirit that struck me with new and aweful admiration do not distress me my very generous friend by saying things to which i cannot possibly listen without a very painful degree of selfreproach as you have just laid me under the greatest obligation let your generosity abstain from every thing that can look like taking an advantage or my gratitude believe me i am anxious in the highest degree for the preservation of your valuable life which you hazarded so nobly in the deliverance of a lovely woman who though her condition is humble has a mind of a superior cast and is endeared to me more as a friend than a domestic her history is singularly interesting you have preserved her from the basest of injuries and her gratitude is so ardent that if she knew your present address to me we should perhaps see her on her knees before me to wrest from me a promise which you say is essential to your recovery solicitous as i am for your safety and attached as i am to the grateful caroline it is possible that your joint entreaties might drive me to utter the words you require but reflect a moment my gallant friend what would your sensations be if you saw me embarrassed and made wretched by having hastily uttered a compassionate promise which my whole soul was deliberately desirous of retracting here i exclaimed oh my divine cornelia you shall promise nothing you shall be free as air yet love me for heavens sake love me or do not barbarously endeavor to prolong my existence in saying this i kissed her hand with the most tender vehemence and instead of withdrawing it from my passionate pressure she thus continued her discourse let not my great aversion to every thing that looks like prudery induce you my good seymour to misinterpret my intentions i should despise myself if i attempted to conceal from you that i am highly flattered by your partiality and that my heart is full of gratitude and esteem toward you it is i think incumbent on every woman or real delicacy to avoid all appearances of coquettish duplicity and fluctuating inclinations with those who have any claim to her regard for my own part it is my wish to treat you with all the tender frankness of a sister but in return for the openness with which i reveal to you the resolutions of my heart i must expect you to acquiesce in my sincere desire wound me not i conjure you with farther solicitation when i have told you as i do with the most perfect truth that i have seriously determined for the sake of my children never to think of marrying again  you will readily suppose that i combated this idea with every argument that reason nature and love could suggest in closing these variious pleas i said in a vehement peroration that if i obeyed her desire and silently acquiesced in such a resolution i should certainly deserve and probably undergo the bitterest of all punishments the punishment of seeing her torn from me for ever by a holder more intelligent and triumphant rival i then painted so forcibly the frantic agonies that i should endure from such a spectacle that i not only affected the dear tender creature but absolutely threw my own frame into a convulsion of horror she was touched and alarmed to a great degree for heavens sake tranquillize your spirits my dear seymour cried the compassionate angel think how cruel it would be to me when i am so very anxious for your recovery to destroy yourself by the mere phantoms of your own impetuous imagination i know it is very galling to a high spirit like yours to meet even a shadow of ingratitude where it has conferred the greatest obligation but indeed you shall never find me ungrateful and to convince you that i am not so i will now propose something to you that may i hope restore you to quiet and to health will you promise me to calm your agitated spirit and to drop this subject entirely till you are well if i assure you on my word of honor that you shall never see me united to any other man oh my angelic cornelia i exclaimed such an assurance in this moment would place my tortured spirit in paradise then i give it you most solemnly the dear angel replied extending her lovely hand toward me upon the conditions i have named  imagine to yourself my dear edmund my inexpressible transport in this touching this delicate proof of her affection i threw around her the only arm i can use and pressing her to my heart sealed our convention by that ecstatic  which i mentioned in the outset of my letter that kiss upon where sweetness i could yet write a folio but of which the most eloquent of writers would be utterly unable to give you an adequate description  when i had dwelt on her lips with the delightful avidity of a be just settled on the richest of flowers i released her from an embrace which from various reasons began to grow alarming and to show her with what punctilious honor i would adhere to the terms of her charitable treaty i began to talk on different yet still interesting topics first the health of my good unfortunate friend your sister harriot which i have the pleasure to tell you is very nearly reestablished secondly the very curious adventures of my rescued virgin the luxuriant the grateful the interesting caroline i long to tell you her story but i must still reserve it for a future letter i will not however close this without telling you a delightful touch of her gratitude to me which i have this moment learnt from brensil the intelligent creature suspecting that i was half frantic with impatience for an opportunity to make love to cornelia very ingeniously contrived not only to prevent the childs returning to me but to engage brensil also in some professional business that allowed me a much longer period for private conversation than i could have secured without her assistance my sagacious surgeon who has a most rapid eye in reading characters and motives of conduct saw through the grateful girls design and made her very honestly confess it he is a great favorite i find with all the women and i fancy an admirable proficient in female cases it is a rule with him he tells me to consider the heart as the prime fountain of health and sickness in more senses than one and he is very shy of giving medicine to his patients till he has somehow or other gained an insight into the state of their affections if my dear widow should call for his medical assistance i believe the rogue would be almost ready to pound me in his mortar and dispatch me to her in the shape of a bolus so convinced is he that i am the only specific for any complaints to which her lovely frame can at present be subject having told you his system i leave you to guess if i did not follow the precept of my bible and honor my physician with the honor due unto him pray observe how religious i am growing but i must say goodnight for i can write no longer yet i have not told you that my divine cornelia indulged her children and me in a request we made and graciously took part of a little repast with them in my chamber after which she departed immediately to resume the care of your sister but in departing she gave me such a deliciously tender adieu that i could wish to do nothing but dream of it till i see her again in that hope i bid you once more and for the last time goodnight  i cannot throw down my pen without entreating you to dismiss all the friendly anxiety that i know you and lucy will feel concerning my wound i am anxious lest it should be healed too soon and oblige me to quit this mansion of bliss for too long an interval before i can make the lovely mistress of it my own surely she cannot persist in the terrific resolution she mentioned ah my blood curdles at the bare supposition pray my dear edmund meditate on every expedient that you think likely to make her mine and to accelerate an event so essential  he wellbeing of  your most affectionate seymour i break the seal of this packet to say that my express is just returned with your most friendly billet i grieve that you are ill and conjure you not to think of coming hither i insist on paying you the first visit adieu    letter xxxvi from edmund audley to seymour my dearest of friends i am so painfully surprised by the kind account or your horrible adventure that i hardly know what to do or to say had your messenger not found me confined by indisposition i had infallibly hurried to you immediately for i know your gallant spirit makes too light of every danger and i am wretchedly apprehensive that your wound may be much more serious than you represent it in the name of love and friendship i conjure you not to trifle with a life so valuable consider you are on the point of obtaining the fondest wish of your heart and have before you as fair a prospect of your happiness as the world can exhibit do not i entreat you sacrifice all to any unseasonable contempt of danger if your surgeon is in any degree alarmed by your case i conjure you to send instantly to london for the best advice i know that if you are not already more than half dead you will laugh abominably at my apprehensions i allow you to do so but the perpetual monitor must remind you that your disdain of fear which stands high among your numerous virtues sometimes passes the line and shows itself in the petty groupe of your foibles remember popes lord peterborough the bravest man of his time used to say show me real danger and i will show you real fear  however if you are really safe and heaven grant you may be so i will rejoice with you in the glorious opportunity that fortune has so propitiously given you of displaying your heroism in the eyes of your goddess that she may soon reward you for your valor as thetis and other chaste goddesses rewarded their heroes of old is the fervent prayer of  your anxious and affectionate edmund p s i have had a smart fever but lucy has almost nursed me into health again she would be very happy to render the same good office to you and we should very soon i believe set out together for that purpose if we did not conclude on a minutes reflection that you might for certain reasons heartily wish us at a distance tell us frankly your feelings on this point and i beseech you do not fail to give us full and speedy intelligence    letter xxxvii mrs audley to lucy bless us all my dear lucy what a hurlyburly of casualties sickness and sorrow we have had among us but thank heaven our prospect is growing bright again in every quarter  to begin with myself you will i know rejoice to hear that i am once more on my legs nor will it afflict you to be informed that i am going to make a charitable use of the liberty i have just regained and to attend our dear widow in her second visit to the brave wounded knight in her castle there is spirit and enterprise for you my dear romantic girl there is a bleeding lover ready made by fortune for your pen to celebrate just as your own fancy would make one according to the true pattern of good old romance if you are disposed to exercise your genius in painting impassioned scenes from the life you must quit the pensive philosophical bachelor and take your abode with us for ours you find is the region of adventure well it is a great blessing that we can now laugh at the wounds of our young champion which threw us all at first into a terrible consternation edmund and you i suppose have had a full history from himself of all that befell him he may have described to you the delightful visit of his lady hostess ah my dear lucy what a visit was that for the accomplishment of our wishes the whole business is done my dear you may begin to work the bridal shoes you talked of presenting to her would you believe it the dear scrupulous creature was alone with him for an hour in his chamber dreadful indiscretion she exclaimed in confessing it mercy upon us cried i it is well this tremendous hero had one arm disabled but her gentle frank heart was so open in its confessions she came back to me with an agitated bosom so full of pity gratitude and of love that i could not bear to rally her long besides i was i confess very impatient to know as you will be if you do not know it already what matrimonial advances our hero had made in so favorable an interview and what concessions he had obtained from our lovely scrupulous friend no trifling one i can assure you she has promised him never to marry another man the lover has who induced his mistress to give up for him all the rest of his sex must be a weak pleader indeed if he does not proceed a little farther in his argument and at last prevail on the fairone to make him a present or herself  you and i my dear lucy may now i think set our hearts at rest on this match it is a favorite point with both of us and a point that fortune seems as eager to accomphlish as we are i expect my dear audley at home again in a few days i need not tell you with what affectionate impatience my father who had heard of my late accident is coming with him it gives me particular delight that i shall present your favorite seymour to them both with such an accumulation of honor on his head he has not only endeared himself to us women by his courage in this adventure but he is just now very generously exerting his interest to redress all the wrongs of poor carolines persecuted lover could you have thought that the old admiral would have shown himself such a frantic brute what horrid imperious creatures men are apt to be because this rough veteran has shed his blood very freely they say in the service of his country he thought himself entitled to make as free as he pleased with the chastity of her daughters but his outrage to caroline is rendered doubly detestable by his base oppression of his young favored rival who however inferior to him in rank is certainly from what i have learned of his sufferings more truly brave than himself if seymour can accomplish his generous project of uniting this very handsome and cruelly injured couple he may i think command the service of all honest lovers throughout the world as to poor caroline who is yon know a sweet grateful creature she i find perfectly worships him already so if cornelia should affect to be inexorably cruel which is not i think very probable she must be driven into wedlock by a general persecution from her own sex in which i know the voice of the dear zealous lucy will be as loud as that of  her affectionate harriot  letter xxxviii seymour to edmund audley as i think an interesting lovestory no bad medicine my dear edmund to inspirit the imgination of a sick philosopher and as i have nothing new to tell you in the progress of my own passion i devote this paper to the promised account of my humble yet lovely ward the very grateful caroline i heartily wish you could have the high pleasure that i have had i mean the pleasure of hearing this little story most admirably told by the eloquent lips of thankful simplicity but as i have laid you under an injunction not to hasten to the house where caroline is to be heard i shall exercise as well as can for your amusement the agreeable office of her historian if i may trust my own feelings in listening to her narrative the adventures of few beauties are more worthy of being recorded  i hardly know where to begin my history because i imagine that your lively intelligent sister who never lets an interesting tender story escape her must have heard from cornelia and probably communicated to you many particulars relating to this captivating girl yet as that may not be the case i shall briefly tell you the first incidents of her singular life caroline southcote is the daughter of an honest and jovial farmer who living with more hospitality than discretion left a widow embarrassed in circumstances and overburthened with a numerous family it happened that the squire of their parish had a brother settled abroad as a consul in spain who marrying a spanish lady requested his brother to send him over a young english girl to attend on his wife the lot fell on caroline whole merit and situation outweighed her want of age and experience she was a mere child when she was sent into this foreign service but a very few years converted her into such a woman as might inflame to madness the warm blood of a spanish cavalier she escaped however the gallantry of spain to be more roughly and i hope in time more tenderly handled by a british tar for the two objects of her abhorrence and her idolatry are sailors just as she reached the delightful age of nineteen in the full bloom of beauty by its nature luxuriant and rendered still so perhaps by the climate in which it expanded at this critical season of her life the master of caroline was obliged by ill health to revisit his native country his amiable spanish wife embarked with him attended by the lovely girl whom as the good lady had produced no children she ever treated more as her child than her servant they sailed from gibraltar in an english man of war commanded by an admiral whose name is well known to you as he has often signalized his courage in the public service this warrior though he is like othello declined into the vale of years retains like the moor all his keen appetite for beauty and i may add for revenge he was deeply enamoured at the first sight of caroline and never i must say was a composition molded by nature more likely to set a veteran on fire the admiral exerted all the advantages of his situation in trying to gratify his desire but he found that the lovely girl was impregnable and having never perhaps met with a repulse before either in love or war he began to speculate on the latent cause of this unusual and unpleasant event the searching eye of authority and suspicion soon discovered the source of this mortifying failure the tender and open heart of the tempting damsel was preoccupied by a younger assailant she had entered the vessel with a bosom well prepared by nature for all the ardour and firmnes of genuine and honorable love and chance recommended to her favor a fine young fellow who has proved himself i think completely worthy of her passionate attachment but unfortunately for all parties this favored youth is peculiarly dependent on his old and ungenerous rival he is a brave lad of humble birth but with the advantage of having received a tolerable though cheap education in one of the northern counties his friends had placed him under the patronage of the admiral who had freely promised and had sincerely intended to make his fortune he had only rated him as a common sailor in his ship but constantly employed him as his secretary an office he executed with great intelligence and in which he had not lost opportunities of signalizing his courage by his sense spirit and affectionate alacrity he had made himself the prime favorite of the admiral in a post so exposed to envy and ill will the engaging manners of edward monson still rendered him universally beloved so far was he from being deemed unworthy of the high favor he possessed that many persons thought him entitled to superior rank and supposed but erroneously from his having the graceful air of a gentleman and an officer that he was the natural son of his patron in the eyes of the tender and discerning caroline he seemed worthy of the highest distinction and she soon give him what he probably thought superior to all naval honors the full possession of her virgin heart the most exquisite enjoyments are generally loaded with immoderate taxes and destiny mingled for poor monson a cup of honey and gall as soon as the mortified old admiral discovered the amorous triumph of his secretary all his splenetic soul was possessed by the demons of jealousy hatred and revenge he was converted at once from a generous patron into a merciless tyrant and implacable persecutor his station gave him every advantage against his defenseless young rival that a base passion could wish and he exerted these advantages with a mean ferocity disgraceful to human nature under frivolous or false pretenses he condemned the oncefavoured monson now the object of his abhorrence and his envy to corporal punishment and rigorous confinement the tender caroline in reaching her native land where she had fondly promised herself the full enjoyment of liberty and love was reduced to the misery of leaving the man she adored secluded from her sight and suffering that ruthless oppression which his attachment to her had occasioned  i never was more affected in my life than by the touching description which the charming girl gave me of her extreme agony in quitting the ship where her lover was imprisoned she was obliged to fellow the fortunes of her sick master and her foreign mistress they both died within a twelvemonth from the time of their reaching england and a providential series of incidents threw the desolate caroline into the service or i should rather say under the protection of my tenderhearted cornelia the cruel and furious old admiral has had in the mean time the infernal gratification of persecuting his helpless rival during a long and distant cruize from which he is lately returned poor monson still continues his slave and his captive but i have already taken some measures to restore the brave lad to freedom and i hope soon to enliven you with an account of their success i can only add to this letter a few more particulars that relate to this interesting girl upon my asking her if her persecuted lover did not contrive to write to her after she landed o yes she replied with an impassioned simplicity nothing but his precious letters could have kept me alive and he has a faithful friend in a young lieutenant of his ship who was so good as to send me his letters by every possible opportunity may i my good caroline said i in return may i without impertinence ask to see one loveletter from this brave injured lad whom you have taught me to esteem and will you have the goodness to show me the very letter i will ask only for one which you perused with most pleasure dear sir replied the grateful caroline after all you have done and suffered to save me from that barbarous old ruffian i should be a thankless wretch indeed to refue you such a request at there words she slipped her finger and thumb within the folds of a thick muslin handkerchief and pulled from her bosom a neat little ae of blue satin which was suspended from her neck by a very narrow ribband of the same color here said she with a deep sigh here is one letter of my poor edward tha i think it my duty to wear upon my heart both by day and night that i may retain the fuller sense of all his sufferings for me and constantly pray to god to bless me with the opportunity of making him all the amends that fidelity and affection can make you may read this sir she continued but i should tell you the old barbarian only kept him in close confinement while my master and mistress were on board his ship but after we landed he was wicked enough to have him inhumanly whipped before the mast you will see how bravely he bore it she added dropping a tear as she entrusted the letter on my hand  i received with eagerness this highly valued epistle which had been unfolded so often that it was almost in pieces poor edward is in my opinion much more of a true hero than his base commander  the brave fellows letter pleased me so much that i could not help perusing it several times and i will try if i cannot give you from memory a literal copy of it i believe it runs exactly thus  my sweet carry i had rather you should hear from my own hand than from any other quarter that i have just endured the basest outrage that man can undergo from the old jealous and revengeful tyrant how would your soft heart have shrunk within your bosom in hearing the lashes that have mangled the body of your beloved edward i thank the brute however for abstaining from this iniquity while you were on board for now my sufferings are nothing in comparison of what i should have then felt for you i have smarted indeed and my flesh still trembles with pain but my heart triumphs in the cause of my punishment for in truth i am guilty of no crime but my love to you and this is more increased than subdued by what i endure i almost pity the vain fury of the old mortified inquisitor for not perceiving that every lash which he inflicts on my body carries with it a delightul assurance to my soul that he is detested and that i am beloved by the loveliest woman in the world oh my generous my adored caroline i am convinced that the wrongs i suffer will increase your attachment to me and i therefore esteem them as an invaluable blessing fear not my fainting under oppression because my fortitude is supported by my confidence in your fidelity your purity my angelic girl and my patience will i am sure continue to foil the base passions of our persecutor and may deride the impotence both of his lust and his revenge  write to me immediately i conjure you under cover to that generous friend who delivered to me your inestimable billet on the day you landed it was that blessed billet which inspired me with all the patient fortitude my injuries have required write to me my dear girl for your letters will be the most soothing of medicines to this raw and smarting body they will at least banish every sense of pain from the heart and soul of  your most faithful edward   there is tenderness and heroism for you in a lad of humble birth the beautiful caroline perftly understands the real value of such a lover i i can be fortunate enough as i hope i may to redress their grievances and unie this handsome deserving couple what a charming scene of exultation we shall have i have written to the admiral who though he has long been under the malignant influence of two frantic passions has the credit of having done several brave and generous things in his life i never chanced to meet with him before but i have heard he was intimate with my father when they were both young men this circumstance tempted me to write to him i expect his reply with singular impatience when it arrives you shall see both the letters if his aner does not satisfy me i have resolved to make a vehement application to the board of admiralty as i have a friend among them who will i know be ready to assist me in rescuing this brave injured lad from such malevolent opppression adieu wish me success in all the multitudinous concerns of love that i have now on my hands and believe me with every kind wish to you and lucy  your affectionate seymour p s you will be no longer anxious concerning my wound when i inform you that i have almost quarrelled with my surgeon for not giving it a more formidable appearance the saucy pleasant fellow replied that i have no occasion to descend to the artifice of a beggar and attempt by fictitious maladies to work on the tenderness of the widow i command he says without the aid of sickness all the compassionate movements of her heart  agreeable flattery    letter xxxix from mrs audley to lucy sedleyhall joy joy my dear lucy let me pour into your sympathetic bosom some portion of that overflowing joy in which every creature of this seems to be almost overwhelmed how frequently and fervently do i wish you were with us that you might completely share the tender jubilee that now reigns in this mansion where every wall seems to reecho the triumphant sounds  none but the brave deserve the fair let not your quick imagination however conclude from this burden of our song that your friend seymour is married to cornelia the sprightly words of dryden are certainly applicable to them but at present they are applied more directly to a happy pair of inferior station in whose transports you will take an interest as lively as i do and the more so as their happiness is the noble work of seymour how you would have wept with delight my good tenderhearted girl had you seen what we have seen  but i will give you a brief history of the last delightful three days on tuesday i was made happy by the return of my dear audley accompanied by my father both in high health and spirits my joy at the sight of them was increased not a little by the affectionate encomiums which they both bestowed on my conduct during the absence of my lord as he you know is always peculiarly alert in the service of his friends he resolved to set out the next morning on a visit to the wounded seymour and after a little gentle raillery on our tender widow he settled it for us all to remove to her mansion and thus assist her with due decorum in paying those attentions to the champion of her castle which she certainly wishes to pay i thought i discovered that the dear dainty creature was halfpleased and halfembarrassed by the first sound of this project but she acded to it very cordially we all arrived here yesterday about noon and had the comfort of finding our wounded hero just in that state which renders him peculiarly interesting without giving us any alarm for his life as he was not permitted to dine with us our little party at the request of my good audley paid him the compliment of drinking tea with him in his own apartment what a zest does a little mixture of pity give both to love and to friendship i confess for my own part that i never thought this agreeable fellow half so engaging as in his present palld condition and as to our poor crnelia she had such inexpressible tenderness in her countenance while she listened to the various history which our hero gave us of his adventures that i conceive the sof widow of carthage to have een an absolute slnt to her in serious truth my dear girl we were all charmed with our evening and seymour related the late interesting occurrences in which he ha had so important a part with such spirit grace and even modesty that we could all i believe ve listened to him with pleasure during the whle course of the night had not some  the ival in hi countenance and at last in his voice given us a signal to retire  you will guess how happy i was in this evening when i tell you that my father whom i was you know particularly anxious to prepossess in his favor declared after we had quitted his room that seymour exceeded all that i had said in his praise and is the most captivating young man that he ever beheld you my dear lucy are not inclined to contradict this encomium but if you were so you would still i believe subscribe to it after hearing the account that i have yet to give you of this morning the period of our highest delight and exultation  as my father had not seen the late improvements in this charming spot he and audley breakfasted very early together and immediately after it sallied forth for a long ride cornelia under the guard of your humble servant and her eldest son ventured to place her breakfasttable in the apartment of the wounded knight who had petitioned most eagerly for this indulgence in a few minutes after the teathings were sent out and while seymour was ingeniously holding us his captives as it were by a fascinating description of some incidents at genoa and the filial virtues of giuliana we were surprised by the hasty entrance of caroline she appeared with a wild april face full of smiles and tears and instead of apologizing for her intrusion exclaimed here he is sir and cannot rest without the liberty of blessing our noble delive as she uttered these words a fine maral young figure advanced and throwing himself nstantly on one knee by the side of the bed at whose feet cornelia and i were standing he seized and kissed the hand of seymour but in attempting to speak burst into tears my brave monson cried seymour with a joyful quickness you are of all men living the man i most wished to see but do i see you perfectly free have you got your discharge the stranger could not reply but continued to kneel and press the hand he held in an agony of gratitude rise rise my good friend said seymour who began to be much affected you over rate my little services good heaven cried the lover of caroline starting up is it possible for any human being to owe more to another than i owe to you no sir my whole life devoted to your service could not thank you sufficiently to you alone i am indebted for my liberty and a blessing far dearer than liberty itself i am indebted to you for the preervation of this lovely this faithful this unsducible woman at these words he folded carolne to his heart who instead of being rendered bashful by our presence returned his embrace with all the tender dignity of innocence in paradise surely there is no sight more touching and pathetic than the meeting of two such meritorious beings long separated by persecution and suddenly elevated to supreme felicity in being restored to each other the scene melted us all into silent tears and seymour wept as plentifully as your humble servant or even the more tenderhearted cornelia herself but he made the first effort to subdue his emotion and said with a pleasant vivacity to monson well my good friend since the old admiral has behaved handsomely at last we will forgive him for all the pain he has made us undergo he is a gallant fellow and it is no little proof of his heroism let me tell you that he has spirit enough to send such a fine lad as you are to the beautiful girl whom he would willingly give his whole fortune to possess but what said he to my letter o i ask your pardon said the happy bewildered monson here is his answer he now delivered an epistle to seymour which cornelia and i confessed a most ardent curiosity to peruse but our hero who had i suppose some private reasons for not gratifying our visible wishes on this point soon gave us a much higher gratification by showing us what his princely spirit had for some time projected to complete the happiness of this interesting couple desiring cornelia to give him his pocketbook which had been laid on the mantlepiece he said as he opened it my dear monson though your grateful spirit thinks itself highly obliged to me yet in fact if my zeal to serve you stopped here i may have done you perhaps more harm than good for by obtaining your discharge i have certainly taken you from a noble profession and left you without the means of subsistence it is a duty that i owe both to you and to our country whom i have robbed of a gallant sailor to provide for you in some other line and render you a useful and happy member of society i am perfectly acquainted with your circumstances and your resolution to marry the truly deserving caroline as soon as fortune enables you to do so passion and prudence conspire for once to second your wishes i think in point of discretion you cannot marry too soon not so much to secure your bride whose fidelity neither fraud nor force can subdue but to prevent this odd furious old man whose peace and honor we would both with to consult from relapsing into his amorous frenzy let me advise you therefore as a friend to marry immediately and that my advice may not appear more an insult than a kindness you must allow me to furnish you with this immediate provision till we can find an opportunity of settling you in some eligible employment  after this friendly and delicate address to prepare the young stranger for what might oppress him seymour gave him a paper and what think you my dear lucy it contained you will hardly guess though you i believe were the first my dear girl who distinguished our hero by the title of the princely seymour not to put your curiosity on the rack i will instantly tell you it was a draft for a thousand pounds i shall never forget the face of monson in the moment he perceived its value astonishment gratitude pain and even indignation were all visible in his features no sir exclaimed the highspited youth though i adore you for your generosity i must not receive it i will appeal to these excellent ladies if i should not render myself utterly unworthy of those invaluable benefits you have already conferred upon me if i acceped such an immense pecuniary obligation from any man without the shadow of deserving it at these words he held the paper toward me you will guess that i caught it with no little eagerness and he added with a supplicating and distressed countenance teach me dear madam how i ought to behave toward so noble so disinterested a friend you are quite mistaken my good monson cried seymour i am so far from being a disinterested friend to you that in this business i am the most interested being imaginable i will convince you in a moment that you will confer a much higher obligation upon me by accepting this sum that i can upon you in bestowing it i wish you well indeed on your own account but i most honestly confess to you that i have another and a much stronger motive for supplying you with this immediate provision it is to gratify this lady whose kind heart is deeply interested in the settlement of caroline and by yielding to me an opportunity of pleasing her you will confer an obligation upon me beyond the extent of my whole fortune and my fortune in truth is such that i shall not feel the slightest inconvenience in parting with a sum which by being applied to your immediate use may make us all happy while seymour was saying this he pointed to cornelia whom monson had hardly observed before but he now locked in her face with an arch yet modst smile that lovely face was covered with one of the deepest blushes that i ever beheld on perceiving this i said to caroline who had stood weeping and smiling alternately at my side come my good girl take and discipline your charming lover in private i must play the schoolmistress here the happy damsel and her gallant sailor instantly withdrew a tender and delicate contest then arose between the wounded knight and the more deeply wounded widow concerning the share each should take in providing for this lovely couple who are at all events to be speedily married  i who am you know an admirable oeconomist in saving the money of my friends have i think settled the business very ingeniously without any great expense on either side my proposal is to marry them immediately for i am ever you know a staunch friend to hymen and let them act directly as governor and governess to the children of this house and of ours this plan will succeed if it has the deliberate sanction of my husband with whom i am to talk it over at our leisure at present we are all too much exhilarated by the joyous arrival of monson to debate any point very seriously  cornelia who is at my elbow and who by the way looks more beautiful to day than she ever dd in her life will not allow me to scribble a moment longer here is indeed a grand packet already and my husband writes also to our dear bachelor so pardon an abrupt adieu after a history of such comfort and joy and believe me my dear lucy  ever your affectionate sister  letter xl from mr audley to edmund audley it is with peculiar delight my dear edmund that i send you such intelligence of your friend as i know will be most welcome to your affectionate heart and operate as the most animating of cordials on your reviving health  the brave the generous the engaging seymour is in truth as great a favorite with us all as you can wish him to be he is admired by one sex and idolized by the other as to my lovely ward of all the modest enamoured women that i have happened to meet with she is by many degrees the most deeply impassioned i never saw the emotions of genuine love so completely visible in a reserved and delicate character i have studied her minutely in the few ds we have been here and there has hardly passed an hour in which her attempts to stifle or conceal her passion have not rendered it more imperious and more apparent the distant prophecy of my dear harriot is on the point of being fully accomplished chance and nature seem to have conspired in producing every incident and every feeling most likely to promote a match that is ardently wished i know not only by the parties themselves but by many of their friends i have formerly expressed to you with my usual frankness all my fears and scruples on this very delicate business it will i am sure make you happy to hear from my own hand that these scruples are vanquished by the beneficent virtues of your friend you well know my private wishes concerning both yourself and him and what cordial satisfaction it would give me to see two men whose general conduct is so consonant to the purest religion more seriously attached to that only solid foundation both of virtue and of happiness i do not despair of one day possessing this satisfaction in the mean time i must content myself with saying of you both in my own mind what pope i think said openly of garth that if there are good christians in the world without knowing themselves to be so you and seymour are such  let me request you for two reasons my dear edmund to come speedily to us first to establish your own recovery by a seasonable change of air and secondly to take charge of your young friend who cannot i think in decency remain here much longer and had better be stationed with you till the period arrives when a marriage so universally desired may properly take place how adently you lucy and harriot not to speak of the dear dainty widow hersf are panting for that period i am fully appized and believe me i am disposed to say with as much cordialy as of any of you all h vr and ar collations or that or  influence   as my dear harriot has with her usual rapidity prepared a little volume of our diurnal history which travels to lucy with this i say not a word of the joyous occurrences to which i am persuaded her pen has done ample justice i have only to add that seymour sends you both his kindest good wishes with the two letters enclosed he has been so obliging as to favor me with a perusal of the two and different as they are they have both entertained me exceedingly adieu and be assured that your friend instead of finding an enemy in me will soon find it difficult to determine by which of the audleys he is most beloved he has believe me the cordial esteem and best wishes of  your affectionate brother  letter xli seymour to the admiral sir the wound i have lately received from you which is in no danger of proving mortal might justify me perhaps in addressing you with the language of hostility and defiance  but notwithstanding what has passed between us i am ambitious of courting your friendship to which i have an hereditary claim you may have learnt from rumor that the young man you shot in a late hasty scuffle is the son of a person whom though long deceased you probably remember with regard as the intimate friend of your youth allow me sir in right of my father to speak to you the genuine language of friendship to express a sincere esteem for your public character and a lively interest in your glory to solicit your reciprocal regard to give you information and let me presume to say advice of infinite importance to your tranquillity and your honor  you may perhaps he incensed against me for my late conduct but your anger will cease i trust in recollecting that you in my place would have acted exactly as i did i know how difficult it is for a high spirit to relish the idea of retreating either in war or in love but permit me to remind you that a retreat in both may be sometimes more honorable than a victory in the point to which i allude this maxim is strictly true you may do infinite credit to yourself by relinquishing all thoughts of the girl whom you were so resolved to possess believe me sir her heart is invariably fixed on the humble yet gallant lad whose fortune and liberty are in your power i doubt not but when you are convinced of this truth however mortfying it may be to your passion your spirit will suggest to you how a brave man ought to behave toward a successful yet dependant rival let me add that in the name of my father and as the highest favor you can show to the son of a man once so dear to you i most fervently and respectfully request from you the immediate discharge of edward monson  my connections in life are such that i could soon obtain from the highest naval authority what i would much rather receive from your indulgence  the son of your spirited old friend may be permitted to add as a proof of his legitimacy that if his just and courteous petitions are rejected he wants not either resolution or perseverance to carry those points by force which honor and justice have excited him to pursue  i shall close this friendly letter by the best of good wishes that as you have gained many laurels by conquering our public enemy you may now enrich them with a nobler palm by subduing yourself this as all the great moralists assure us is the most honorable of victories and that it may be soon added to those which have already reflected a luster on your name is the ardent wish of sir  your most humble and faithful servant  letter xlii the admirals answer you are a lad of spirit and i am glad to find you inherit the cleverness as well as the courage of your father though i certainly thought you a cursed impertinent fellow i rejoice in your escape i would rather have sent the whole sex to the devil than have killed so promising a son of my lively old friend poor ned  i thank you for your good advice and give you this in return make the most of your youth among the girls as you see what slippery and ungrateful jades they are to a greyheaded lover i dismiss at your request the happy rascal who had the art to steal from me the finest wench in the world  he comes to you with this and his discharge in his pocket so i hope to hear and to think no more of this d   d foolish business  yours faithfully  letter xliii from mrs audley to lucy i send off a servant express to stop our dear edmund if he is not already on his way to this house so lately the scene of hope and exultation and now of despondency and wretchedness of wretchedness produced from the most idle piece of folly that ever was heard of alas my dear lucy all our highraised hopes are i fear overthrown for ever seymour himself has ruined all in a fit of intoxication or rather of frenzy surely wine was an invention of the devil to render man an image of himself my father takes the part i apprehended he would on the slightest opportunity of this kind my dear audley is laboring with his usual goodness to repair the mischief that intemperance has produced but i am afraid it is irreparable poor cornelia is more dead than alive but as the man and horse are waiting i will dispatch this immediately and send you particulars by the post i am anxious that you and my brother should now remain at home as i am persuaded your friend will not continue here under his present disgrace but will sl to you for consolation and counsel  no words can express how grieved to the heart i am for this provoking destroyer of his own and our felicity and still more for the unoffending sufferer farewell the moment i have sealed this i shall begin a full account of the bitter change in our scene as i know you will sympathise but too deeply with  your mortified yet not utterly hopeless and ever affectionate harriot  letter xliv from the same to the same alas my dear lucy i feel so dispirited exasperated and bewildered so intoxicated in short with rage against intoxication that i can hardly collect soberness of spirit sufficient to give you the sad circumstantial history that i have promised how very grievous is it to have seen the most delightful of human prospects so foolishly and miserably blasted in a moment ah my dear girl what inconsiderate wretches are these captivating men i am almost inclined to think you perfectly right in having renounced them entirely it is no wonder that the complaints of human infelicity are so frequent how many many virtues are required to form that rare and lovely spectacle happiness and how able is a single vice to produce in an instant that common and deplorable sight extensive misery you will not be surprised that i am sunk into this moralizing fit since as poor calista says on a very different occasion here is room for meditation even to madness  our present trouble is the more bitter because the prelude to it was a scene of the purest pleasure that i ever experienced i must begin by telling you that yesterday happened to be the birthday of the eldest sedley seymour who is passionately fond of this charming boy requested that the day might be celebrated with peculiar festivity and that to render it a double jubilee it might be fixed for the wedding day of monson and caroline my father who exults in all festivity that carries a religious sanction along with it not only joined in the request but desired to have the pleasure of uniting this lovely couple you will believe this business was readily adjusted without a dissentient or even a hesitating voice for caroline though truly modest has not a grain of prudery in her composition seymour who was recovered enough to attend the ceremony which was performed in the chapel here acted as father to the bride with his usual elegance of manners and visibly felt emotions not inferior to those of a real parent on the occasion here i wished not a little for you my dear lucy for as you think a wedding where youth and beauty are united with genuine affection a very touching drama you must have shed many delicious tears had you been with us there was no creature present but ourselves and five servants of the family my father read the service with peculiar energy and feeling and the whole scene was conducted with such devout decency and universal delight that for my part i wept i believe from one end of it to the other how poor cornelia was affected i really cannot tell you for she very ingeniously contrived to conceal her face the whole time but she did not escape from the chapel without a visible crimson blush which the tender caroline very innocently occasioned the gentlemen as usual paid their compliment to the bride but as soon as seymour had touched her lip this charming girl who is perfectly the child of nature dropped on her knee and kissing his hand aid to him with all the enthusiasm of simplicity and gratitude may heaven sir soon make you as happy as you have now made your two grateful dependents i should deserve to lose the husband you have given me if i departed from the altar without uttering this prayer of my heart most of the party smiled at the native innocence and thankful enrgy of her devotion seymour raised and kissed her again in a rapture of reciprocal gratitude while poor cornelia was covered not with one blush but a succession of blushes which i leave you my dear lucy to interpret as you please you i know will interpret them as a sort of silent counterpart to the audible prayer of caroline why good heaven was the prayer of so pure and fervent a spirit to be rejected why was the welldeserved happiness of this excellent couple to be poisoned so cruelly just in its completion  poisoned it certainly is for these good graceful creatures are too warmly attached to their benefactor to enjoy even their union now they find he is unhappy he has indeed made himself completely so for the present and perhaps for the rest of his days  i am called from my paper to attend my husband and our afflicted hostess adieu for some hours i will resume my narration the first moment that i am at liberty  i return to you my dear lucy with a spirit both saddened and comfored by what i have been witness to since i quitted my pen you will join with me i am sure n loving my dear indulgent audley still better if possible an ever when i tell you what pains he is taking to counteract the horrid incidents of yesterday which i am still to relate to you before i enter upon them i must acquaint you that my husband has just pt seymour into our chaise to convey him in his present humiliated yet still too fiery state of spirits to a scene of solitude and friendship they are to pass two days alone together at our house and return to us on the third this is a benevolent project of my husbands from which he has great expectations i am to remain here with my father and to keep him if possible in a rt of silent neutrality that we may all meet again without any discord passing to use my dear audleys parliamentary phrase an act of indemnity and oblivion i most heartily wish indeed that we could all swallow a cup of lethe and entirely forget the evening of yesterday as soon as i have fulfilled my promise of imparting to you in this packet the circumstances that have rendered it so detestable i shall strive with all my spirit to banish them not only from my own remembrance but from that of our poor cornelia on whose tender bosom they have made the most deep and cruel impression an impression which if it is as my father asserted the provident work of heaven i must not expect and i should not wish to erase but there is as you and i have often agreed a severity in his doctrine to which i cannot immediately subscribe i was at first indeed most bitterly provoked against seymour he ought to have been more on his guard at such a time and in such a place yet such are the particulars of the case that he seems to me much more entitled to compassion than to censure and cannot help thinking it a barbarous fatality that made him wretched just at the season when the beneficent exertion of his many virtues had given him the fairest title to happiness it was the most trifling circumstance imaginable that produced all the mischief you know my father is no enemy to moderate festivity or as your brother said of him he has a true priestly relish for an orthodox bottle as our ill fortune would have it he chanced two days before our humble wedding to commend before seymour some very rich and rare wine its name i forget it is not tkay seymour recollected that he had a little store of it in his cellar which a foreign ambassador had presented to his father and he instantly resolved to produce a hamper of it at the weddingdinner and to honor the birthday of the dear little sedley we all exclaimed against it as an impossibility it could not arrive in time no matter it must be attempted you know the foible of our hero his ardent spirit pursues even a sportive whim of his fancy as if it was a point on which the safety of an empire depended his favorite servant was sent off and commanded to return with a hamper in a postchaise by the time appointed the fellow traveled day and night but you know the great distance of seymours countryseat from this house the expected wine did not arrive for the capital toasts after dinner yet in the universal joy of the day it was hardly regretted the evening came and we were all sober and happy though the gentlemen seemed a little elated by what they had drank cornelia however had drawn them from their bottles to her teatable to which at my particular desire the bride and bridegroom were admitted for i was solicitous to save the modest caroline from that jocular and coarse festivity which i knew would prevail in the lower part of the house as it was my father put her once out of countenance before us it is strange that old men are always on these occasions more gross than young ones here i must do him the justice to say our favorite seymour appeared to great advantage his conversation though very lively was delicate in the extreme and thus far indeed it was a day of delight it was now late in the evening but just as the teatable was removed and preparation was making for a quiet game of cards the fatal hamper arrived seymour instantly exclaimed come doctor you shall drink the health of the day in your favorite wine come monson it would be barbarous to pin a bridegroom to a cardtable especially as it is high time for the ladies to begin undressing the bride we will leave them to that ceremony and drink to the general joy of the whole houe below with this festive exclamation he carried off my father to his wine leading also young sedley in his hand he promised cornelia however that he would only suffer the child to have a glass of the new wine and restore him instantly to her care a promise which he performed very faithfully and in person imprinting a kiss on the fair hand of the parent in placing the charming but tired and sleepy boy on her bosom  would to heaven he had taken as good care of himself my heart felt a melancholy presage in the very moment when he seized my father by the arm and i gave my husband a caution to watch over them bth which he would certainly have done had not a most unseasonable accident called him from the party the happy monson who is as temperate as he is brave could not be tempted beyond a second glass after which in spite of teir raillery he stole away to the arms of his expecting caroline in a few minutes after he lt the company my dear audley was most unluckily entreated by the old butler to terminate a foolish quarrel between one of our servants and one of cornelias this idle fray detained him much longer than he was aware and on his return to the parlour he found seymour and my father both flushed with wine and both still more heated by argument with the large family bible lying open between them my father venting his indignation with great vehemence against the profaneness of seymour and seymour playing numerous and unutterable tricks of impious buffoonery in vain did my dear audley endeavor to put them into good humor with each other and get them quietly to bed finding this impracticable he conceived a desperate project of which you will hardly think him capable but for which you will give him the more credit this was to make the two disputants completely drunk that they might entirely forget what they had uttered against each other and lose every trace of their religious dissension he says he thought himself supremely politic in this scheme and was stered with a momentary gleam of success but seymour by an unfortunate allusion to the marriage in cana rekindled the furious zeal of my father who after uttering the bitterest reike to the young intoxicated infidel quitted e room in a tempest of pious indignation smour whose volatile spirits were now raised to the most frantic merriment wanted first to ain and then to follow him this however my husband prevented and by great exertions  his wild companion from exposing himself t the servants alas my dear lucy what a strange night of mingled joy and horror was this the different scenes of it are so deeply impressed on my mind that i think they can never depart from my memory as long as i exist and they will frequently appear as actually passing before me but you are impatient for the sequel well after a little pause and a few deep sighs i will proceed  cornelia and i had just attended the lovely bride to her chamber we had received her last maidenly adieu and left the charming agitated gil in a sweet disorder of tremors tenderness and tears from her room we had retired to that of cornelia where in two little beds on each side her own and under one canopy her beautiful boys lay like two little angels asleep our lovely friend whose tender nerves had been much affected in taking leave of caroline seated herself at the feet of her bed and looked as i was saucy enough to tell her like a more hapless heroine described by row warm tender full of wishes while i was rallying the gentle creature on her passion for seymour and the great chance he would have of success if he could press her to an immediate marriage at that moment while the dear candid soul more than half confessed that i was right in reading the emotions of her heart the door suddenly opened upon us and in rushed my father to warn the mistress of the manso against harboring such an impious wretched as seymour under her roof  think my dear lucy what i endured at this moment and paint to yourself the sweet countenance of our cornelia changing at once from the soft expression of tenderness love and hope to the troubled looks of surprise remorse and despair i endeavored to hurry my father from her chamber but he was not in a mood to be either wheedled or controuled he was certainly a little inflamed by wine yet his faculties were rather quickened than impaired and though he spoke with great austerity against the favorite object of our wishes i must confess that i never heard him so eloquent in my life he told cornelia that after the horrid blasphemies to which he had been witness below he should think himself deficient in his duty to earth and heaven if he failed to caution her against the peril in which he saw her involved he then represented the dangers of marrying a young man of strong passions without a particle of religion with such vehemence of language and force of imagery that for my part i felt a cold horror strike through me and poor cornelia was thrown into sobs and tears  when he perceived her weeping he grew infinitely gentler in his manner and folding her hand within his said with a parental emotion i pity you from my soul i see to what excess you love this alluring this pernicious infidel and how could you do otherwise than love him he is the most seducing of mortals a man in who might easily tempt half your sex to make themselves the greatest of wretches but condr my dear lady what dignity and firmness of character we have a right to expect from you i will not argue the matter as a point of reason and judgment but consult the best feelings of sensibility look at these little monitors pointing to her children and ask your own bosom if any partiality any passion however founded on the most dazzling of human attractions can justify you to your own heart if you give to these innocents for their example their guide their father an absolute monster of impiety the feeling mother was almost suffocated by her tears on this pointed address to her maternal character perceiving that she had no power to speak and wishing to own the truth that she should not find an opportunity lest she should utter some precipitate resolution for which we might all be sorry in a cooler moment i ventured to argue with my father at the imminent hazard of enraging him still more in behalf of the dear abominable delinquent i said it was cruel to let a few words however impious uttered by an intoxicated man cancel the merit of actions not only splendid in point of generosity and courage but distinguished by the true spirit of cristian charity in short i was told in the defense of poor seymour and did ample and affectionate justice to those virtues by which he has raised himself so high in our esteem my father heard me with a degree of temper and patience that i did not expect he did not once interrupt me but he said as soon as i paed my dear harriot i do not blame you for looking with a fond and enthusatc admiration on the noble and captivating accomplishments of this dangerous seymour but trust me to marry a young man possessing all these attractions and hiding under them a deep mass of impiety is exactly like building a delightful palace in the tempting neighborhood of vesuvio for a while you may be charmed with your situation the air is delicious the prospect enchanting but a sudden and unexpected burst of the latent fire converts the gay residence of delusive security into a scene of the most terrific devastation believe me there is nothing in the human character on which it is safe to build but the solid rock of religion encouraged by the mildness with which my father had listened to me before i attempted to moderate in some degree the austerity and intolerance of this maxim by this attempt i unluckily rekindled his indignation and he said to me in a very severe tone harriot you are the last person in the world who ought to appear as an advocate for irreligion have the gratitude and the decency to recollect that all the rare happiness of your own life arises from my having given you a man of genuine piety for your husband then turning to cornelia he said madam you know how ardently i love my child yet i protest to you before god i would rather have seen her sink into the grave in all the bloom of her youth and beauty than i would have bestowed her on such a character as i am now endeavoring to caution you against he added a short but impassioned prayer that his caution might prove effectual and then giving us both his benediction retired for the night  as soon as we were alone our lovely friend fell upon my neck and wept most bitterly she could not yet speak but grasped my hand with the vehemence of a poor creature in agonies of pain there was at this time a conflict in her heart and soul more excruciating perhaps than any malades of the body she traversed her chamber with an agitated step paused looked at her children wept and walked again i tried to sooth her by making light of what had passed by repreenting it as a foolish dispute over a bottle that would be utterly forgot the next day but the lovely angel rebuked me with a look of displeasure and exclaimed no my dear harriot you must not any longer flatter and confirm me in this criminal attachment i do not vainly strive to hide from you with what excess of passion i love seymour at this moment yes i love him with that frenzy that if only the perdition of my own soul was hazarded by our union perhaps i could not reject him but for these dearer souls  here she cast her eyes again upon the sweet sleeping boys her voice was suspended but falling on her knee at the feet of her own bed so that she had an equal view of the two children and raising to heaven perhaps the most beautful and impassioned countenance that ever looked up to its creator she said with a trembling voice by the almighty god who gave me thee blessed infants and by the dear saint whose dying injunction commended them to my duty i swear that no temptations shall induce me to make the impious seymour their second father i will never marry again the last words she pronounced in a firmer and even a triumphant accent for they were the dictates of duty and passion united to sacrifice the man she doated on to heaven was a resolve which though her mind was firm in its purpose her lips could hardly utter but to renounce all the sex in honor of this dear victim was a fond idea in which her heart exulted it was granting under the mask and yet with the sanction of duty a secondary triumph to love  ah my dear lucy do you not shudder at the thought of what our poor lovely friend must have to endure either in keeping or in violating this precipitate vow for my part i have the audacity and i know my good girl you will support me in it still to profess myself an advocate for this abominable offender i cannot bear the idea of his being utterly renounced and i maintain that not only love and friendship but religion itself ought to induce us all not to irritate and abandon but to soothe him and labor for his conversion if we succeed and from the gentle firm and persuasive spirit of my dear audley i have great hopes of success the hasty vow of our dear righteous widow becomes void of course we shall still be happy and our happiness will be truly celestial i endeavored to calm our dear cornelia by talking to her in this strain as soon as she had finished her adjuration and troubled as her spirit was it did not turn with abhorrence from this kind of consolation see my dear lucy how well it is for a tender scrupulous sweet soul like our cornelia to have such kind considerate commentators at her elbow as you and i are when she is in the rash humor of vowing a vow while i was administering to her the comfort which she found in seeing that her hasty promise to heaven was conditional i heard a gentle tap at her door behold my husband for heavens sake said i what have you done with seymour has not this fatal wine made him frantic be not alarmed returned my good man looking keenly on the anxious eager countenance of cornelia he has indeed been a little disguised by a slight excess in drinking but this is not surprising after his recent low regimen and on such a day as this his intemperance only proves the affectionate warmth of his heart it is now time for us all to retire as i have put him very peaceably to bed excellent cried i in a transport of joy and now we may all sleep in peace in saying this i gave a significant pressure to the hand of cornelia and we both wished her good night and here lucy i must take leave of you also with the same good wish i can positively write no longer at present but will resume my pen early tomorrow so once more good night  not withstanding my presage that we should all sleep in peace few mortals in health pass a night so sleepless on their pillow as we dd cornlia confessed to me the next day that she had hardly closed her eyes and as to audley and myelf we were kept awake find by talking over all the wild vagaries and extravagancies of seymour in his cups and secondly by meditating on the best possible method of reconciling him and my father and drawing good out of evil i have already told you the project my dear girl which your incomparable brother has devised for this purpose he rose early awakened the poor unconscious culprit into a sense of his trespass in the preceding evening and conveyed him from hence without his seeing either of the two persons who had most reason to he offended with his conduct to both however he sent at my husbands entreaty and by his voice a very humble and suppliant embassy and particularly to my father whom he requested to forget every syllable if any such were uttered in his intoxication that could appear in any degree offensive or disrespectful to his character  a divine to his gentle hostess he made the most tender apology said he felt himself unworthy to enjoy the delht of seeing her the next day but as he was ing to punish himself for his transgression by an immediate and self imposed banishment from her ence he trusted he should find her on his return more ready to pardon him than he was to forgive himself you will easily guess how thee messages were received by the two parties t wom they were addressed as you know both  well the tender widow said that no apology  necessary to her the rigid divine declared  none was sufficient for him i have had indd a terrible task to keep the zeal o my father wiin tolerable bounds but after a long private scene of argument entreaty and tears on my part i have prevailed on him to promise me that he will say nothing more to cornelia on the subject at present i have even brought him to acquiesce in my opinion that the state of seymours affection cooperating with the eloquence of my husband may probably produce a very salutary effect on the creed of this enchanting unbeliever heaven grant my earnest prayer on this point i need not tell you with what anxiety i expect their return i wish it were possible to give you an account of it in this packet as i know your solictude on the subject will not be inferior to my own but many anxious hours are yet to pass before the time of their expected arrival and i have promised you this voluminous history by the very first post you must accept it therefore imperfect as it is in every sense of that word be assured that you shall hear again soon and believe me ever  your affectionate sister p s i cannot close the paper without telling you that the first sight i saw in entering cornelias chamber yesterday morning was our po sleepless friend venting her anguish to the sympathetic bosom of caroline what a contrast in their situaions what a picture did their beautiful t dfferently impassioned features present to me it was felicity comforting despair farewel    letter xlv from seymour to edmund audley you who are so familiar with the past follies of my life you my dear edmund will not be surprised to hear that i have again played the fool more detestably than ever i have made myself a wretch i have disgraced myself in the eyes of my adored cornelia i am no longer under her roof i have committed  but why should i particularize my execrable offenses to you when you have probably learnt by means of the women who write about every thing more circumstances of my misconduct than i know myself  in foolish desire to ingratiate myself with that odious high priest dr ayon who loves his bottle pontifically i drank with him on a double festival that we have celebrated here on the birthday of the brave little sedley and the marriage of my sweet caroline till the doctor lost his temper and i my senses all i can remember of the evening is that we sputtered much pious and propane nonsense in the face of each other nothing could be so absurd nothing so illtimed nthing so injurious to my love as this execrable contention i loath the sight of wine and abhor myself for my folly yet i have found an apologist and a comforter where i little expected and less perhaps deserved to find him it is with peculiar satisfaction that i add  in your brother he has kindly hurried me from a scene where i have exposed and disgraced myself so egregiously to his own tranquil mansion with a thoughtful goodnature that proved him really your brother he suggested to me that my best mode of apologizing for what i most bitterly repent would be to withdraw for a few days leaving only a conciliatory message for the persons who have the greatest right to be offended by my gross indecorum he observed that by thus giving the insulted divine sufficient time to grow cool i might probably induce him to forget our dispute and by showing cornelia that i punish myself for my transgession toward her by tearing myself from her presence i should incline her to receive me with indulgence on my reurn by the force of these friendly reasons your brother drew me to his house we have now been under his roof the better part of two days alone and during that time his incessant attention and kind behavior to me have been such that i cannot more strongly express my sense of it to you than by telling you the words i addressed to him a few minutes ago on our closing a private conference of some hours they were the word f aripa to paul almost thou p  are to be a christian  it has indeed been the eager wish of his benevolent heart to n  on this important occasion and  e impulse of lve or the auments of friendship could induce me to sacrfice my ren or y sincerity i should certainly ither tel or profss at this critical juncture a perfect reverence for mysteries which my spirit my dear edmund as well as yours has ever considered as a mixture of the unintelligible and the ridiculous i reverence indeed his ardent philanthropy and i admire his happiness which is as i freely allowed him superior to what you and i have ever enjoyed or may ever attain but this which he ascribes to his religion i the kind work of nature it is owing to the constitutional equipoise of his passions and the peculiar felicity of his temper he is a man whom superstition cannot spoil and this as i told him is a grand panegyric for the very best kind of superstition is apt to vitiate whatever it touches i am not sure that even the pure the tender the generous bosom of my cornelia herself can resist its influence  at the instigation of that rigid and angry priest whom i have foolishly made my enemy she may perhaps reject me for ever  reject the very man to whom she is in truth attached by affection by gratitude and every honest emotion of her frame my soul is in tumult at this idea i am conscious that i have deserved to experience some little portion of her anger i want no gospel to tell me that intoxication is a beastly failing i am ready to purchase her forgiveness by renouncing intemperance for ever but i have too much noble pride to purchase even her person though it is the only jewel in the world to my apprehension by making myself either a fool or a hypocrite we return to morrow how she will receive me i know not but if she treats me with a coldness and disdain which i am sure are foreign to her nature i feel it may drive me to distraction good heavens to lose such a lovely and loving creature just when her delicious lips have half declared she is devoted to me by protesting she would have no other oh the very idea is momentary mandess i will banish it from my brain and surely the reality my dear edmund would be too heavy a punishment for the offenses the involuntary and repented offenses of  your affectionate seymour  letter xlvi from mr audley to edmund audley i trust that my last letter convinced you my dear edmund how sincerely my heart is disposed to promote the wishes of your engaging friend his very failings have increased my attachment to him as they show me that with a spirit peculiarly benevolent and generous to others he is a most dangerous enemy to himself my dear harriot who really feels for him all the solicitude f a sister has given you i conclude a very melancholy detail of the foolish and provoking incidents they have produced a most uncomfortable change of scene in the house of cornelia i brought seymour to pas a few days with me in privacy under my own roof for two reasons first i was very desirous to prevent the renewal and if possible to annihilate the memory of a furious theological dispute which arose between him and dr ayton in a luckless night of intemperate festivity secondly i cherished a hope that in the quiet of this sequestered scene and in many successive hours of unreserved and friendly conversation i might be fortunate enough to remove from the mind of this interesting young man the only obstacle to his happiness i mean that infidelity which seems to have fastened on his spirit more from the power of accident than from any natural disposition in his character to produce or maintain it it is with the most cordial concern i perceive that my powers of argument and persuasion are too weak to accomplish in your friend my dear edmund as in you that hppy conversion which i most ardently wish to behold in you both i have searched as deeply as i could the springs of incredulity in each of you and i find that these springs are very different but ala they are equally powerful against my wish in your behalf rousseau i think has said that the faith of most men is regulated upon earth by their temporal interest this however is by no means the case with an english gentleman of independent fortune whose creed has little connection with his temporal prosperity that many parents in this rank of like while they teach worldly maxims to their children think it unnecessary to burden them with religious ideas thus young men are left to pick up such a religion as time and chance may happen to afford them their faith of course will greatly depend on their early connexions in life and still more on their particular humors and passions i think my dear edmund that this remark is very strongly exemplified in you and your friend seymour in you as i have often told you infidelity is the offspring of a vitiated imagination in seymour it is the child of an imperious passion and i fear the firmest of passion pride it pleased heaven to give you with a strong understanding a much greater propensity to ridicule and sarcam than is commonly united to a heart so tender as yours the applause very justly given to your early wit and humor augmented this dangerous prpensity thus your mind was allured into the habit of considering even the most serious objects in a ludcrous point of view your first associates in the world were unfortunately men who treaed christianity with derison you were amused in laughing with them and pleased to increase their merriment by your superior vivacity but as the fire of youth abated your natural good sense my dear edmund soon taugt you on these articles a great degree of caution and reserve you ceased to ridicule religion but though prudence and good nature conspired to make you desist from a practice which you could not pursue without creating to yourself many enemies you could not correct the internal mischief which the habit too long indulged had impressed upon your mind you could indeed cease to ridicule religion but you could not cease to think religion ridiculous the bias given to your youthful fancy was too powerful for your reason even in its maturity to counteract and how many men have we seen unable in advanced life to embrace the comforts of genuine piety from no other cause but the having been idly tempted to laugh at them in their youth it is difficult in the highest degree to bring the human spirit to contemplate with reverence what it has once been accustomed to treat with derision and as to yourself my dear edmund i am convinced as i have often said to you by my own ineffectual but affectionate endeavors to change the cast of your mind that nothing but some great and unexpected calamity or sickness nothing in short but some striking event that may convulse as it were like an earthquake your whole bodily and intellectual frame can take from your warped imagination that unfortunate bent which i have so frequently lamented with your friend seymour i had flattered myself on a prospect of better success as his mind has not been so much under the fascination of ridicule i hoped to find it more open to reason i was willing to think that even his passions might act as my confederates and that love which has settled as you sportively said the creed of many princes might help me to make a happy convert of him but love i find in its warmest excess is a passion much weaker than pride at least it proves so in your friend he doats upon cornelia but with a firmness of proud incredulity which i both lament and admire he will not purchase even the idol of his heart by what he considers a sacrifice of his own dignity as a man nay so tenacious is he of imaginary honor in this point that if my long and repeated conferences had really converted him he says he should be almost tempted to suppress his belief at this juncture lest his friends should suppose that love had made him an hypocrite in religion so vehement is his detestation to every shadow of duplicity and falsehood  it is impossible not to love a character so open so ingenuous so ardent and so firm however deluded he may be it is equally impossible at least for a man who tnks seriously of religion not to wish him possessed of only thing which can render his enchanting qualities no longer dangerous to himself you my dear brother have both experience and discretion i might even say timidity in the conduct of life to protect you against the perils of your own foibles and passions but it is not so with our friend undiguised in all he thinks and precipitate in all he does he is peculiarly exposed to the malice of fortune and the more i reflect on his present situation the more i am alarmed for what is to come  as to myself he has reduced me to a most uncomfortable dilemma i cannot take an active part in opposing his wishes without wounding not only my friendship for you but those sentiments of regard with which he has inspired me for himself nor can i be very earnest and decisive in promoting his hopes of marrying cornelia consistently with my conscience i have the sincerest good wishes to them both i clearly perceive they are so deeply enamoured of each other that they must be wretched asunder yet if they are united there is a prospect of equal and perhaps of superior wretchedness from their unhappy difference the great article of religion an arcle which the dying injunction of poor sedley hs rendered so pecularly imprtant to corelia that i question induce if seymour with the united powers of love and friendship with his own attractions and my recommendation if i dared to recommend him could triumph without a change in his creed over the scrupulous piety of my lovely ward i am almost convinced that she would perish in those wasting maladies which are apt to arise from vehement disappointed affection much rather than gratify her heart by a violation of her duty yet a woman a tender young and impassioned woman is we all know a frail creature and perhaps i ought to take the most determinate steps to secure the gentle being bequeathed to my care from a trial so perilous and severe  i am truly bewildered by the various vexations perplexities and dangers on every side i feel owever that my mind has gained some little relief in thus copiously unburthening itself to you i am sure you will be ready to cooperate with me in what i most wish at present which is to keep seymour as quiet as possible any precipitate importunity in his addresses just now would be very cruel to cornelia and must i think be ulvous to himself he appears not a little affected by the sincerity of my zeal for his happiness and he promises to be guided in a great measure as to his present conduct by me but i perceive the imetuosity of his spirit and am perfectly aware that it will be very difficult to keep him from acting according to the sudden and accidental impulse of his imperious passion as you are the only person in the world possessing long and confirmed influence over this impetuous youth pray let your letters to him be persuasive lessons of tranquillity and patience by gaming time we may do much for his good i should tell you he has made one generous and important concession he has promised that if he marries cornelia all her children shall be educated as devoutly as she and i may think proper he will never interfere with the religion of his own wife or her family he even thinks they may be much the happier for being good christians yet so inconsistent are men they will take no pains to eradicate from their own minds those early habits and prejudices which have hardened them against a faith whose beneficial influence on the happiness of its true professors they heartily acknowledge  but lest you should think i am giving you a sermon without end my dear edmund i will only add that we return tomorrow to sedleyhall and that i propose on the following day to remove the whole party to my house for which i have an excellent plea in the visit i expect from my dear harriots lively niece louisa mountmaurice who is coming to pass a month with us and coming as she says in a saucy note that i found from her here with a resolution to rob the lovely widow of her wounded knight and make a conquest of the gallant seymour for herself whether she succeeds or not you will be informed in due time accept my benediction on yourself and lucy and believe me ever  your affectionate brother  letter xlvii from seymour to edmund audley behold me dear edmund restored to sedleyhall and my good genius himself seemed to hail my return in the shape of a servant who informed me as your brother and i alighted at the door that dr ayton is gone to london i could not help exclaiming in the words of madeth being gone i am myself again in sober truth i greatly dreaded a second meeting with this stiff piece of orthodox austerity i neither chose to play the servile penitent or the hypocrite with him nor to let him play the insolent schoolmaster and tyrannical bigot with me i thank my stars that the tidings of a tottering more have hurried him to the metropoli that he may watch it as the witch does the drop on the corner of the moon and catch it ere it fall to the ground  my dear indulgent cornelia has received me with that graceful gentleness which is so peculiar to herself and she made so kind a reply to my repeated apology for my late transgression that as i told her i felt the various pains that i have suffered from my folly delightfully repaid in the sweetness of her pardon there is indeed a delicacy in the manners of cornelia which i never found in those of any other woman and which is the result of her genuine unaffected and temperate sensibility the whole sex may i think be comprehended in two classes the lively and the serious the first often overwhelm us by their vivacity and the second by their gloom but cornelia is a perfect model of the true happy medium her gaiety is as mild and benignant as the smile of an angel and her melancholy instead of diffusing sadness inspires only tenderness and love such she has appeared to me on the many many reflections which i have made in various humors on this incomparable woman yet i must add with sorrow that although her first reception of me was enchantingly gracious and perfectly like herself in some moments since my return i have thought i perceived a new character creeping like a mist over her mind her native ease has now and then changed into a cold and stately politeness that struck like a falling isicle on my bosom and seemed both to lacerate and to petrfy my heart i could not help whispering to her though there was company in the room if you treat me with an air of proud indifference you will very soon make a madman of me for life i believe she was both vexed and pleased by this intimation it had certainly a happy influence on her biour and my feelings for she never spoke to me afterward but with such a softness of voice that the tones of it sunk into my soul oh edmund this dear delicious woman must be mine or my life will not be worth preserving  what has passed in our short absence i have not yet learned as i have only had a few encouraging looks from my very good friend mrs audley and a brief exhortation from her not to be precipitate but resign myself to hope and heaven she is an indulgent kind creature and she has been i understand very warm in my defense at the hazard of incurring her righteous fathers displeasure yet much as she is my friend i cannot depend on her imparting to me explicitly all that i want to know but i have one sure channel of intelligence as soon as i can get my grateful caroline alone i am confident that her gratitude will induce her to reveal to me all the secrets of the female cabinet to which i know she is admitted it is fortunate for me that she and her happy monson are to return with us and the ladies to your brothers he has kindly insisted on carrying us all to his own hospitable mansion tomorrow where he expects to find a niece of mrs audleys from ireland a lovely girl they say and wonderfully like cornelia in form and shape of her features but not so in the expression of her countenance since vivacity is the characteristic of one and tenderness of the other mrs audley has been jesting with me concerning the beauties of her niece and a design which she sportively ascribes to her of making a conquest of me by heaven i thought that cornelia who overheard part of our discourse without our intending it turned pale at the sound o venus if this soft creature should really love me well enough to grow seriously jealous of a young irish hoyden if she does i defy the devil himself and a legion of his lovethwarting priests to keep us asunder but i must bid you very hastily adieu indeed i should not have written till we are all comfortably settled for a few weeks at audley grove had i not thought you would be particularly anxious for an account of my reception from the dear offended hostess of this mansion i was eager also to inform you of the seasonable departure of the odious high priest and the prospect or rather the glimpse i have of new and exquisite delight under the friendly roof of your brother among all the joys of an enraptured heart there can be none superior to that of raising a sweet impassioned woman whose fond imagination has plunged her in the torments of jealous terror to the paradise of tranquil and confident affection farewell and fail not to wish that the joy which i anticipate in my fancy may soon be actually possessed by  your very faithful and affectionate seymour  letter xlviii from mrs audley to lucy your goodnatured heart my dear lucy will rejoice in being told that our cloudy prospect is grown wonderfully clearer an unexpected incident has happened which contributes not a little to our general ease and comfort though i am almost ashamed to speak of it even  you as a source of satisfaction for the incident i mean is the sudden departure of my father who has been hastily summoned by private business to london i trust that i revere him a much as i ought to do and i am sure i do full justice to the goodness of his intentions yet to own the truth to you no tender miss watching  an opportunity to receive a lover in private er heard the departing wheels of her fathers riage with more heartelt satifaction than i  i had terrified myself with the idea that  being righteous over much he would ruin  only the happiness bt the health of our  cornelia who if it is necessary at last  haven fod that her infantine heart sold be weaned from  must be treated  that cruel operation with a gentleness and indulgence not very compatible with the inflexible and imperious integrity of my father but he is gone and without a prospect of returning hither for which i believe you also my good girl will be wicked enough to exclaim heaven be praised  i have still greater news for you the bewitching offender is returned and received and forgiven whether my good man has brought him back to us exactly what we wish i cannot inform you as we have had no time for private conversation and i write in great haste to tell you we are all preparing to decamp my niece louisa is by this time at audley grove and our whole party is to adjourn to our house for the better reception of this charming sprightly girl who has at length obtained the permission of her father to pass a few months with us she is determined she says to set her cap at your gallant and princely seymour do you not tremble for poor cornelia alas what hypocries we weak women would be if we could to one another and to ourselves would you beleve that our candid friend on my jesting with her a few minutes ago about louisa and seymour had the hypocrisy to say she wished it might be a match on my answering her only with a keen glance of penetration and reproof she burst into tears and said with her native ingenuous tenderness i strive to wish it but i cannot  here she comes again into my room i suppose with some anxous enquiry concerning this formidable louisa but of t is and all other interesting matters i will write to you very soon after my return at present i can only add that cornelia desires to be most kindly remembered to you and that i am with much better hopes than when i closed my last packet  your affectionate sister harriot audley  letter xlix from edmund audley to seymour your letters my dear seymour have acted as medcine upon my spirits in the course of an illness into which i have relapsed and from which i am once more recovered sometimes indeed the medicine was too strong for the patient and at one period my anxiety for you and my terrors of dr ayton considerably increased the nervous fever which has proved such an obstinate enemy to my health and comfort but the highpriests most seasonable departure and the very cordial regard which i am now doubly assured my brother has conceived for you inspire me with salutary and enlivening hopes i clearly perceive that the capricious goddess goodfortune is hastening to embrace you and complete your happiness do not i conjure you in your impetuous eagerness to meet her beat the fair divinity backwards and overset all her intended bounty  you find me as usual still ready to load you with cautionary counsel and in truth my dearest friend i never knew any period in your eventful life where i saw greater reason or felt a more anvius desire to throw a gentle curb over the native precipitancy of your spirit indeed in proportion as you have advanced in that path which is to lead i trust to happiness i have felt more and more solicitous lest one hasty false step should prevent your reacting the object of your ambition you are now happily advanced so far that if you will but trust patiently to time he will complete your wishes and believe me however nonsenscally it may sound to you both in expression and sentiment to stand still is your surest was to get forward you have gained the eart of the woman you love you have gained the friendship of the man whose situatin and allow me to say whose virtues give him a fair tile to influence her conduct but justly regard as you are by both they are both very full of certain apprehensions concerning you i by any rash and passionate attempts to accelerate the event for which you are so eager you increase and exasperate these apprehensions the consquence must be universal wrechdn to us all but if on the other hand you at with the generous forbearance that i am now adently recommending to you their fears will gradually evaprate you will appear to them the dsinterested affectonate and generous being which you really are your success must be inevitable since you have no rivals to apprehend and in thus securing your own happiness you will make us all happy  i could wish that my good brother had been successful in his very zealous endeavors for your conversion since it is otherwise allow me to suggest to your reflection how far it may be consistent i will not say with prudence for i know you despise that coldblooded quality but with love honor and generosity to assume an appearance of that creed which your mistress and your friend have so affectionately wished to impress upon your mind it is needless i trust to assure you that i have an abhorrence as vehement as your own for all the arts of a sordid and selfish hypocrisy but when dissimulation is practiced for no purpose but to ensure the tranquillity and happiness of those we love it ought surely to lose the name and character of baseness and to be ranked among the noblest of virtues it is then that we may speak of falsehood in the spirited language of tasso and justly say magnarima mersogna or quando e il veo si belle che si possa a te preporte magnanimous falsehood when is truth so beautiful as to merit the preference to thee  i quote an italian poet to show you that i have not utterly neglected your injunction concerning that language though i reproach myself for not having learned it as i ought to have done in the happier days of giuliana  were i in your situation i should find a mavelous delight in cherishing such an affectionate illusion in the mind of my mistress i should exult in persuading her that she had made me every thing she wished how charming must it be to gratify the fond pride of her soul in making her believe that by the tenderness which ministered to your earthly pleasure she was literally leading you to heaven how exquisite must the soft features of your cornelia appear when animated with the mingled fire of triumphant piety and gratified affection trust me my dear seymour those happy rogues whether hypocrites or not have had the keenest enjoyment of women who have had the art to mix devotion with love i cannot say i have great hopes of your regarding my suggestions to you on this subject for i know yon have such a romantic attachment to truth that you would rather make yourself miserable for life by adhering to it than condescend t be usefully and even generously deceitful what a pity it is that the most obstinate votaries are those of imaginary virtue  i can easily conceive how you would exult in raising a little jealous apprehension in the soft bosom of cornelia but have a care my good friend do not by attempting to waken jealousy in one tender heart inadvertently throw an amorous flame into another you are too dangerous a fellow to trifle with an artless and glowing girl of eighteen though louisa mountmaurice from the peculiar sprightliness of her character might be more able to defend her heart against your insinuating attractions than the making cornelia yet pray remember that this niece of your good friend harriot is composed like the rest of her sex of combustible atoms and do not suffer your cupid to shake his torch too near her as to the advantages you seem to expect from making cornelia jealous i have many doubts on that article doubt you know is the characteristic of my mind and decision of yours i think much evil might arise from it and a consequence directly opposite to what your quick fancy has suggested but i will not pester you with all the thorny conjectures on a contingency that will hardly happen i must however inform you what your very zealous friend lucy says on your idea she entreats you whatever degree of pleasure or influence you may expect to derive from it never to pursue so barbarous an expedient she says what i am convinced is strictly true that your fairones heart is already as entirely yours as love can make it and why should you cruelly fill it with agonies that cannot increase its affection lucy goes so far as to affirm that your tender widow has not strength of mind or body sufficient to support the pangs of the most eterucating passion and if you make her really jealous in the present perplexed state of her spirits you must inevitably destroy either her life or her senses though i do not quite subscribe to this fearful idea of my sisters i cannot help joining her in conjuring you to be cautious be assured my dearest friend that if you will be but temperate and patient if you will only allow sufficient time for that love which is certainly the predominant passion of her soul to subdue and expel the terror that yet adheres to it you will soon make her your wife upon the terms that are most agreeable to your own manly spirit i am apprised of the generous proposals which you have made to my brother concerning the education of her children and trust me both your queen and her honest privycounsellor will if you do not perplex them with your precipitancy acquiesce in this desirable union on the ground you propose but their acquiescence must be the work of deliberation and of time i will now release you from this tedious lecture but let me once more repeat our entreaty for i speak both in lucys name and my own that you will not make yourself wretched by too great an eagerness to be happy pardon the prolixity of your timid affectionate preceptor and believe me  ever faithfully yours  end of the volume
