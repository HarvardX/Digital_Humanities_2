the trueborn englishman a satyr answered paragraph by paragraph  nescio qua natale solum dulcedine cunctos ucit and immemores non sinit esse sui ovid london printed in the year   0   to the right worshipful sir charles duncomb knt and alderman of the city of london sir though your merit has such an established basis that neither the malice of the evil speaker nor the restless attempts of the evil doer can shake it and your memory stands secured of fame and immortality in spite of the murmurs of the seditious and the prevailing numbers of a sort of people who are unacquainted with justice or fair dealing yet it is but fitting that some should stand up in vindication of what every one should defend and assert the cause of a gentleman whose works of charity deserve better returns than the base and uncharitable reflections that are flung upon him  but you have this consolation amongst the clamours of the ungrateful that the same person who makes it his business to misrepresent your virtues and render em odious if possible to posterity has done the same by your country and as you have always stood up for the kingdoms good against all manner of opposers so you are now a sufferer with it from the calumnies that are equally darted against both  to be a patriot in these days is to provide a task for the tongues of the envious and to give alms and relieve those that are in want is immediately set down for an act of ostentation else sir charles duncomb had seen his countrymen reap the fruits of what he sowed and the voice of the people had blessed him for giving ear to the cry of the prisoners and plentifully dealing part of what he was possessed of to people in distress  but i give more offense to your patience in remembering you of the good you have done than the poetaster who has occasioned the following remarks by putting on the readers belief by the ill you have not and it is equally troublesome to be accused of faults you are not guilty of as it is to be told of virtues which are inherent in your temper and shine with such a continued luster in all your actions  i shall therefore only leave my petition behind me for your acceptance of what the knowledge of your worth has occasioned and if the papers i have written have not done that justice either to my country or your self which both deserved that you would give me leave to beg pardon for their defects and impute em to the too hasty zeal of  sir your most humble and most obedient servant  the preface there being nothing material in the preface to this scurrilous satyr that has not been repeated over and over again in the body of it i cannot but think it very suitable to the business in hand to forbear making any further remarks on the poets indecencies and apply my self to make excuses for my own  if the performance i have let loose into the world is bad i have nothing to urge in my own defense but the have i was obliged to make in the finishing it through the desire of two or three friends and the difficulty there is in answering a pamphlet paragraph by paragraph which has such a redundancy of tautologies as this has  i should indeed have made my reply to it in verse that being counted the fairer way of entering the lists with a poet but as i never had any great inclination to dactyls and spondees so i was afraid i should show my self as great a bungler at the trade of rhiming as the person has convinced the world he is whom i write in opposition to  however since he ends his preface in verse i hope i shall stand excused if i make use of the same method and give the reader a short specimen of my poetry after he has tired him with a large one of his my intent at first notwithstanding my small acquaintance with the nine water drinking ladies the muses was to have taken up the cudgels with him in verse but such a design requiring more time than i have to bestow upon poetry i thought it advisable to lay it aside that i might drudge on in the beaten way of good honest humble prose and have flung by the following lines which were written as so many answers to his two first paragraphs satyr arise thy whips and stings provide and shake thy scorpions on thy countrys side while her own sons their parents bowels tear and meditate a more than civil war speak speak the cause that makes the viprous breed the rules of modesty and truth exceed eager to deal about their want of shame and impiously elaspheme britannias name the land has yet though punished for it is crimes patriots who dare be just in thankless times whom neither gifts nor pensions can persuade tamely to see their liberties betrayed or foreigners their proper rights invad not that they would alliances disclaim but d  chmen are at home at am  am and it has been a customary thing for englishmen to serve an english king else had our senators with patience heard mine here to pr  cip  lity preferred and h  deservedly the nations boast forborne reflections on a p  g  s post but since excess of r  y  l bounty falls and he commands within the p  lace walls since on his leg the british order shines and he disdains his belgic fathers loins the goldenkey not makes the patriot speak but englands honor and his countries sake   the true bornenglishman a satyr answered paragraph by paragraph as it is the duty of every one that breaths english air to stand up for the place of his nativity and vindicate the english nation from the reproaches which malice would fasten on it so i cannot but think my self obliged to take notice of a libel which has stolen into the world under the name of a satyr and dispersed its venom in a concealed manner against a people whose reputation in the arts of war and peace has rendered em famous throughout all christendom had the author of it been an open enemy perhaps i could have born it but he is our acquaintance and our familiar friend a man subject to the same laws as englishmen are and liable to the same obligations entertained by em when he was forced to fly from the scourges of ireland and hospitably received when he had not where to lay his head in a kingdom which owes her obedience to this the printer also is known for what he is a sour discontented canting fellow as ever murmured at falling manna or found fault with the bounties of the almighty he has formerly been made city surveyor for a crime of the same nature and taken a prospect of its buildings from his wooden edifice in the middle of the street and one might have thought unless he was in love with that scandalous office he would have avoided all manner of occasion of bring lifted up above his neighbors again but he is arrived to such a height of malignancy such an inveteracy of temper as to be his authors humble servant while he was lampooning his god and making sport with the divine existence of him that made him therefore it is not to be supposed he would stick at lending his helping hand toward abuses upon the country where he would have us think him born after he had been forward in promoting blasphemous expressions against the holy one of israel that gave him breath i shall have field enough elsewhere to take the author to task who acknowledged he expected it in his preface though for other sort of indecencies than his mean style rough verse and incorrect language and make appear he labors under a greater scarcity of manners than the country he shows his teeth at ever can we are happy indeed that a man of his character has no great esteem for us and it is a certain sign a people is good when those who are notoriously wicked speak reproachfully of em since it must be granted few men fall out with their own likeness or are at variance with their own resemblance but a man is known by his works and the way to make him appear in his true colors is to search into em and find out the blackness of his soul by the foulness of his thoughts it is fitting therefore we fall into the satyr and examine whether the poet be as infamous as the subject or he has the same talent of ingratitude in verse as he is celebrated for in prose mr t  has a fit of mortification coming upon him or he would have less value for the hungry entertainments on mount parnassus and is reconciling himself to his old jesuitical abstinence and days of fasting or he would scarce fall in love with telling his fingers and making wry faces for adequate epithets as he now certainly does while his versifying folly gives us occasion to examine his other faults and make an estimate of the last from the wretched ingredients the first is composed of but his poetry carries such an invitation with it that it is pity the reader should be any longer detained from it i shall begin therefore with the invocation of his muse which i find is but a very scurvey one by her name and to avoid confusion make remarks on this celebrated piece paragraph after paragraph  the introduction speak satyr for there is none can tell like thee whether it is folly pride or knavery that makes the discontented land appear less happy now in times of peace than war why civil feuds disturb the nation more than all our bloody wars have done before satyr is too mild a name and the design of it too good to be made use of by such a person as the poet had he desired the assistance of a bilingsgate amazon twould have been more agreeable to the matter contained in the poem for reformation is very far from his intentions since to create jealousies and uneasiness amongst us has been always the business of incendiaries like himself and if the land is discontented he is mistaken in the cause of it which probably is we have had so much money spent to support a war that some people have very little left to enjoy after a peace  fools out of favor grudge at knaves in place and men are always honest in disgrace the courtpreferments make men knaves in course but they which would be in them would be worse it is not at foreigners that we repine would foreigners their perquisites resign the grand contentions plainly to be seen to get some men put out and some put in for this our s  rs make long harangues and florid m  rs whet their polished tongues statesmen are always sick of one disease and a good pension gives them present ease that is the specific makes them all content with any king and any government good patriots at courtabuses rail and all the nations grievances bewail but when the sovereign balsams once applied the zealot never fails to change his side and when he must the golden key resign the railing spirit comes about again the parliament in general is much obliged to him for some expressions in this paragraph and mr h  in particular who i am satisfied loves his country better than any golden key whatsoever every true patriot ought to stand up for his own countrymen and if foreigners jump into posts that our civil constitutions allow natives only to be instated in it is their business as they are english representatives to take care of the peoples prerogatives they are entrusted with and if those florid members that stand up for the liberties of the people do it for the sake of a pension he passes a very odd compliment on his majesty by insinuating as much as when they are sick of the moneydistemper there is a certain court elixir which has been infallible in the cure of em  who shall this bubbld nation disabuse while they their own felicities refuse who at the wars have made such mighty pother and now are falling out with one another with needless fears the jealous nation fill and always have been saved against their will who fifty millions sterling have disbursd to be with peace and too much plenty cursed who their old monarch eagerly undo and yet uneasily obey the new search satyr search a deep incision make the poisons strong the antidotes too weak it is pointed truth must manage this dispute and downright english englishmen confute if the nations bubbled it is well for the gamesters at the other end of the town but i am a better subject than to think so i hear of no members that refuse their own felicities but are against giving away their birthright to strangers and how we come to be saved against our will it is impossible for me to conjecture when if we had not forwarded our own salvations matters would scarce have been as they now stand and our new monarch had not had the gift of our obedience had not we eagerly undone our old which is far from being an act that is involuntary but our author is as good at sense as he is at surgery when he is for making incisions instead of giving proper antidotes to repel poison  whet thy just anger at the nations pride and with keen phrase repel the vicious tide to englishmen their own beginnings show and ask them why they slight their neighbors so go back to elder times and ages past and nations into long oblivion cast to old britannias youthful days retire and there for trueborn englishmen enquire britannia freely will disown the name and hardly knows her self from whence they came wonders that they of all men should pretend to birth and blood and for a name contend go back to causes where our follies dwell and fetch the dark original from hell speak satyr for there is none like thee can tell our authors keen phrase is made ill use of in this place and the question about slighting our neighbors very improper because we dont think any of em worthy of the pr  pal  ty of wales is that any injury to em or that we repine at the gift of a blew  g  when our own noblemen go without it does that bear the face of a slight the common principle of nature persuades us to consult our own good first and he gives a small increase to the nobility of the d  ch by depretiating the original of the english who though they have underwent the common fate of other conquered countries have no lords among em that were oilmen or statesmen with coronets on their coaches that yesterday shouldered a bunch of turnips from the market  the trueborn englishman answered etc part i an english proverb where god has a church the devil has a chapel wherever god erects a house of prayer the devil always builds a chapel there and twill be found upon examination the latter has the largest congregation for ever since be first debauched the mind he made a perfect conquest of mankind with uniformity of service he reigns with a general aristocracy no nonconforming sects disturb his reign for of his yoke there is very few complain he knows the genius and the inclination and matches proper sins for every nation he needs no standingarmy government he always rules us by our own consent his laws are easy and his gentle sway makes it exceeding pleasant to obey the list of his vicegerents and commanders outdoes your caesars or your alexanders they never fail of his infernal aid and he is as certain never to be betrayed through all the world they spread his vast command and deaths eternal empires maintained they rule so politickly and so well as if they were l  j  of hell duly divided to debauch mankind and plant infernal dictates in his mind to begin with an english proverb looks very much as if our author was no great doctor at english poetry and though t  smells very much of a church with a chimney in it some roguish sort of wags will be apt to say he is one of those that plies at the devils chapel i dont mean the supposititious one which he would have the church of england go by the name of from its uniformity of service but calves head assemblies where nonconformists meet together on the  0 th of january to give glory to god for his permission in suffering the best of kings to be murdered by his subjects that day before his own palace gates  pride the first peer and president of hell to his share spain that largest province fell the subtle prince thought fittest to bestow on these the golden mines of mexico with all the silver mountains of peru wealth which would in wise hands the world undo because he knew their genius was such too lazy and too haughty to be rich so proud a people so above their fate that if reduced to beg they will beg in state lavish of money to be counted brave and proudly starve because they scorn to save never was nation in the world before so very rich and yet so very poor if pride had spain for her province ireland it is certain who had its inhabitants from thence came in for a share of it governesss favors and there must needs be a smack of it in the poet s constitution who as i have been told was a priest of that nation but how it is a wise thing to undo the world i cannot imagine unless mischief is an instance of policy and barbarity a great token of wisdom that is certain if his doctrine be true the worlds in as fair a way to be undone as a wicked man can wish if the gold of peru being in wise hands viz french refiners can make it so  lust chose the torrid zone of italy where blood ferments in rapes and sodomy where swelling veins overflow with living streams with heat impregnate from vesuvian flames whose flowing sulphur forms infernal lakes and human body of the soil partakes there nature ever burns with hot desires fanned with luxuriant air from subterranean fires here undisturbed in floods of scalding lust the infernal king reigns with infernal gust italy is indeed a hot country but some degrees cooler than the west indies which are beyond the line and placed under the torrid zone had the poet amongst his other enquiries consulted the celestial globe he would have said otherwise but it may be a mistake and probably he designed the satyr upon jamaica or barbardos which had been proper enough because so many letcherous whores and rogues have made choice of those places to reside in i have heard likewise that air has blown up and kindled a fire but never was informed before that it was the effect of fire since i am rather apt to believe it is the cause  drunkness the darling favorite of hell chose germany to rule and rules so well no subjects more obsequiously obey none please so well or are so pleased as they the cunning artist manages so well he lets them bow to heaven and drink to hell if but to wine and him they homage pay he cares not to what deity they pray what god they worship most or in what way whether by luther calvin or by rome they sail for heaven by wine he steers them home i perceive now that the spark has read heylins cosmography and taken the character of germany on trust from him but he cannot assign the same reasons for their drunkenness as he does for the italians lust since it is certain these men intemperance are no more influenced by the temperate zone which the greatest part of it lies directly under than those children of lust are affected by the torrid but if none please the devil so well as they how comes he in his virulent expressions against the english to say they are his chief favorites contradiction is a talent peculiar to himself and evil speaking altogether his own else he would not make em sail for heaven with old nick at the helm plying at the steerage or make the devil bring em all into hell notwithstanding their attempts to gain heaven by following the doctrines of luther calvin or rome an instance of our authors thoughts of the weakness of prayer and the inefficacy of any sort of devotion whatsoever  vrgovernd passion settled in france where mankind lives in haste and thrives by chance a dancing nation fickle and untrue have often undone themselves and others too prompt the infernal dictates to obey and in hells favor none more great than they just before none pleased the devil so well as the germans but now the scenes altered to france and none are more great in his favor than the people of that nation how to reconcile the superiority of em both to sense i know not no more than i do the character he gives the french men of thriving by chance when their industry is so well known as to make their misfortunes the effect of chance not the success which generally attends their endeavors in matters of trade  the pagan world be blindly leads away and personally rules with arbitrary sway the mask thrown off plain devil his title stands and what elsewhere he tempts he there commands there with full gust the ambition of his mind governs as he of old in heaven designed worshipped as god his painim altars smoke embrud with blood of those that him invoke one might have thought after he had surrendered the greatest part of christendom into satans hands he would have had some compassion on his brother infidels but however it happens he falls foul upon them too as an enemy of mankind in general and either believing the turks to be true christians or numbering them with cannibals commits an error in making them who are part of the pagan world worship the devil as god and offer humane sacrifice at his altars which is a sort of ceremony not used in the eastern countries who notwithstanding our authors boasts of an upright life making less application to the devil than his worship who seems to have a great interest with him  the rest by deputies he rules as well and plants the distant colonies of hell by them his secret power he maintains and binds the world in his infernal chains that may be but i am apt to think that he that made the world has the government of it notwithstanding satans deputy lieutenants and one would think from his planting the distant colonies of hell he was settling plantations beyond the south seas or had taken possession of some countries beyond the moguls after he had given him the dominion of all paganism but he seldom advises with his maps as will be seen by the country which comes next in play  by zeal the irish and the rush by folly fury the dane the swede by melancholy by stupid ignorance the muscovite the chinese by a child of hell called wit wealth makes the persian too effeminate and poverty the tartars desperate the turks and moors by mahmet he subdues and god has given him leave to rule the jews rage rules the portuguese and fraud the scotch revenge the pole and avarice the dutch by my shoul dear joy is much in the right to give his own country the post of honor ireland has zeal for her lord deputy forsooth when ignorance had been more proper for it as being that which is most predominant there and the swedes are tyrannically dealt with by the hypochondria a character no person that knows their way of living can justly give em if wit be a child of hell our author is certainly a child of heaven if those who have no manner of dealings with it deserve that name but what is chiefly observable in this paragraph is that the dane and portuguese are so much of the same complexion that fury rules one and rage the other which in my poor sentiments is they have the same constitution of mind a miraculous thing for certain that two nations should so sympathize when the last is so near the sun and then first so far from it  satyr be kind and draw a silent veil thy native englands vices to conceal or if that tasks impossible to do at least be just and show her virtues too too great the first alas the last too few upon my conscience he need not request his satyr to be kind it is inoffensive enough in every thing but impudence but he knows his own temper best and doubts that it is impossible for him to treat a country with any manner of humanity that has used him better than he deserved though he makes a show of exposing her virtues to balance her faults but has not the heart to do it  england unknown as yet unpeopled lay happy had she remained so to this day and not to every nation been a prey her open harbors and her fertile plains the merchants glory these and those the swains to every barbarous nation have betrayed her who conquer her as often as they invade her so beauty guarded but by innocence that ruins her which should be her defense for my part i cannot find where the happiness of england had been to have lain unpeopled when without doubt it was designed at the creation for inhabitants as well as the rest of the world neither can i imagine that person has any great skill in history who affirms that every barbarous nation that attempted to invade her gained their ends and were conquerors even rome her self the empress of the rest of the world acknowledged repulses from her and julius caesars conquering arms found a stop to em for a time by the valor of her natives  ingratitude a devil of black renown possessed her very early for his own an ugly surly sullen selfish spirit who satans worst perfections does inherit second to him in malice and in force all devil without and all within him worse if ingratitude be one of the ingredients which make up an englishman the poet has a title to be called one of the blood for treating him after such an infamous manner but it is a mystery to me how this devil of black renown could be second to satan in malice and in force when he was preferable to his sovereign lord by being much worse than him which in hell is a mark of precedence  he made her firstborn race to be so rude and suffered her to be so often subdued by several crowds of wandering thieves oerrun often unpeopld and as often undone while every nation that her powers reduced their languages and manners introduced from whose mixed relics our compounded breed by spurious generation does succeed making a race uncertain and unevn derivd from all the nations under heaven very good devilingratitude had an excellent hand at temptation if he could persuade the firstborn to be ungrateful before they had any benefactors i always took it for granted that an ill requital of kind offices fell under that name and no person could be unthankful for a courtesy before it was received but this paragraph affords the reader great choice of observations i shall only remark on as often unpeopled and as often undone and desire em to consider how that agrees with part of a foregoing paragraph that actually says the land had been happy had it remained unpeopled to this very day  the romans first with julius caesar came including all the nations of that name gauls greeks and lombards and by computation auxiliaries or slaves of every nation with hengist saxons danes with sueno came in search of plunder not in search of fame scots picts and irish from the hibernian shore and conquering william brought the normans over the romans danes and saxons that is certain conquered us but the same may be said of each of those countries the goths and vandals having broke in upon the first in such a manner as to destroy their very language and the other two fallen under the fate of vanquished kingdoms so that we have no great reason to undervalue our selves on the account of conquest when scarce a nation in all christendom has not had revolutions of the same nature but what is the greatest and most scandalous reflection he numbers the irish amongst our conquerours when it is well known that kingdom is now dependent on the english crown by the right of conquest and that they been have ever since their settlement such an inconsiderable people as our kings did not think worth while for a long time to reduce em to their present obedience  all these their barbarous offspring left behind the dregs of armies they of all mankind blended with britains who before were here of whom the welsh have blessed the character in the nonage of time there was not that distincton made betwixt man and man as there is now and when armies were undisciplined they had no swelling titles to distinguish one fellow creature from another neither is it probable that a country so inviting as he owns this to be should have only the dregs of arms for its possessors  from this amphibious illborn mob began that vain illnatured thing an englishman the customs sirnames languages and manners of all these nations are their own explainers whose relics are so lasting and so strong they have left a shiboleth upon our tongue by which with easy search you may distinguish your romansaxondanishnorman english the epithet of amphibious to people who live in an island when the sea is its defense is not so scandalous as he designed it though the title he gives our ancestors of an illborn mob sounds very hard i believe he is so little conversant in heraldry as to know nothing of their originals neither while there was a sort of equality among men has he any just excuse for lessening the pedigree of those forefathers from whence we sprung as for his finding fault with the cadence of our language i have heard from several hands he has been dabbling at an alteration of it several times to no effect and i will defy him to tell me of any modern tongue which is not made up of a compound of others as well as ours which has risen from the same cause  the great invading william the conq norman let us know what conquerors in aftertimes might do to every or archer musqueteer he brought to town he gave the lands which never were his own when first the english crown he did obtain he did not send his dutchmen home again no reassumptions in his reign were known davenant might there have let his book alone no parliament his army could disband he raised no money for he paid in land he gave his legions their eternal station and made them all freeholders of the nation he cantoned out the country to his men and every soldier was a denizen the rascals thus enriched he called them lords to please their vpstart pride with newmade words and doomsdaybook his tyranny records what parallel is there between the case of william the conqueror and that of our late revolution in his days king harold gave him battle and opposed force to force which occasioned a conquest but in our times his present majesty was received by the consent of the people invited over by the nobility and gentry and established in a throne the whole power of holland could not have placed him in without our own concurrence therefore as matters were different between the conqueror and him it was but reasonable that those who had made him king should send away the troops that came to our assistance since we had not folly enough to think they would have came to rescue us without assurance of being paid nor estates enough to spare to make a gentleman of every foot soldier six hundred thousand pound was a greater reward to the states than queen elizabeth had for saving em when they wrote themselves distressed and he might have spared the story which was more to show king william might have done the same than to disgrace the original of our nobility though what follows shows that also was intended by it  and here begins the ancient pedigree that so exalts our poor nobility it is that from some french trooper they derive who with the norman bastard did arrive the trophies of the families appear some show the sword the bow and some the spear which their great ancestor forsooth did wear these in the heralds register remain their noble mean extraction to explain yet who the hero was no man can tell whether a drummer or a colonel the silence record blushes to reveal their vndescended dark original as kings are the fountains from whence honors are derived so william the conqueror had as much right to bestow titles on his subjects as another prince has on his and if the poet was to search into some foreign noblemens families he has such an esteem for because they are not english it would be a good while before he could find either sword or bow or spear for their crest but he is a leveller and though he flatters king william is but for making one estate of the three the nation is composed of and reducing the people under the government of the people as in the year     but grant the best how came the change to pass a trueborn englishman of norman race a turkish horse can show more history to prove his welldescended family conquest as by the dr sherl de facto moderns it is expressed may give a title to the lands possessed but that the longest sword should be so civil to make a frenchman english that is the devil to answer that question it is not the blood makes an englishman but the climate and it is allowed by the civil law that whatsoever kingdom a person is born in though of foreign parents he is actually at the time of his birth a denizon of it  these are the heroes that despise the dutch and rail at newcome foreigners so much forgetting that themselves are all derived from the most scoundrel race that ever lived a horrid medly of thieves and drones who ransacked kingdoms and dispeopld towns the pict and painted britain treacherous scot by hunger theft and rapine hither brought norwegian pirates buccaneering danes whose redhaird offspring every where remains who joined with normanfrench compound the breed from whence your trueborn englishmen proceed we have no aversion for em as they are dutchmen but as they are possessed of places of trust the natives of the same country might reasonably expect to have and whatever our primitive original was the blood which gave us being having issued through so many channels might in length of time purge it self off and it is known by experience the most unclean things imaginable thrown into a running stream leave no infection behind them which makes against him if he allows the circulation of the blood which i believe notwithstanding all his equivocations he cannot deny  and lest by length of time it be pretended the climate may this modern breed have mended wise providence to keep us where we are mixes us daily with exceeding care we have been europes sink the jakes where she voids all her offal outcast progeny from our fifth henrys time the strolling bands of banished fugitives from neighboring lands have here a certain sanctuary found the eternal refuge of the vagabond wherein but half a common age of time borrwing new blood and manners from the clime proudly they learn all mankind to contemn and all their race are trueborn englishmen here he seems to be apprehensive of the argument that was made use of against his last and to fence it off guards himself with a known untruth henry the fifth a prince of the greatest honor imaginable after his accession to the throne is made to countenance vagabonds and banished fugitives when there are many instances to the contrary if he will take the trouble upon him to read his life but were it actually as he would have it it was always reckoned no small reputation for a kingdom to be a sanctuary to the distressed and a refuge to poor people who possibly might have other reasons for flying from the land of their nativity than the crimes he seems to charge em with  dutch walloons flemings irishmen and scots vaudois and valtolins and hugonots in good queen besss charitable reign supplied us with three hundred thousand men religion god we thank thee sent them hither priests protestants the devil and all together of all professions and of every trade all that were persecuted or afraid whether for debt or other crimes they fled david at hackelah was still their head this paragraph being much of the same nature with the former and written to reproach the memory of the best of queens after he had too hastily shot his bolt against the most glorious of our kings i shall jump over the repeated crambe he tires the reader with to take notice of his expression god we thank thee full of as much impiety as could come from an atheists mouth and one who denies all manner of revealed religion he could have uttered forth no worse complaints against the goodness of that infinite being had he said god you are only to be blamed for putting such whims in the fools as the notions of religion and instilling into their empty skulls the fears of offending an incensed deity which has forced them to quit their own country and lie a rentcharge on our hands which is downright blasphemy or nothing can deserve that name  the offspring of this miscellaneous crowd had not their new plantations long enjoyed but they grew englishmen and raised their votes at foreign shoals of interloping scots the king jam   royal branch from pictland did succeed with troops of scots and scabs from northbytweed the seven first years of his pacifick reign made him and half his nation englishmen scots from the northern frozen banks of tay with packs and plods came whigging all away thick as the locusts which in egypt swarmed with pride and hungry hopes completely armed with native truth diseases and no money plundered our canaan of the milk and honey here they grew quickly lords and gentlemen and all their race are truebornenglishmen and what could hinder them from deserving the name if they were born in england since they were obliged to perform all the offices of trueborn englishmen where is the hurt to give them the title of such k james the ii was an excellent prince and his subjects were truly happy under his reign which he by way of ridicule calls pacifick and we cannot deny but several families of scots came with him into england but it is worth his observation to take notice that his chiefest favorite was an englishman notwithstanding his affection to his own nation  the civil wars the common purgative which always use to make the nation thrive made way for all that strolling congregation which thronged in king cha ii pious ch  ss restoration the royal refugee our breed restores with foreign courtiers and with foreign whores and carefully repeopled us again throught his lazy long lascivious reign with such a blessed and trueborn english fry as much illustrates our nobility a gratitude which will so black appear as future ages must abhor to hear when they look back on all that crimson flood which streamed in lindseys and caernarvons blood bold strafford cambridge capel lucas lisle who crowned in death his fathers funeral pile the loss of whom in order to supply with trueborn english nobility six bastard dukes survive his luscious reign the labors of italian c    n french p    h tabby s   t and cambrian besides the numerous bright and virgin throng whose female glories shade them from my song it is but an odd sort of an observation that countries thrive by civil wars since it is evident that where the seat of a war is the trade of that people is at a stand and had not that injured prince whom he for want of due respect to his memory brands with the name of a refugee been forced by rebellious subjects from the land of his inheritance he would have had no obligations to return to foreign courts but a party which our author glories in being a member of having been the occasion of his exile we may thank them if he was withdrawn from a due exercise of those admirable parts he was the happy master of and when he was possessor of a genius the fittest that could be for business that he gave himself up too much to his pleasures the same reason that persuaded him to a due respect of his late majestys natural daughters might have with held him from abusing his princely sons some of which have been and are a pattern of true behavior to the english court but where manners are not they cannot be expected  this offspring if one age they multiply may half the house with english peers supply there with true english pride they may contemn s    g and p   d newmade noblemen if we had no worse sort of gentlemen amongst our english nobility we need not care how many we had of the breed no disparagement to s    g and p    d his new made noblemen  french cooks scotch pedlars and italian whores were all made lords or lords progenitors beggars and bastards by his new creation much multiplied the peerage of the nation who will be all ever one short age runs over as trueborn lords as those we had before these six lines should have been explained if he would have any body know the meaning of them for i am well assured no french cooks or scotch pedlars were ever made noblemen in the kings reign whose ashes he disturbs so basely and for the italian whores he makes mention of they might possibly have been made ladies though i never heard the duchess of mazarine had any english title conferred on her but if he is not abandoned to the want of sense as well as good manners he must agree with me their sex would not permit them to be made lords  then to recruit the commons he prepares and heal the latent breaches of the wars the pious purpose better to advance h invites the banished protestants of france hither for gods sake and their own they fled some for religion came and some for bread two hundred thousand pair of wooden shoes who god be thanked had nothing left to lose to heavens great praise did for religion fly to make us starve our poor in charity in every port they plant their fruitful train to get a race of trueborn englishmen whose children will when riper years they see be as illnatured and as proud as we call themselves english foreigners despise be surly like us all and just as wise had our author any sense of shame or christianity in him he would never blame a prince for an action that has rendered his name famous in all the courts of europe when the professors of christs holy gospel were expelled from the place of their nativity he received them  omnium egenos vrbe domo daeos and more than imitated the queen of carthages noble saying of non ignora mali miseris succurrere disco he had been hospitably dealt with himself by the same people whose princes persecuting genius flung them upon his protection and if there had been two millions instead of two hundred thousand his name ought to be had in everlasting remembrance since to feed the hungry and cloth the naked is so far from the transgression of a duty that it is an actual performance of our saviors command  thus from a mixture of all kinds began that hetrogeneous thing an englishman in eager rapes and furious lust begot betwixt a painted britain and a scot whose gendring offspring quickly learnt to bow and yoke their heifers to the roman plough from whence a mongrel halfbred race there came with neither name nor nation speech or fame infused betwixt a saxon and a dane while their rank daughters to their parents just received all nations with promiscuous lust this nauseous brood directly did contain the wellextracted blood of englishmen the word thus seems to intimate we englishmen had our original from the french refugees who have been admitted into the kingdom these last thirty years for no persecution began in charles the seconds reign before but the poet being not very good at connection and unsatisfied with abusing us in the same nature before falls again into the very same malicious account of our primitive rise on purpose to whet our memory and stamp impressions on it of his great civilities that we might think of suitable returns  which medly cantoned in a heptarchy a rhapsody of nations to supply among themselves maintained eternal wars and still the ladies loved the conquerors it seems there were ladies in the time of the heptarchy though he allows of no such things as lords before william the conqueror but though he seems to have a respect for the fair sex by the title he gives em he deserves to lose much of their esteem if he ever had any of it for the character he gave the women in those times of being mercenary and in love with the strongest side  the westernangles all the rest subdued a bloody nation barbarous and rude who by the tenure of the sword possessed one part of britain and subdued the rest and as great things denominate the small the conquering part gave title to the whole the scot pict britain dane submit and with the englishsaxon all unite and these the mixture have so close pursued the very name and memorys subdued no roman now no britain does remain wales strove to separate but strove in vain the silent nations undistingushd fall and englishmans the common name for all fate jumbld them together god knows how whatever they were they are trueborn english now we have had as much before in good honest prose which has more beauties in it than his lamentable verse that the westernangles conquered the rest but the parts which were conquered as the east angles etc helped to give the whole country the name of england as well as that which had subdued em which shows the poet lies under a mistake and is guilty of some escapes in matters of history but what deserves our notice more particularly is his making the conquerors who were inhabitants of the western parts bloody barbarous and rude when it is apparent in our chronicles those of the north were the most cruel on purpose to taint the nation in general which had submitted to the conquest of those inhumane people with the said vices  the wonder which remains is at our pride to value that which all wise men deride for englishmen to boast of generation cancels their knowledge and lampoons the nation a trueborn englishmans a contradiction in speech an irony in fact a fiction a banter made to be a test of fools which those that use it justly ridicules a metaphor invented to express a man akin to all the universe pride was wholly attributed to the spaniards sometime before but now it is the property of the english either his memory is very treacherous or he has been so lavish of the vices he has charged us with that he is forced to have recourse to those he has flung upon others because of the lowness of his stock and if we are akin to all the universe we have a multitude of noble relations for certain which renders us above the common dregs of all mankind without any manner of question  for as the scots as learned men have said throughout the world their wandering seed have spread so openhanded england it is believed has all the gleaning of the world received the traveling of the scots is an argument of their enquiries after knowledge a virtue for which they are unreproachable therefore our author does very ill to make use of cleavelands word wandering unless he had been gifted with cleavelands wit but how he can prove that england has received all the gleanings of the world unless he can make appear we had any forefathers from japan and china i cannot imagine  some think of england twas our savior meant the gospel should to all the world be sent since when the blessed sound did hither reach they to all nations might be said to preach though he pretends to make out our original he is more than presumptious to explain our saviors doctine after that manner i am apt to think those are no ones sentiments but his own and notwithstanding the dangerous opinion he has of no such person in the blessed trinity no man that has the name of a christian but will conclude that christs predictions will be fullfilld without any such mean evasion as he impiously lays hold on  it is well that virtue gives nobility else god knows where we had our gentry since scarce one family is left alive which does not from some foreigner derive of sixty thousand english gentlemen whose names and arms in registers remain we challenge all our heralds to declare ten families which englishsaxons are it is well to use his own words he will acknowledge any such thing as virtue to be amongst us it is a condescension he has not before been guilty of and if we have sixty thousand english gentlemen it is no matter whether they are derived from the saxons or no since we had people that have conquered us of as great antiquity as them  france justly boasts the ancient noble line of bourbon mommorency and lorrain the germans too the house of austria show and holland their invincible nassau lines which in heraldry were ancient grown before the name of englishman was known even scotland too her elder glory shows her gourdons hamiltons and her monroes douglas mackays and grahams names well known long before ancient england knew her own france and both the germanys high and low have changed their masters as often as us and though they have great swelling names some of our families may be no more obscure than theirs since we have the same reasons to boast of their antiquity and our poetaster had paid never the less difference to the invincible nassau had he placed his grandfathers family  viz that of the stewarts which is the most ancient in scotland before that of monroe which i never heard was famous for any member of it but one mr monroe who is a celebrated tobaconist  but england modern to the last degree borrows or makes her own nobility and yet she boldly boasts of pedigree repines that foreigners are put upon her and talks of her antiquity and honor her s  lls s  ls c  ls de  m  rs m  ns and m  ues d  s and v  rs not one have english names yet all are english your h  ns p  llons and l  liers pass now for trueborn english knights and squires peers and make good senatemembers or lordmayors wealth howsoever got in england makes lords of mechanics gentlemen of rakes antiquity and birth are needless here it is impudence and money makes a p  r the names may be french on account of the norman invasion but it is the title that makes the nobleman which cannot be said to be borrowed if the kings of england could not make their own peers they would have less prerogative than the meanest sovereign princes who have a right to multiply the number of em as they please and if impudence and money make a peer in these days he has made a pretty sort of a complement to his present majesty whom we shall find he has written a most bombast harangue in verse upon and been after his laudable custom exceeding civil to the duke and earl whom he would have preferable to king charles the seconds sons  innumerable cityknights we know from blewcoat hospitals and bridewell flow draymen and porters fill the city chair and footboys magisterial purple wear fate has but very small dictinction set betwixt the counter and the coronet tarpaulin lords pages of high renown rise up by poor mens valor not their own great families of yesterday we show and lords whose parents were the lord knows who it is a sign when people rise in the world and make a figure from small beginnings industry has had a great hand in their promotion and when people of indifferent circumstances are advanced to honor there is an encouragement of virtue going forward the common seamans labors may do much toward the gaining a naval victory but it is the admirals conduct that brings it to pass and though english pages for their bravery at sea are made lords it is not a thing to be wondered at since a certain gentleman belonging to a nation he is so fond of has had more than the same honor done him for none of those performances  part ii the breeds described now satyr if you can their temper show for manners makes the man fierce as the britain as the roman brave and less inclined to conquer than to save eager to fight and lavish of their blood and equally of fear and forecast void the pict has made em sour the dane morose false from the scot and from the norman worse what honesty they have the saxon gave them and that now they grow old begins to leave them the climate makes them terrible and bold and english beef their courage does uphold no danger can their daring spirit pall always provided that their bellys full this paragraph makes our author look like a roman himself though he will allow none of us to be any thing like them when they have left their brood behind them without doubt as well as any of our other conquerors and he seems like janus to carry his head two ways one while he commends us for our valor another rails against us for our falsehood he names the nations that bequeathed us the vices he makes mention of and for our stock of honesty because he would make it as small as he could the saxons forsooth above all other people must be our benefactors in leaving us that a valuable sort of gift indeed when according to his challenge out of  0000 families ten of them had not so much as a drop of their blood in them  in close intriegues their facultys but weak for genrally whatever they know they speak and often their own councils undermine by their infirmity and not design from whence the learned say it does proceed that english treasons never can succeed for they are so openhearted you may know their own most secret thoughts and others too if the english betray the secrets that are committed to them by infirmity not by any design it is as plain as the nose in his face they are honest which contradicts the character he gave of them in the foregoing paragraph and as that implies a contradiction to sense so the character he gives them of having faculties too weak for intriegues is a downright contradiction to truth since we have statesmen now in being and englishmen too not inferior to the richlieus and mazarines of france or to any hard names whatsoever the dutch are distinguished by and it is beyond all manner of doubt certainly true that the last might have been glad to have got back to the texel again had not some wise gentlemen that lived near the names laid their heads together in order to forward the happy revolution they boast of  the laboring poor in spite of double pay are saucy mutinous and beggarly so lavish of their money and their time that want of forecast is the nations crime good drunken company is their delight and what they get by day they spend by night dull thinking seldom does their heads engage but drink their youth away and hurry on old age empty of all good husbandry and sense and void of manners most when void of pence their strong aversion to behaviours such they always talk too little or too much so dull they never take the pains to think and seldom are goodnatured but in drink he is almanzorlike for killing all and making a complete victory over the whole english race the nobility and gentry have had a taste of his fury and he will be impartial and fall upon the poor also when if they were so lavish of their money and time as he would persuade us they are few of them would come to wear gold chains which he blames them for or show their charity in magisterial purple which has been such a mortification to him and if they had not given themselves time to think they would never have arrived at  in english ale their dear enjoyment lies for which they will starve themselves and families an englishman will fairly drink as much as will maintain two families of dutch subjecting all their labors to the pots the greatest artists are the greatest sots i never heard but the dutch were as good tosspots as our selves though he would have us believe one englishman can drink as much as will maintain two families of em however he has made amends for that known lie by giving his assent to a known truth which is that we are more dextrous at business than them and are the greatest artists by consequence since he has the ill manners to call us the greatest sots  the country poor do by example live the gentry lead them and the clergy drive what may we not from such examples hope the landlord is their god the priest their pope a drunken clergy and a swearing bench has given the reformation such a drench as wise men think there is some cause to doubt will purge good manners and religion out the way to abolish religion which has been the main design of our author is to make the clergy look little in the eyes of the laity and he has laid hold of effectual means to further his intentions nothing being more capable to draw the people from the respect which is due to them so much as the imputation of drunkenness unless they open their eyes and examine into the character of him that charges them with it but god be thanked we have the soberest clergy in the world our ministers are men of exemplary lives as well as great learning and our gentrys tenants are so far from standing in such a reverential awe of their landlords that they are gentlemen themselves in respect of the boors beyond sea  nor do the poor alone their liquor prize the sages join in this great sacrifice the learned men who study aristotle correct him with an explanationbottle praise epicurus rather than lysander and the drunkards name for canary aristippus more than alexander the doctors too their galen here resign and genrally prescribe specific wine the graduates studys grown an easier task while for the urinal they toss the flask the surgeons art grows plainer every hour and wines the balm which into wounds they pour the reason he has for pecking at our universities is because the vice chancellor of one of them civilly desired him to withdraw himself from it for fear of his corrupting young gentlemenstudents morals which he had an excellent talent at otherwise common justice would have forced him to own there are the most excellent scholars in them which are to be found in any place of learning throughout all europe and the statutes are so regularly put in force against all manner of licentiousness that he has no manner of excuse for the scandal he charges them with english physicians also are men of the best reputation in that faculty throughout the whole universe and to speak against our practitioners dexterity in surgery is to give the lie to demonstration and vent a known falsehood in the room of that which is true  poets long since parnassus have forsaken and say the ancient bards were all mistaken apollos lately abdicate and fled and good king bacchus reigns in his stead he does the chaos of the head refine and atomthoughts jump into words by wine the inspirations of a finer nature as wine must needs excel parnassus water one may perceive by his hungry insipid lines he is a fresh water poet and that wine is very far from having any such thing as inspiration in it if he makes use of it that is for certain apollo would abdicate if he was in danger of having good sense and verse murdered by the rest of his subjects as he has done and helicon would be soon drunk up were the rest of the fraternity troubled so much with the heartburning as he is but your man of verse knows better that would acquire fame by his writings and to perpetuate his memory like one of his predecessors always goes  been potus ad arma  statesmen their weighty politics refine and soldiers raise their courages by wine caecilia gives her choristers their choice and lets them all drink wine to clear the voice as for our statesmen without question the making their heads hot is not the way to make their thoughts sedate and cool and it is evident from the success of their counsels our author is no great politician himself it is apparent also he is no songster since he understands the customs of singingmen so little as to make them drink when liquors are the most pernicious things to a good voice and the likeliest imaginable to take their livelihood from em  some think the clergy first found out the way and wines the only spirit by which they pray but other less profane than so agree it clears the lungs and helps the memory and therefore all of them divinely think instead of study it is as well to drink for certain he is not one of the less profane by the wicked expressions that come from him and seems to agree with the belief of the jews who said the apostles were drunk with new wine when they declaring the message of the most high god so that the reader may find what sect he belongs to since he is against the response of with thy spirit let us pray  and here i would be very glad to know whether our asgilites may drink or no the enlightning fumes of wine would certainly assist them much when they begin to fly or if a fierychariot should appear inflamed by wine they would have the less to fear he is resolved to pull every body in by the neck and shoulders and mr asgil is mauled off next for his notion of translation but in such a manner that any man would deserve the name of a wise one that could find out where the satyr bit he asks a question and answers it himself for if it would give wings to asgels disciples and guard em from the fear of death without doubt mr asgil would not forbid em the use of a liquor which would be very instrumental in forwarding their translation  even the gods themselves as mortals say were they on earth would be as drunk as they nectar would be no more celestial drink they would all take wine to teach them how to think but english drunkards gods and men outdo drink their estates away and senses too colons in debt and if his friends should fail to help him out must die at last in gaol his wealthy uncle sent a hundred nobles to pay his trifles off and rid him of his troubles but colon like a trueborn englishman drank all the money out in bright champaign and colon does in custody remain drunkness has been the darling of the realm ever since a drunken pilot had the helm what he brings the gods in for is a secret to me unless he would show he has read poetry though he is master of none of the beauties of it and whom he means by colon i cannot tell but if it be any particular person he points his harmless satyr at it is foreign to the purpose since he designs it as a reflection against the english in general for though there may be a colon or two or many more in the nation he has no authority to infer from thence that drunkenness is the darling vice in it or to show the partiality of his spleen if it were so by dating it from the reign of a prince whom he had before rendered infamous for a vice which is not consistent with it  in their religion they are so unevn that each man goes his own byway to heaven tenacious of mistakes to that degree that every man pursues it seprately and fancies none can find the way but he so shy of one another they are grown as if they strove to get to heaven alone rigid and zealous positive and grave and every grace but charity they have this makes them so illnatured and uncivil that all men think an englishman the devil any one may perceive he is for voting an act of comprehension and that he would all have the the straggling sects whatsoever enjoy the same privileges with those that are actually in common with the established church though by his saying they are tenacious of mistakes he seems to conclude every different sort of religion practiced in these realms is false and none but the fantastical schemes he proposes to us as matters of faith true  surly to strangers froward to their friend submit to love with a reluctant mind resolved to be ungrateful and unkind if by necessity reduced to ask the giver has the difficultest task for what is bestowed they awkwardly receive and always take less freely than they give the obligation is their highest grief and never love where they accept relief so sullen in their sorrows that it is known they will rather die than their afflictions own and if relieved it is too often true that they will abuse their benefactors too for in distress their haughty stomachs such they hate to see themselves obliged too much seldom contented often in the wrong hard to be pleased at all and never long as for the character he gives us in the beginning of this paragraph it is so inconsistent with an english temper that he needs nothing but his own words to refute him and if we take less freely than we give it is a plain argument against that lowness of birth he would tax us with and shows our generosity to be such that we take more pleasure in having our own beneficences accepted than to give our acceptance of those of others which is so far from any thing that tends to our disparagement that it is a virtue we ought to be prized above our neighbors for and an excellence of that uncommon nature that makes us superior to the rest of those nations that people the world  if your mistakes their ill opinion gain no merit can their favor reobtain and if they are not vindictive in their fury it is their unconstant temper does secure ye their brains so cool their passion seldom burns for all is condensed before the flame returns the fermentations of so weak a matter the humid damps the fume and runs it all to water so though the inclination may be strong they are pleased by fits and never angry long if we are inconstant in our temper we should certainly by the frequent changes it is guilty of sometime or other fall into a vindictive fury and resent affronts which are put upon us but if we are such strangers to passion what amurrain is become of the danish fury and the porteguese rage which he not long since said had such an ascendant over us and for the humid to damp the fume he might have as well said one moist thing adds moistness to another which proceeds from no antipathy of one different quality to another as he ignorantly would have it  then if good nature shows some slender proof they never think they have reward enough but like our modern quakers of the town expect your manners and return you none the last distich agrees very little with the first and i find he is overhappy in making similitudes for if we are the benefactors which he calls a slender proof of good nature it is our business to receive acknowledgments and not return em before any such thing is paid us  friendship the abstracted union of the mind which all men seek but very few can find of all the nations in the universe none talk on it more or understand it less for if it does their property annoy their property their friendship will destroy as i take it friendship is the union of two distinct minds and not of one neither is it an abstract of agreement which is a sort of an epitome of happiness but an entire perfect and complete enjoyment betwixt one soul and another and if we were so unhappy as to deserve the character he gives since very few nations are masters of this friendship we have this comfort as to have a great many countries and amongst them perhaps his beloved dutchland who share with us in the want of it  as you discourse them you shall hear them tell all things in which they think they do excel no panegyric needs their praise record an englishman never wants his own good word his first discourses genrally appear prologud with his own wondrous character when to illustrate his own good name he never fails his neighbor to defame and yet he really designs no wrong his malice goes no further than his tongue but pleased to tattle he delights to rail to satisfy the lechry of a tale his own dear praises close the ample speech tells you how wise he is that is how rich for wealth is wisdom he that is rich is wise and all men learned poverty despise his generosity comes next and then concludes that he is a trueborn englishman and they it is known are generous and free forgetting and forgiving injury which may be true thus rightly understood forgiving ill turns and forgetting good were our author an englishman as he would persuade us he is he would have contradicted himself in this point and been so far from giving himself his own good word that he would have shown he had picked out the worst he could find in the whole english vocabulary but he is more partial than so and being of another nation flings all the dirt that is possible upon us though i dare swear he is in the wrong for charging our rich natives with boasting of their riches since it is manifest there is no people in the universe that are more cautious of having their wealth known than the generality of ours witness the numbers in this kingdom that are possessed of vast sums and yet would have the world believe nothing like it as for our forgiving ill turns we thank him for the character and take it for our own being in hopes he will apply that of forgetting good to himself since he has been so unthankful for the favors he has received here and so ungenerous as to return the mercy of a nation who might have handed him very severely for his impious writings with so barbarous a treatment  cheerful in labor when they have undertook it but out of humor when they are out of pocket but if their belly and their pockets full they may be phlegmatic but never dull and if a bottle does their brains refine it makes their wit as sparkling as their wine his satyr now bears the countenance of panegyric and he has taken off the scandal he before fastened on us of being a lazy people by putting that of our being cheerful in labor in its room and if a bottle refines our brains and gives a spirituous influence to our wit it very much makes against his side who has blamed us for diverting our selves over it  as for the general vices which we find they are guilty of in common with mankind satyr forbear and silently endure we must conceal the crimes we cannot cure nor shall my verse the brighter sex defame for english beauty will preserve her name beyond dispute agreeable and fair and modester than other nations are for where the vice prevails the great temptation is want of money more than inclination in general this only is allowed they are something noisy and a little proud we have all manner of reason to thank him for his great condescension in being graciously pleased to show his compassion in concealing our vices after he has charged us with all the devil could put in his head and if he must not divulge the crimes he cannot cure he has already broke through that prohibition by making mention of so much as one single fault since very few patients will accept of a cure where oldnick is known to be the doctor as for the ladies they are in his favor though i question whether he will be in theirs since to make them noisy and proud is enough to put them out of humor  an englishman is gentlest in command obedience is a stranger in the land hardly subjected to the magistrate for englishmen do all subjection hate humblest when rich but peevish when they are poor and think whatever they have they merit more if an englishman is gentle in command and does not curb in those who are put under him with too stiff a rein he is certainly praiseworthy and is deservedly had in esteem but if obedience be a stranger in the land how comes it about that his present majesty is owned as such throughout all the three kingdoms to be humblest when rich is also a certain token of an innate goodness but to reconcile what follows with it is beyond my ability since if their increase of wealth is an increase of their humility they can never be unsatisfied and think they merit more  shamwhig pretends to have served the government but balked of due reward turns malecontent for english christians always have regard to future recompenses of reward his forfeit liberty they did restore and gave him bread which he had not before but trueborn english shamwig lets them know his merit must not lie neglected so as proud as poor his masters he will defy and writes a piteous satyr in praise of folly and knavery satyr upon honesty some think the poem had been pretty good if he the subject had but understood he got five hundred pence by this and more as sure as he had never a groat before to call tutchin a shamwig is directly to affirm he has not half the ill qualities of a whig as he would have him for my part i must own i think he has the particular characteristic of that rebellious and whining sect if a murmuring genius and an unsatisfied temper can point him out as a member of so scandalous a society but how two such brothers in iniquity who so directly tally in every thing but their opinion about foreigners should fall out that is a riddle to me every body knows tutchin was deservedly ordered to be whipped through the west country market towns and that he was set at liberty and entertained by some people of no small note after the revolution and how that he like a true whig and villain afterward abused his benefactors by writing a satyr in praise of folly and knavery incomparably better then his trueborn englishman but i never could hear any body say tutchin was worse then t  d  in business next some friends of his employed him and there he proved that fame had not belied him his benefactors quickly he abused and falsely to the government accused but they defended by their innocence ruined the traitor in their own defense this is also a truth which he has picked out of the reverse which was an answer to the foreigners and which as i take it intimates he had a place given him at the victuallingoffice but accusing the commissioners before the lords of the admiralty and not able to make out what he charged em with he himself was divested of his own post by this the author may perceive i am not so bad and so abandoned to wickededness as to be a friend of tutchins neither have i so little judgment as to have a good opinion of the person who rails at him  thus kicked about from pillars unto posts he whets his pen against the lord of hosts burlesques his god and king in paltry rhimes against the dutch turns champion for the times and huffs the king upon that very score on which he panegyrickd him before it is natural for men of both their kidneys to change sides as occasion offers and if tutchins design in writing the foreigners was only for the good of his nation he was far enough from huffing the king who is an english prince since he reigns over us by taking part with the english who are the subjects that have stood by him with their lives and fortunes and lost abundance of treasure in his defense when the dutch have been gainers by the war  unhappy england have thou none but such to plead thy scoundrel cause against the dutch this moves their scorn and not their indignation he that lampoons the dutch burlesques the nation if englands be a scoundrel cause for gods sake what must that of holland be and if we move their scorn it is our own fault since we have had it in our power to command their fear and might have lampoond the dutch without burlesquing the nation had we been so wise as to have less dealings with em  the meanest english ploughman studies law and keeps thereby the magistrates in awe will boldly tell them what they ought to do and sometimes punish their omissions too certainly he has been in wales or yorkshire by the character he gives the ploughmen and the gentlemen of the long robe have no reason to thank him for casting such a reflection on the study of the law for their part those are wise magistrates indeed that are kept in awe by em and for mine i have never heard of any such but one cityjustice and he has a shoemaker to read law to him  their liberty and propertys so dear they scorn their laws or governors to fear so bugbeard with the name of slavery they cannot submit to their own liberty restraint from ill is freedom to the wise but englishmen do all restraint despise slaves to the liquor drudges to the pots the mob are statesmen and their statesmen sots if he blames us for our liberty and property being dear to us he cannot be a friend to the late revolution which he would be taken for a champion of and he would do well to explain his unintelligible assertion of our not being able to submit to our own liberty the next two lines are applicable to no englishmen but those of his own persuasion and the contents of em put in practice by no sort of persons but those who are under a perpetual uneasiness and have the impudence to call our statesmen sots which reflects upon the wisdom of him that made choice of em  their governors they count such dangerous things that it is their custom to affront their kings so jealous of the power their kings possessed they suffer neither power nor kings to rest the bad with force they eagerly subdue the good with constant clamours they pursue and did king jesus reign they would murmur too a discontented nation and by far harder to rule in times of peace than war easily set together by the ears and full of causeless jealousies and fears apt to revolt and willing to rebel and never are contented when they are well no government could ever please them long could tie their hands or rectify their tongue in this to ancient israel well compared eternal murmurs are among them heard he goes on with the known qualities of his own sect and being seemingly ashamed of owning em himself flings em on those who have no manner of relation to em he acknowledges there are but too many of this temper in this kingdom and that rebellion dissatisfaction and the other crimes he falsely charges us with has a multitude of disciples ready to side with either of em but let us seek for the fountain which gives being to this sea of wickedness and which for other causes then the river nile hides its head and we shall soon find the source of those mischiefs that are our perpetual disturbers is on that side which he is the ungrateful defender of  it was but lately that they were oppressed their rights invaded and their laws suppressed when nicely tender of their liberty lord what a noise they made of slavery in daily tumults showed their discontent lampoond their king and mockd his government and if in arms they did not first appear twas want of force and not for want of fear in humbler tone than english usd to do at foreign hands for foreign aid they sue and where was the harm to think our selves injured if we really were and to complain of grievances if we had a just cause for it king james was led aside and we did not make our addresses to the dutch who treading in wrong paths themselves could not set his majesty in the right but sent our remonstrances over to the princess and prince of orange in order to let them know whose principal concern it was that they had a jealousy there was no fair play going forward at the english court they addressed them in no humbler tone than was fitting to be made use of to princes of their high birth and invited their highnesses to england not so much for want of force but because it was necessary that the persons whose concern it was to examine into the p  of wales his birth should be at the head of them to countenance what otherwise would have born the face of a rebellion  william the great successor of nassau their prayers heard and their oppressions saw he saw and saved them god and him they praised to this their thanks to that their trophies raised but glutted with their own felicities they soon their new deliverer despise say all their prayers back their joy disown vnsing their thanks and pull their trophies down their harp of praise are on the willows hung for englishmen are never contented long it is not our business to question what he says on his majestys part and he says nothing on the part of the people but what is true since they gave their deliverer no other thanks than those he deserved but it is the greatest of falsehoods to say we soon despised him when if any sect of people were guilty of that piece of ingratitude those that call themselves dissenters are the persons who are not satisfied of having a free exercise of their religion according to the dictates of their conscience but will murmur on till theirs is the established faith and their meetings have the same royal authority in their behalf as the kirk of scotland which i presume from his majestys great knowledge of the churchof england loyalty will never come to pass  the reverend clergy too and whod have thought that they who had such nonresistance taught should ever to arms against their prince be brought who up to heaven did regal power advance subjecting english laws to modes of france twisting religion so with loyalty as one could never live and the other dye and yet no sooner did their prince design their glebes and perquisites to undermine but all their passivedoctrines laid aside the clergy their own principles denied vnpreachd their nonresisting cant and prayed to heaven for help and to the dutch for aid the church chimd all her doctrines back again and pulpitchampions did the cause maintain flew in the face of all their former zeal and nonresistance did at once repeal nonresistance in things that are lawful was the doctrine of our church and the greatest part of our clergy preached up passive obedience only where their prince did not violate the rights of his subjects a great number of them i am well assured would have suffered the greatest extremities for the sake of their religion though when the church lands were called in question and the possessors of them were likely to be forced from them then judgment began at the house of god and a certain timeserver who is in his partys interest and lives not a mile from the temple cut asunder the gordian knot which he had before made indissoluble which does not at all affect the churchof england loyalty since that fulsome harangemaker is looked upon as one of its rotten members  the rabbis say it would be too prolix to tie religion up to politics the churchs safety is suprema lex and so by a new figure of their own do all their former doctrines disown as laws post facto in the parliament in urgent cases having obtained assent but are as dangerous presidents laid by made lawful only by necessity the safety of the church is the preservation of the laws and as the infringement of the privileges of the one is a downright violation of the other so unless the authority of religion be kept up and the ministers of gods holy ordinances had in reverence the statutes of the kingdom will be but an ill fence to restrain the violence of licentious men who will break in upon the other laws after they have destroyed that which is their fundamental  the reverend fathers then in arms appear and men of god became the men of war the nation fird by them to arms apply assault their antichristian monarchy to their due channel all our laws restore and made things what they should have been been before but when they came to fill the vacant throne and the pale priests looked back on what they had done how english liberty began to thrive and churchof england loyalty outlive how all their persecuting days were done and their delivrer placed upon the throne the priests as priests are wont to do turned tail they are englishmen and nature will prevail now they deplore the ruins they have made and murmur for the master they betrayed excuse those crimes they could not make him mend and suffer for the cause they cannot defend pretend they would not have carried things so high and protomartyrs make for popery the reflection which he designs upon the lord bishop of london for none of our other fathers in god took arms on that occasion is of so little force that his lordship has nothing to fear from it his lordship was suspended by an ecclesiastical high court which was unlawfully established was under apprehensions of suffering every day worse and worse and had every misfortune to provide himself against that either a subject or a christian ought to stand in fear of and therefore is very much to be excused though i dont vindicate taking arms against a sovereign but the priests whom he joins the epithet of pale to meaning the nonjurants are falsely traduced they gave no more assistance to the then prince of orange than their prayers for his success and their continued vows to the almighty to crown an undertaking for the sake of religion with an happy issue and notwithstanding they were men of such tender consciences as not to be led by any hopes of gain to take oaths to a prince who was established in the throne during the life of the king they had sworn to i am well persuaded they are so far from turning martyrs for popery that no people whatsoever are more against that idolatrous opinion than themselves  had the prince done as they designed the thing have set the clergy up to rule the king taken a donative for coming hither and so have left their king and them together we had say they been now a happy nation no doubt we had seen a blessed reformation for wise men say ts as dangerous a thing a ruling priesthood as a priestrid king and of all plagues with which mankind are cursed ecclesiastic tyrannys the worst it was not only the priests thoughts that his present majesty would have settled affairs on their ancient establishment and been contented with the glory of rescuing three nations from propery and slavery but his majestys own intentions as may be seen in his declaration in the year      was agreeable to their thoughts till the parliament was so importunate with him to accept the three that he could not have refused them without leaving the people he had freed to the same dangers they were before exposed to  if all our former grievances were feigned king james has been abused and we trepanned bugbeard with popery and power despotick tyrannick government and leagues exotic the revolutions a phanatick plot w  a tyrant s  a sot a factious army and a poisoned nation unjustly forced king jamess abdication no true protestant i am persuaded believes our grievances were feigned but is heartily glad they are redressed however though i have a greater veneration for the person and merit of w  than to say he is a ty  nt i am ready to affirm one s  as i know perhaps not the person he means guilty of a greater crime than sottishness for betraying so kind a master  but if he did the subjects rights invade then he was punished only not betrayed and punishing of kings is no such crime but englishmen have done it many a time i must needs acknowledge i dont understand the doctrine of punishing kings though the murder of good king charles has been such a barbarous instance of it that if divine punishment does not overtake the authors of it certainly there is no vengeance in store for the vilest offenders  when kings the sword of justice first lay down they are no kings though they possess the crown titles are shadows crowns are empty things the good of subjects is the end of kings to guide in war and to protect in peace where tyrants once commence the kings do cease for arbitrary powers so strange a thing it makes the tyrant and unmakes the king if kings by foreign priests and armies reign and lawless power against their oaths maintain then subjects must have reason to complain if oaths must bind us when our kings do ill to call in foreign aid is to rebel by force to circumscribe our lawful prince is wilful treason in the largest sense and they who once rebel most certainly their god and king and former oaths defy if we allow no maladministration could cancel the allegiance of the nation let all our learned sons of levi try this ecclesastick riddle to unty how they could make a step to call the prince and yet pretend to oaths and innocence if i mistake not the two first lines in this paragraph are not clear from exceptions for according to the rules of common sense whether a king reigns justly or unjustly he is nevertheless a king beyond all dispute while he sits upon the throne but great disputants are sometimes out in their consequences therefore i shall skip over the rest of his argument as what is heard every day over coffee and tea and examine into the last verses which seem to bear all the strength of reason he is capable of mustring up if we may call a person to the relief of a kingdom without any design of presenting him with the throne of it as certainly we may there is no question but the people who called him are innocent and free from the breach of their oath to their then sovereign since to take up arms is one thing and to petition for assistance to remove priests and evil counselors another  by the first address they made beyond the seas they are perurd in the most intense degrees and without scruple for the time to come may swear to all the kings in christendom and truly did our kings consider all they would never let the clergy swear at all their politic allegiance they would refuse for whores and priests do never want excuse perjury is the violation of an oath taken after a serious and premeditated manner but to break an oath of allegiance to one king without swearing to another makes it impossible that the nonjuring clergy should fall under the censure of so notorious a piece of impiety however the whole fraternity swearers or nonswearers are extraordinarily obliged to their good friend mr author who makes them as ready if they are in the wrong to prove themselves in the right and as good at furnishing themselves with excuses as a thoroughpaced whore before a magistrate or a venerable hypocritical bawd before one of the society for reformation of manners a great token of the respect he has for gods ministers  but if the mutual contract was dissolved the doubts explained the difficulty solved that kings when they descend to tyranny dissolve the bond and leave the subjects free the governments ungirt when justice dies and constitutions are nonentities it is impossible justice should die while the fountain of it is living the channels through which it passes may be choked up for a time but as long as there is wherewithal to feed it at the springhead can never wholly be stopped  the nations all a mob there is no such thing as lords or commons parliament or king a great promiscuous crowd the hydra lies till laws revive and mutual contract ties a chaos free to choose for their own share what case of government they please to wear if to a king they do the reins commit all men are bound in conscience to submit but then that king must by his oath assent to postulatas of the government which if he breaks be cuts off the entail and power retreats to its original the design of this paragraph is to show that the kingly power is the gift of the subjects and that whenever a prince fails in the duty of his office the people may recall their gift and bestow the crown on whom they please this doctrine might do very well in poland amongst the radziouskies and potoskies who are for an elective kingdom but never will suit with a nation whose kingdom has been hereditary upwards of six hundred years and always went to the next heir of course notwithstanding the defects of the king for the time being might occasion his dethronement  this doctrine has the sanction of assent from natures universal parliament the voice of nations and the course of things allow that laws superior are to kings none but delinquents would have justice cease knaves rail at laws as soldiers rail at peace for justice is the end of government as reason is the test of argument if laws are superior to kings the creature may pretend a sovereignty over the creator since they are the product of their royal assent and never capable of being put in force without their approbation the potsherd may as well say to the potter wherefore have thou made me as the law put a question to the king and ask him why have thou done thus  no man was ever yet so void of sense as to debate the right of selfdefence a principle so grafted in the mind with nature born and does like nature bind twisted with reason and with nature too as neither one nor the other can undo selfdefence is acknowledged by universal consent for the voice of nature and enjoined by her laws to be put in practice that is upon any sudden attack of an enemy or any causeless provocation that may be given us to take care of our selves but the divine law which is superior to it and commands us not to lift up our hand against the lords anointed prohibits us to call rebellion selfdefence and even humane ordinance allows kings to be the head of their people and not liable to the censure of those that are inferior to em  nor can this right be less when national reason which governs one should govern all whatever the dialect of courts may tell he that his right demands can never rebel which right if it is by governors denied may be procured by force or foreign aid for tyrannys a nations term for grief as folks cry fire to hasten in relief and when the hated word is heard about all men should come to help the people out that would be pretty indeed and we should have a hopeful nation of it should the same reason or rather want of it which governs him govern all every one would cry such a post of honor was his right and if the king should deny him the grant of it rebellion would be the next word and every fool would cry fire on purpose to make his neighbor as wise as himself  s sergeants when a prisoner they have beset cry out stop thief when all the theft is debt thus england groaned britannias voice was heard and great nassau to rescue her appeared called by the universal voice of fate god and the peoples legal magistrate ye heavens regard almighty jove look down and view thy injured monarch on the throne on their ungrateful heads due vengeance take who sought his aid and then his part forsake witness ye powers it was our call alone which now our pride makes us ashamed to own britannias troubles fetched him from afar to court the dreadful casualties of war but where requital never can be made acknowledgments a tribute seldom paid that is as much as to say after his own way of expressing himself england cried fire and a neighbor came in an instant and quenched it and received the house and all the furniture for his pairs not that i would detract from the debt of gratitude which will be ever due to his majesty but i question not but his majesty holds himself contented with the large acknowledgments of both houses of parliament since  00000 per annum more than the crown revenue is a gift never given to any prince before though this impudent author in defrance of the donors calls down for vengeance on their ungrateful heads  he dwelt in bright marias circling arms defended by the magic of her charms from foreign fears and from domestic harms ambition found no fuel for her fire he had what god could give or man desire till pity zd him from his soft repose his life to unseen hazards to expose till pity moved him in our cause to appear pity that word which now we hate to hear but english gratitude is always such to hate the hand which does oblige too much no body doubts but the late queen of blessed memory was an inestimable present to his majesty but to say he had all that god could give in the possession of her was to set bounds to the power of the deity and say unto the almighty hither could thou go and no farther a thought too big for him that made use of it and too little for that infinite being for whom he made use of it  britannias cries gave birth to his intent and hardly gained his unforeseen assent his boding thoughts foretold him he should find the people fickle selfish and unkind which thought did to his royal heart appear more dreadful than the dangers of the war for nothing grates a generous mind so soon as base returns for hearty service done i dont believe his present majestys assent was so unforeseen as our author would have it neither can it enter into my thoughts that his majestys thoughts foretold to him that we are a fickle selfish and unkind sort of people since his majesty would not have thought it worth his while to accept of the government of a kingdom he foresaw he should be uneasy in or yield to the repeated desires of such petitioners as would be unthankful for the grant of their request  satyr be silent awfully prepare britannias song and williams praise to hear stand by and let her cheerfully rehearse her grateful vows in her immortal verse loud fames eternal trumpet let her sound listen ye distant poles and endless round may the strong blast the welcome news convey as far as sound can reach or spirit fly to neighboring worlds if such there be relate our heros fame for theirs to imitate to distant worlds of spirits let her rehearse for spirits without the helps of voice converse may angels hear the gladsome news on high mixed with their everlasting symphony and hell it self stand in suspense to know whether it be the fatal blast or no that injunctions well enough and the whore his satirical muse has exhausted her magazine of venom so much that it is time her draggletailship should have a holiday for silence but the panygerical lady is the devil and all for her part she cannot quaver a note unless both the poles give their attention and loud fame lends her a trumpet to sound her bombast unmusical notes in as for the subjects part it deserves a better hand to undertake it and as for the undertaker one would think that a worse part might be more fit for him however let us hear what words he puts in britannias mouth though hells acquainted with his way of sounding too well to take it for the last fatal blast  britannia the fame of virtue it is for which i sound and heroes with immortal triumphs crowned fame built on solid virtue swifter flies than morning light can spread my eastern skies the gathering air returns the doubling sound and loud repeating thunders force it round echoes return from caverns of the deep old chaos dreams on it in eternal sleep time hands it forward to its latest vrn from whence it never never shall return nothing is heard so far or lasts so long it is heard by every ear and spoke by every tongue the trumpeters out of tune at the first note that is he has no manner of music in the first line which is discouragement enough to give any farther attention but since the winds and the poles and the endless round wait his motions it will be presumptious in us not to do the same so  now it is a comical sort of a sound indeed  the devilabit of any echo comes from it which is the beauty of music it has taken a flight into old times long ears which though they are hollow enough to return any manner of voice yet the miser is of so greedy a temper as to keep it all to himself  my hero with the sails of honor furled rises like the great genius of the world by pate and fame wisely prepared to be the soul of war and life of victory he spreads the wings of virtue on the throne and every wind of glory fans them on immortal trophies dwell upon his brow fresh as the garlands he has worn but now sweet the sails of honor furled shows a vast reach of thought and an exuberancy of fancy though i know the meaning of it no more than him that wrote it but they are words and that is enough for it is uncivil to expect more when he is made up of nothing else fans them on too is a very elegant expression though he does our great and good king very little service by the wind he raises for him  by different steps the high ascent he gains and differently that high ascent maintains prime for pride and lust of rule make war and struggle for the name of conqueror some fight for fame and some for victory he fights to save and conquers to set free all this is to be confessed and that is a madman who will not own it though i believe his majesty has those heroic virtues in him as to love the name of a conqueror at the same time that he sets us free since none but a conqueror can deserve that glorious appellation  then seek no phrase his titles to conceal and bide with words what actions must reveal no parallel from hebrew stories take of godlike kings my similies to make no borrowed names conceal my living theme but names and things directly i proclaim it is honest merit does his glory raise whom that exalts let no man fear to praise of such a subject no man need be shy virtues above the reach of flattery he needs no character but his own fame nor any flattering titles but his name if phrases conceal his majestys titles it may be taken for granted our poetical man of prose or rather our prosaical man of poetry has published more than is consistent with the true sense of him since to say he will directly proclaim names and thing of him when he takes care to speak very little of either is as much as to say your majestys gracious favors will be an encouragement for me to speak more  williams the name that is spoke by every tongue williams the darling subject of my song listen ye virgins to the charming sound and in eternal dances hand it round your early offerings to this altar bring make him at once a lover and a king may he submit to none but to your arms nor ever be subdued but by your charms may your soft thoughts for him be all sublime and every tender vow be made for him may he be first in every morningthought and heaven never hear a prayer where he is left out may every omen every boding dream be fortunate by mentioning his name may this one charm infernal powers affright and guard you from the terrors of the night may every cheerful glass as it goes down to williams health be cordials to your own let every song be chorust with his name and music pay her tribute to his fame let every poet tune his artful verse and in immortal strains his deeds rehearse and may apollo never more inspire the disobedient bard with his seraphick fire may all my sons their grateful homage pay his praises sing and for his safety pray the reader will infallibly conclude with me that william is a name too good for his hoarse instrument that sounds more like a lancashire hornpipe than a trumpet and that the virgins may listen to eternity and not hear such a thing come from him as a charming sound but i am amazed to see him turn pimp while he is laboring at the painful vocation of a panegyrist and seek out for maidenheads for his majesty after having offered up his wishes that he may be a lover as well as a king how soft thoughts can be sublime without altering the property i confess i am to seek and the next is the uncharitablest wish imaginable viz that heaven should never hear a prayer where his name is left out since we ought to pray for our enemies and some disaffected people who dont own his present majesty for their king without doubt pray for another but this is the most diverting passage of all after he has blamed the men for taking a cup so freely he encourages the ladies to take a cheerful glass and drink about as a sort of a cordial for them  satyr return to our unthankful isle secured by heavens regard and williams toil to both ungrateful and to both untrue rebels to god and to good nature too saytyr may return if it pleases but no body will take notice of its scandalous appearance how we have been either ungrateful or untrue to our king and country may be seen by the large sums we have advanced for the service of both  if ever this nation he distressed again to whomsoeer they cry they will cry in vain to heaven they cannot have the face to look or if they should it would but heaven provoke to hope for help from man would be too much mankind would always tell em of the dutch how they came here our freedoms to maintain were paid and cursed and hurried home again how by their aid we first dissolved our fears and then our helpers damned for foreigners it is not our english temper to do better for englishmen think every man their debtor that is more than he knows six hundred thousand pounds is a great deal of money and there are people in the world would jump at it once more should we have occasion for their assistance and the best instance that can be thought on to prevail with any of our neighbors will be that we paid the dutch before we sent them home again as for abuses upon us for damning them for foreigners twas done by vote of parliament and had the kings own royal assent to it and if he has any thing to remonstrate it against the sixth of february is near at hand when he may see what thanks our senators will give him for finding fault with their wise consulation  it is worth observing that we never complained of foreigners nor of the wealth they gained till all their services were at an end wise men affirm it is the english way never to grumble till they come to pay and then they always think their tempers such the work too little and the pay too much that observation is a very wrong one to my knowledge for the dutch were found fault with some years before the peace though we stood in need of troops for our quota toward the war and twas more advisable to pay foreigners which were veterane troops than raise new ones of raw and unexperienced natives  as frighted patients when they want a cure bid any price and any pain endure but when the doctors remedies appear the cures too easy and the price too dear we never thought that we paid the dutch too much though they were of such an unsatisfied temper as to think it too little so that his simile is very little to the purpose that relates to the doctor and his patients  great portland never was banterd when he strove for us his masters kindest thoughts to move we never lampoomd his conduct when employed king jamess secret councils to divide then we caressed him as the only man which could the doubtful oracle explain the only hushia able to repel the dark designs of our achitophel compared his masters courage to his sense the ablest statesman and the bravest prince on his wise conduct we depended much and liked him never the worse for being dutch nor was he valued more than he deserved freely he ventured faithfully he served in all king williams dangers he has shared in englands quarrels always he appeared the revolution first and then the boyne in both his counsels and his conduct shine his martial valor flanders will confess and france regrets his managing the peace faithful to englands interest and her king the greatest reason of our murmuring ten years in english service he appeared and gained his masters and the worlds regard but it is not england s custom to reward the wars are over england needs him not now he is a dutchman and the lord knows what great portland at the time of the revolution was plain mine here bentnick and possessed no place which englishmen were wont to be masters of so that he gave no occasion of murmuring to a people who stand mightily upon their birthright and no body questions but he performed his embassy in france with an extraordinary conduct but we never caressed him as the only man sit for so great an employment being well satisfied that his lordship notwithstanding his great abilities has those who are natives of this kingdom that can equal him but i shall never be of the opinion that france regrets his managing the peace till what passed between his lordship and the duke de boufflers be made public which perhaps may lead me into a lower esteem of the french politics and england  though it is not her custom to reward has recompensed that noble peers services by giving his royal master such an addition to the crownrevenue as to enable him to make his lordship what returns his majesty shall think fitting  schonbergh the ablest soldier of his age with great nassau did in our cause engage both joined for englands rescue and defense the greatest captain and the greatest prince with what applause his stories did we tell stories which europes volumes largely swell we counted him an army in our aid where he commanded no man was afraid his actions with a constant conquest shine from villavitiosa to the rhine france flanders germany his fame confess and all the world was fond of him but us our turn first served we grudged him the command witness the grateful temper of the land if he means the old marshall de schonberg as certainly he must by what he relates of him he is very much in the dark as to his knowledge for that general was never ill spoken of by the people of england but deservedly counted next his majesty their support in time of war or if he would have us understand him as to the present duke his son and generalissimo of the forces in england whose post has chiefly been since the reduction of ireland here in england and who has been so far from extending his conquests from villavitioso to the rhine though without question he has courage and conduct to do it enough if opportunity should offer though i never heard his grace had orders to attempt any thing but the taking furnes and dixmude some malicious people perhaps have spoken disrespectfully of him but it is so far from being a natural affront put upon him that it is nothing else but the resentments of some soldiers under his command  we blame the k  that he relies too much on strangers germans hugonots and dutch and seldom does his great affairs of state to english counselors communicate the fact might very well be answered thus he has so often been betrayed by us he must have been a madman to rely on english g  ns fidelity for laying other arguments aside this thought might mortify our english pride that foreigners have faithfully obeyed him and none but englishmen have ever betray him they have our ships and merchants bought and sold and bartered english blood for foreign gold first to the french they sold our turkyfleet and injured talmash next at camaret the king himself is sheltered from their snares not by his merit but the crown he wears experience tell us it is the english way their benefactors always to betray without doubt his majesty would find himself more assured of the hearts and purses of his english subjects if it could be possible if none but they were admitted into his majestys council in relation to english affairs for certainly a reliance on their fidelity who have run all hazards ventured their lives and fortunes and every thing that was dear to them for his service would not be improper at a juncture of time when the hearts and purses of those subjects may be very necessary i know of no englishman in a place of trust that has betrayed him ut in his majestys younger days in holland there were de wits who would had not providence hindred their designs and as for the loss of the turkeyfleet and the brave general talmash few men of understanding but know both those unhappy miscarriages lie at a countrys door who have no great aversion to herrings and butter  and lest examples should be too remote a modern magistrate of famous note shall give you his own history by rote i will make it out deny it he that can his worship is a trueborn englishman in all the latitude that empty word by modern acceptations understood the parishbooks his great descent record and now he hopes ere long to be a lord and truly as things go it would be pity but such as he bore office in the city while robbry for burntoffering he brings and gives to god what he has stole from kings great monuments of charity he raises and good st magnus whistles out his praises to citygaols he grants a jubilee and hires huzzas from his own mobile lately he wore the golden chain and gown with which equipt he thus harangud the town if our author was capable of blushing he might exert that faculty now when he is going to abuse a gentleman whose name is as ancient as that of most families and who has advanced his reputation and his wealth to such a degree that never londonmagistrate acquired such deserved esteem during the execution of his office and never one went out of it with more good wishes and money after he had bestowed so much in charitable uses but as these calumnies were written on purpose to lessen the number of those who had espoused his party against the ensuing election for members of parliament for the city and the author of it was in fee with that scandalous hypocritical sect that gave bills out against him so sir charles duncomb has the less to be concerned at from the known partiality and inveteracy of those that are his enemies and may stand secured of those rewards for his good works which no hirelingscribler can detract from and which shall deduce his name to posterity when such a fellow as the author represents himself to be shall not be known so much as to have been born  sir c   s d   bs fine speech etc with clouted iron shoes and sheepskin breeches more rags than manners and more dirt than riches from driving cows and calves to laytonmarket while of my greatness there appeared no spark yet behold i come to let you see the pride with which exalted beggars always ride it is well known to all people who have any knowledge of the gentleman he insolently spits his venom at that his father had not wherewithal to educate him as his sprightly genius deserved yet he was so far from making him a cowdriver which sort of people are seldom thought to write and read that he had all the education necessary for one who being born to no great matters of possession was one day to launch out into the world to make his fortune  born to the needful labors of the plough the cartwhip gracet me as the chain does now nature and fate in doubt what course to take whether i should a lord or ploughboy make kindly at last resolved they would promote me and first a knave and then a knight they vote me what fate appointed nature did prepare and furnishd me with an exceeding care to fit me for what they designed to have me and every gift but honesty they gave me liars they say ought to have good memories and the poet should have bethought himself of his making sir charles a cowdriver in the preceding paragraph before he made him a carter in this else he must never expect the character of a man of exceeding care which he has given a person that deserves it without an irony  and thus equipt to this proud town i came in quest of bread and not in quest of fame blind to my future fate an humble boy free from the guilt and glory i enjoy the hopes which my ambition entertained were in the name of footboy all contained the greatest heights from small beginnings rise the gods were great on earth before they reached the skies if he had not been equipped otherwise than our author would have him and been furnished with honesty which all persons who have had any dealing him are ready to testify yet even then he had exceeded him that makes his speech for him and all his fancied acquirements and if to come up to town in order to advance his fortunes may fall under the diminutive way of business that men follow who are in quest of bread then every clergyman physician and person of other creditable callings may fall under the same imputation  b  well the generous temper of whose mind was always to be bountiful inclined whether by his ill fate or fancy led first took me up and furnished me with bread the little services he put me to seemed labors rather than were truly so but always my advancement be designed for it was his very nature to be kind large was his soul his temper ever free the best of masters and of men to me and i who was before decreed by fate to be made infamous as well as great with an obsequious diligence obeyed him till trusted with his all and then betrayed him sir charles d  mb has often made appear that he was never ungrateful for the kindnesses he received of alderman backwell and is ready to own him now in the midst of his prosperity for the first and some occasion of his rising in the world and if the alderman was his master as possibly he might though not in the low station the poetaster fixes him in it is a sign he was an excellent and faithful servant or a man of that famous bankers penetrancy of judgment and cautious way of proceeding would never have trusted him with his all  all his past kindesses i trampled on ruined his fortunes to erect my own so vipers in the bosom bred begin to hiss at that hand first which took them in with eager treachry i his fall pursued and my first trophies were ingratitude if he had ruined his fortunes the son of that honest and unhappy bankrupt would have shown his resentments for it but mr b    ll who is now living is satisfied of other things and none at this time has a greater respect for sir charles d  mb and visits him oftener in the country upon all occasions  ingratitudes the worst of human guilt the basest action mankind can commit which like the sin against the holy ghost has least of honor and of guilt the most distinguished from all other crimes but this that it is a crime which no man would confess that sin alone which should not be forgiven on earth although perhaps it may in heaven we have nothing to urge in defense of the sin of ingratitude or to speak in behalf of any person who is guilty of it but when it is applied to a gentleman who has it not in his temper to reward good with evil we should be guilty of the sin our selves should we not stand up in his vindication the sin against the holy ghost is unpardonable and is the highest offense any human being can commit but he makes a comparison between it and ingratitude which is venial with god and man which shows he does not rightly understand the nature of the crime he writes about  thus my first benefactor i orethrew and how should i be to a second true the public trust came next into my care and i to use them scurvily prepare my needy sovereign lord i played upon and lent him many a thousand of his own for which great interest i took care to charge and so my illgot wealth became so large that is as much as to say he broke the aldermans back by not holding it when it is apparently true king charles the  ds shutting up the exchequer was the cause of it and he had never been forced out of his native country by his creditors had not his faithful services been overbalancd by the treachery of some persons who managed his then sovereigns treasury i believe the author is no great conjurer of a grammarian by making the word them which is of the plural number agree with public trust which is certainly the singular but to take notice of his faults and incoherences that way would employ us too much and it is so well known that when sir charles farmed one of the crown revenues no person that ever managed a place of trust behaved himself more to the satisfaction of his king and country than himself  my predecessor judas was a fool fitter to have been whipped and sent to school than sell a savior had i been at hand his master had not been so cheap trepanned i would have made the eager jews have found for thirty pieces thirty thousand pound this is a high rant indeed the poet might have as well compared himself to one of the most faithful among the apostles as the gentleman whose good name he takes such liberty with to the most faithless  my cousin ziba of immortal fame ziba and i shall never want a name firstborn of treason nobly did advance his masters fall for his inheritance by whose keen arts old david first began to break his sacred oath to jonathan the good old king it is thought was very loath to break his word and therefore broke his oath zibas a traitor of some quality yet ziba might have been informed by me had i been there he never had been content with half the estate nor half the government the person whom he rails at under the name of ziba has so signalized himself in his services to the english government that his envious reflections on him return upon himself and without doubt if the king was loath to break his word he would have had some scruple at breaking his oath since perjury is a crime infinitely greater than the breach of a promise  in our late revolution twas thought strange that i of all mankind should like the change but they who wonderd at it never knew that in it i did my old game pursue nor had they heard of twenty thousand pound which never was lost yet never could be found the report this paragraph is grounded upon is as false as hell and sir charles was so far from getting such a large sum by the revolution that it is well known to some persons who are more acquainted with him than the author he lost considerably by several belonging to the court of st germains yet he valued the interest of the country he was born in more than his own and rejoiced at his present majestys accession to the throne purely out of a principle of love to the kingdom not because he had outwitted the king  thus all things in their turn to sale i bring god and my master first and then the king till by successful villainies made bold i thought to turn the nation into gold and so to forg  y my hand i bent not doubting i could gull the government but there was ruffld by the parliament and if i scapd the unhappy tree to climb twas want of law and not for want of crime the very vote of the house of commons which has been printed by his enemies to hinder his election in the city speaks otherwise and though there were not a few who gaped more after his large possessions than the good of their fellow subjects the wisdom of the parliament thought fit to drop the pursuit of the matter notwithstanding an enemy of his who was against reassumptions and is now above being a member of the house pushed on the matter in dispute as far as possible and if such a crime as forgery could have been proved against him there was law enough at that time in force against him and they would scarce have put themselves to the trouble of voting for a new act of parliament for him  but my the devil old friend who printed in my face a needful competence of english brass having more business yet for me to do and loath to lose his trusty servant so managed the matter with such art and skill as saved his hero and threw out the b  l if the devil stood sir charless friend and hindered the bill from passing the parliament of consequence must have been influenced by him which is a very disrespectful reflection on so venerable an assembly  and now i am graced with unexpected honors for which i will certainly abuse the donors knighted and made a tribune of the people whose laws and properties i am like to keep well the custos rotulorum of the city and captain of the guards of their banditti surrounded by my catchpoles i declare against the needy debtor open war i hang poor thieves for stealing of your pelf and suffer none to rob you but my self sir charles no more made an interest to be dubbed a knight than he did to be made a sheriff but since it was his majestys and the cities pleasure that he should have those unexpected honors conferred on him he was ready to do what lay in his power for the service of both though he was so far from declaring war against needy debtors that he made even their enemies to be at peace with em and reconciled their creditors to em by assisting those that were insolvent  the king commanded me to help reform ye and how i will do it miss    shall inform ye i keep the best seraglio in the nation and hope in time to bring it into fashion no brimstonewhore need fear the lash from me that part i will leave to brother jeffery our gallants need not go abroad to rome i will keep a whoring jubilee at home whorings the darling of my inclination ant i a magistrate for reformation for this my praise is sung by every bard for which bridewell would be a just reward in print my panegyricks fill the street and hired goalbirds their huzzas repeat some charities contrived to make a show have taught the needy rabble to do so whose empty noise is a mechanic fame since for sir beelzebub they would do the same our author who has it not in his nature to be tender of any ones reputation would have given us the name of the lady as he has done that of the knight were there any thing of truth in what he affirms but he knows so little of the matter that he cannot so much as give us the first letter of her name an infallible argument of his insufficiency in matters of proof if bridewell be the reward of those that cry up the great actions of worthy persons newgate certainly should be the place of residence for those that publish their praises on the unworthy and though i scarce believe any of the first will be sent to beat hemp yet if common discourse be not false one of the last is likely to be sent to the chequer inn in newgate street if captain darby in st martinslane be taken up by a messenger as it is reported  the conclusion then let us boast of ancestors no more or deeds of heroes done in days of yore in latent records of the ages past behind the rear of time in long oblivion placed for if our virtues must in lines descend the merit with the families would end and intermixtures would most fatal grow for vice would be hereditary too the tainted blood would of necessity involuntary wickedness convey the conclusion bears very little proportion to the premises for the close of the poem is filled with a libel against sir charles duncomb only who is so far from boasting of his ancestors that he is very ready to acknowledge he did not come into the world with that advantage as some do if he did actually value himself on the account of his descent what relation does that bear to the nation in general or what plea has the author to justify himself with for taxing above two millions of people with a folly which he only charged one in particular with  vice like ill nature for an age or two may seem a generation to pursue but virtue seldom does regard the breed fools do the wise and wise men fools succeed ill nature is certainly a vice therefore the consequence of his simile is that vice is like vice which every one knew before and if virtue does not regard the breed i am inclinable to think he deserves no manner of excuse for making vice an attendant of it and tainting the whole english posterity with the baseness of their forefathers since a love of virtue without doubt has as much prevalence and runs in the blood as an inclination toward actions that are vicious   what is it to us what ancestors we had if good what better or what worse if bad examples are for imitation set yet all men follow virtue with regret that question is resolved without any difficulty for if our ancestors were good than the remembrance of their brave actions would excite us to tread in the same paths of honor if bad the reflections on their dishonorable practices would create in us a detestation of vice and make us endeavor to degenerate from em  could but our ancestors retrieve their fate and see their offspring thus degenerate how we contend for birth and names unknown and build on their past actions not our own they would cancel records and their tombs deface and openly disown the vile degenerate race for fame of families is all a cheat it is personal virtue only makes us great this paragraph seems to contradict the main design of all that went before for the intent of the satyr was to render our ancestors infamous but now he says we degenerate from em which in plain english is we do nothing that is not praise worthy a i am glad to hear from him that personal virtue ly makes us great since he is likely to go without any great stock of fame who has so little virtue to truck for it by way of exchange for if he has as small a share of honesty as he has shown of good nature through his whole lamentable piece of poetry he may more properly be styled a bankrupt than a dealer in that sort of commodity  finis
