store with these makes a fire in the midst of which fire being seated his wings are the bellows which kindle it up till it is properly heated and farther they tell us when no longer in flame this combustible flashes a spick and span new one jumps out of the ashes another wise tale to a dragon gave birth whose teeth it is said were but sown in the earth when it is gravely attested and let who will smile that a regiment of soldiers appeared rank and file these stories it is granted are very absurd no man ever saw such a dragon or bird yet folly and love to be met with asunder i hold a phenomenon of such a kind a rarity so much more worthy to brag on that sooner than set out this wonder to find i would be bound to produce you both phoenix and dragon  recitative jupiter in short there is no such thing as bearing on it her vixen tongue gains strength by wearing on it like camomile or old anteus why we are the jest of all who see us the jibe of every wag sarcastic but to the court ecclesiastic i will cite her for good reasons various and there get license to unmarry us  mars what you it is all a flam how often at a sham tear we have seen you soften and while her shower

taunts sneers hard words and curtain lecturings  iris why for the past it is past never think on it youre now near ruin  juno on the brink on it  iris let us then try ere yet it catch ye from this same precipice to snatch ye  juno but how dear iris how  iris have patience as generals be what will their stations think it both politic and wise deserters to employ and spies so you by way of go between us shall in this case employ dame venus for if she lend you but her zone the charms of love are all your own  air with that begirt each dowdy girl gets every charm does she but ask it her teeth become a row of pearl enclosed within a coral casket carnations bloom upon her cheeks roses take place of blotch and pimple the airs perfumed whenever she speaks and cupids play in every dimple recitative juno dont name the wretch  iris set a good face of the matter maam yours is no case one cures by any thing one pleases physic for desperate dseases must desperate be maam  juno i will assure you miss boldface  what do you mean  iris to cure you better than nostrums can or simples where is this same queen of smiles and dimples  air venus who calls on her whose powerful art erects a throne in every heart whose love all court whose anger fear  venus yclept  behold her here sighs some fond youth his love unkind would he some watchful argus blind glows some fair virgins modest cheek with wishes that she dare not speak  recitative venus how can the humble queen of love the powerful wife of thundering jove in ought oblige  speak mighty juno  juno i am told good woman as how you know to gain mens hearts that you can win em and as you list to the grindstone pin em now you must know all in a whiff my spoute and i have had a tiff and now the villain talks of parting  oh it will break my heart for certain  venus patience dear maam   juno twill all come home to hi i know not what the devils come to him with his fine fiats and his ordeals  but the other day he broke my cordials and sorely did my patience handle because i talked a little scandal air juno ine sport indeed for god and godlin to see great jove become moll codlin and threat his wife with fist and horsewhip because she loves a little gossip yet he forsooth can trot and amble and after scores of misses ramble leave gods at hercules your grinning the master of the worlds a spinning though while such worthy work is doing slap goes the universe to ruin the trumpet sounds wars wide and civil convulse the earth while to the devil they go their own way  and no wonder his lightnings out  asleep his thunder  recitative venus well madam would you be as blessed as i am in love but wear this cestus which with observance of your duty will turn deformity to beauty  juno a pinch of snuff or dram did give me thou could not half so well revive me my dungeons changed into a palace thou have reprieved me at the gallows thy words are cabbage to starved tailors or calms to poor exhausted sailors while winds and billows are in rumptions or gold to pockets in consumptions now let him dare take any word ill come help me on with this same girdle  venus yet take me  they have but pretext to it who mark not well the charm annexed to it your husbands now on some vagary  when he comes home pray be you wary whatever riot he may kick up however stagger swear or hiccup you do not speak one single syllable if you should find these terms fulfilable youre sure that instant to reclaim him heaven shall a rake no longer name him but setting taunts and wordy war by juno and jove prove joan and darby  juno you are right  more happy than a king am i i thank you kindly mrs thingamy air juno hear the merry minstrel sound on the ear it rings while all the strings are one entire vibration the tinkling pleasure spreads around and as it plays sweetly conveys from sense to sense soft eloquence in thrilling circulation but stringless broken out of tune times thrown away for did you play without the least cessation and strum from january till june you still may bang at every twang the dismal hum the more you thrum speaks but its mutilation just so let down its pegs the heart in sadness sits nor once admits of any consolation but screw it into tune each smart and anxious care dissolves to air alone its joys the mind employs and all is jubilation  recitative lord lord i never saw her feller one minute in the garret next in the cellar to blow both hot and cold she is able just like the satyr in the fable  venus no wonder  jealousys a viris numbs and corrodes the passions iris but i will be off and at a distance watch lest they need from me assistance should my scheme take should noise and riot yield here in heaven to peace and quiet scolding once shut out from our portals who knows that plague may cease amongst mortals air our jupiter has near his throne two vessels which he fills the one with benefits alone the other crams with ills from the good vessel health content plenty and bliss he gives while from the evil forth are sent gout stone and scolding wives ii thus to mankind with heedful care in just proportion weighed the lot to each each best can bear by joves decrees conveyed unless his patience when to rub juno the devil drives then headlong from the left hand tub go troops of scolding wives iii often this complaint on me like air from men still passed away till that same madam juno there let loose her tongue today but now entreating jove i will go to chequer not their lives with any other spot of woe who are plagued with scolding wives recitative iris if to have pomp and greatness this it is rather than live the life of my mistress rather than thus for ever jingle by jingo i would for one live single nor be in splendid misery kept here for coif and crook change crown and scepter the spheres that the ear so sweetly splits for thrushes blackbirds and tomtits air how happy she who never can know the misery of the great who far from reach of sceptered woe finds in her low estate joy in her innocence  delight in scenes that still present pleasures that health and strength excite and transport in content ii one brook her mirror and her drink the happy wanderer seeks and as her lambs play round its brink good nature paints her cheeks few are her wants certain her joy for reasons glad consent points out her innocent employ and guides her to content recitative jupiter yes yes it is the only way to nick her and yet though fortified with liquor though halfseas over i will not dissemble the very thoughts on it makes me tremble but come be firm my heart for meet it is ere phoebus rise from lap of thetis when on nights glims i have put the extinguisher this wife of mine that i reliquish her oh what delight in joy to roll me without a creature to control me when from my wife i shall be parted and yet  no pangs no fears fainthearted compunction doubts fly far away and let jove sing tit fall de ray air jupiter i have seen a bear who long did puzzle to loose froms mouth an ugly muzzle i have seen a linnet vent its rage in vainly fluttering against its cage i have seen snared lions  ay a score while forests trembled at their roar i was the bear the lion the linnet i was caught in a snare and while i was in it oh how did i roar and flutter and puzzle to get rid of the cage the net and the muzzle and yet knew not how but now my wings are at liberty so are my jaws uncumberd by net i can put out my paws and my unfettered limbs all so nimble advance that i think i could join in a country dance no longer i roar or flutter or puzzle i have thrown off the snare the cage and the muzzle and am now  oh ye powers what rapture propose the bear the lion the linnet  let loose  jupiter but hold i hear no creature stir who waits within there  iris   iris sir  jupiter what wonders this i hear no riot the storm is hushed my house is quiet one may perceive the foftest head why sure your lady is not dead  iris dead heaven forbid  no you will not bury 0her this bout she is alive and merry  jupiter and silent  then will i be halterd  iris why sir you see the case is altered  jupiter nay nay explain these has and hums  iris let her explain them here she comes  jupiter she is sulky now  ah sulk  twont hurt you psha youre a fool  how is this a courtsey the tricks too stale to pass it is vile this calm forbodes a storm  a smile well this is strange she is lost her tongue which else ere this a peal had rung it is so in faith  what sweet surprise juno how do  she is charming eyes cupids inhabit there a score i never noticd this before if we go on thus on my life i shall grow fond of my own wife  venus so  it works rarely  jupiter how is this venus she knows not sure what passed between us come you our pleasures to destroy maam  venus not i indeed sir  give you joy maam it is done and you may silence break juno shakes her head oh there is no fear of that  come speak  jupiter she cannot  venus o yes she can  jupiter come come youre jesting  venus no  jupiter what ant she dumb  juno yes dumb and blind deaf and insensible held by an influence indispensible to loath and scorn beyond all measure those joys that do not give you pleasure  air meek i will be as venus dove your presence court your absence mourn love shall be the price of love and kindness ask a kind return folly shall never my mind defile from prudence will i never depart my face shall wear a constant smile and duty govern in my heart recitative venus thus have we proved it never happens that ornament and outward trappings can make on the heart the least impression much less secure a fixed possession our jove here has been long time married yet his wifes fondness had miscarried each thing in life she did was wrong until she kindly  held her tongue learn hence that husbands will be blind to every beauty but the mind great venus there should hold her court there should the loves and graces sport there rapture beamed in every feature bound by that cestus called good nature  air come away then and take an example here above below and all who have seen us for plain to your senses it soon shall appear that rich and poor who true bliss would ensure lest they meet with miscarriage must remember in marriage good natures the cestus of venus juno resigned to my duty at last resolved to repent what is past every folly and fault to give over i now open my eyes and my only surprise is i never yet thought on it before  venus it is a noble resolve may the stars in their spheres for millions of years still find you each time they revolve to your husbands faults blinder he kinder and kinder till juno and jove are envied below and above  end of the cestus
