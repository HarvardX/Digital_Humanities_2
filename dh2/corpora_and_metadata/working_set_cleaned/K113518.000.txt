william dampier  london printed for james knapton at the crown in st pauls churchyard   0   to the right honorable thomas earl of pembroke lord president of her majestys most honorable privy council etc my lord the honor i had of being employed in the service of his late majesty f illustrious memory at the me when your lordship presied at the admiralty gives me the boldness to ask your protection of the following papers they consist of some remarks made upon very distant climates which i should have the vanity to think altogether new could i persuade my self they had escaped your lordships knowledge however i have been so cautious of publishing any thing in my whole book that is generally known that i have denied my self the pleasure of paying the due honors to your lordships name in the dedication i am ashamed my lord to offer you so imperfect a present having not time to set down all the memoirs of my last voyage but as the particular service i have now undertaken hinders me from finishing this volume so i hope it will give me an opportunity of paying my respects to your lordship in a new one  the world is apt to judge of every thing by the success and whoever has ill fortune will hardly be allowed a good name this my lord was my unhappiness in my late expedition in the roebuck which foundered through perfect age near the island of ascension i suffered extremely in my reputation by that misfortune though i comfort my self with the thoughts that my enemies could not charge any neglect upon me and since i have the honor to be acquitted by your lordships judgment i should be very humble not to value my self upon so complete a vindication this and a world of other favors which i have been so happy as to receive from your lordships goodness do engage me to be with an everlasting respect  my lord your lordships most faithful and obedient servant will dampier  the preface the favorable reception my two former volumes of voyages and descriptions have already met with in the world gives me reason to hope that notwithstanding the objections which have been raised against me by prejudiced persons this third volume likewise may in some measure be acceptable to candid and impartial readers who are curious to know the nature of the inhabitants animals plants soil etc in those distant countries which have either seldom or not at all been visited by any europeans  it has almost always been the fate of those who have made new discoveries to be disesteemed and slightly spoken of by such as either have had no true relish and value for the things themselves that are discovered or have had some prejudice against the persons by whom the discoveries were made it would be vain therefore and unreasonable in me to expect to escape the censure of all or to hope for better treatment than far worthier persons have met with before me but this satisfaction i am sure of having that the things themselves in the discovery of which i have been employed are most worthy of our diligentest search and inquiry being the various and wonderful works of god in different parts of the world and however unfit a person i may be in other respects to have undertaken this task yet at least i have given a faithful account and have found some things undiscovered by any before and which may at least be some assisttance and direction to better qualified persons who shall come after me  it has been objected against me by some that my accounts and descriptions of things are dry and jejune not filled with variety of pleasant matter to divert and gratify the curious reader how far this is true i must leave to the world to judge but if i have been exactly and strictly careful to give only true relations and descriptions of things as i am sure i have and if my descriptions be such as may be of use not only to my self which i have already in good measure experienced but also to others in future voyages and likewise to such readers at home as are more desirous of a plain and just account of the true nature and state of the things described than of a polite and rhetorical narrative i hope all the defects in my style will meet with an easy and ready pardon  others have taxed me with borrowing from other mens journals and with insufficiency as if i was not my self the author of what i write but published things digested and drawn up by others as to the first part of this objection i assure the reader i have taken nothing from any man without mentioning his name except some very few relations and particular observations received from credible persons who desired not to be named and these i have always expressly distinguished in my books from what i relate as of my own observing and as to the latter i think it so far from being a diminution to one of my education and employment to have what i write revised and corrected by friends that on the contrary the best and most eminent authors are not ashamed to own the same thing and look upon it as an advantage  lastly i know there are some who are apt to slight my accounts and descriptions of things as if it was an easy matter and of little or no difficulty to do all that i have done to visit little more than the coasts of unknown countries and make short and imperfect observations of things only near the shore but whoever is experienced in these matters or considers things impartially will be of a very different opinion and any one who is sensible how backward and refractory the seamen are apt to be in long voyages when they know not whither they are going how ignorant they are of the nature of the winds and the shifting seasons of the monsoons and how little even the officers themselves generally are skilled in the variation of the needle and the use of the azimuth compass besides the hazard of all outward accidents in strange and unknown seas any one i say who is sensible of these difficulties will be much more pleased at the discoveries and observations i have been able to make than displeased with me that i did not make more  thus much i thought necessary to premise in my own vindication against the objections that have been made to my former performances but not to trouble the reader any further with matters of this nature what i have more to offer shall be only in relation to the following voyage  for the better apprehending the course of this voyage and the situation of the places mentioned in it i have here as in the former volumes caused a map to be engraven with a pricked line representing to the eye the whole thread of the voyage at one view besides draughts and figures of particular places to make the descriptions i have given of them more intelligible and useful  moreover which i had not the opportunity of doing in my former voyages having now had in the ship with me a person skilled in drawing i have by this means been enabled for the greater satisfaction of the curious reader to present him with exact cuts and figures of several of the principal and most remarkable of those birds beasts fishes and plants which are described in the following narrative and also of several which not being able to give any better or so good an account of as by causing them to be exactly engraven the reader will not find any further description of them but only that they were found in such or such particular countries the plants themselves are in the hands of the ingenious dr woodward i could have caused many others to be drawn in like manner but that i resolved to confine my self to such only as had some very remarkable difference in the shape of their principal parts from any that are found in europe i have besides several birds and fishes ready drawn which i could not put into the present volume because they were found in countries to the description whereof the following narrative does not reach for being obliged to prepare for another voyage sooner than i at first expected i have not been able to continue the ensuing narrative any further than to my departure from the coast of new holland but if it please god that i return again safe the reader may expect a continuation of this voyage from my departure from new holland till the foundring of my ship near the island of ascension  in the mean time to make the narrative in some measure complete i shall here add a summary abstract of that latter part of the voyage whereof i have not had time to draw out of my journals a full and particular account at large departing therefore from the coast of new holland in the beginning of september      for the reasons mentioned page     we arrived at tymor sept    and anchored off that island on the   th we obtained a small supply of fresh water from the governor of a dutch fort and factory there we found also there a portuguese settlement and were kindly treated by them on the  d of december we arrived on the coast of new guinea where we found good fresh water and had commerce with the inhabitants of a certain island called pulosabuti after which passing to the northward we ranged along the coast to the eastermost part of new guinea which i found does not join to the main land of newguinea but is an island as i have described it in my map and called it new britain  it is probable this island may afford many rich commodities and the natives may be easily brought to commerce but the many difficulties i at this time met with the want of convenience to clean my ship the fewness of my men their desire to hasten home and the danger of continuing in these circumstances in seas where the shoals and coasts were utterly unknown and must be searched out with much caution and length of time hindered me from prosecuting any further at present my intended search what i have been able to do in this matter for the public service will i hope be heartily received and no difficulties shall discourage me from endeavoring to promote the same end whenever i have an opportunity put into my hands  may    in our return we arrived again at tymor june    we past by part of the island java july   we anchored in bataviaroad and i went ashore visited the dutch general and desired the privilege of buying provisions that i wanted which was granted me in this road we lay till the   th of october following when having fitted the ship recruited my self with provisions filled all my water and the season of the year for returning toward europe being come i set sail from batavia and on the   th of december made the cape of good hope whence departing jan    we made the island of santa hellena on the   st and february the   st the island of aseension near to which my ship having sprung a leak which could not be stopped foundred at sea with much difficulty we got ashore where we lived on goats and turtle and on the   th of february found to our great comfort on the s e side of a high mountain about half a mile from its top a spring of fresh water i returned to england in the canterbury eastindiaship for which wonderful deliverance from so many and great dangers i think my self bound to return continual thanks to almighty god whose divine providence if it shall please to bring me

this voyage and  0 men and boys with  0 months provision we had several of the kings ships in company bound for spithead and plymouth and by noon we were off dungeness we parted from them that night and stood down the channel but found our selves next morning nearer the french coast than we expected c de hague bearing s e and by e   l there were many other ships some nearer some further off the french coast who all seemed to have gone nearer to it than they thought they should my master who was somewhat troubled at it at first was not displeased however to find that he had company in his mistake which as i have heard is a very common one and fatal to many ships the occasion of it is the not allowing for the change of the variation since the making of the charts which captain halley has observed to be very considerable i shall refer the reader to his own account of it which he caused to be published in a single sheet of paper purposely for a caution to such as pass to and fro the english channel the title of it is in the margin an advertisement necessary to be observed in the navigation up and down the channel of england sold by s smith at the princes arms in st pauls churchyard price   d and my own experience thus confirming to me the usefulness of such a caution i was willing to take this occasion of helping toward the making it the more public  not to trouble the reader with every days run nor with the winds or weather but only in the remoter parts where it may be more particularly useful standing away from c la hague we made the start about   that afternoon which being the last land we saw of england we reckoned our departure from thence though we had rather have taken it from the lizard if the hazy weather would have suffered us to have seen it  the first land we saw after we were out of the channel was c finisterre which we made on the   th and on the   th made lancerota one of the canary islands of which and of allegrance another of them i have here given the sights as they both appeared to us at two several bearings and distances table i no      we were now standing away for the island teneriffe where i intended to take in some wine and brandy for my voyage on sunday half an hour past   in the afternoon we made the island and crowded in with all our sails till   when the n e point of the isle bore w s w did   leagues but being then so far off that i could not expect to get in before night i lay by till next morning deliberating whether i should put in at santa cruz or at oratavia the one on the e the other on the w side of the island which lies mostly north and south and these are the principal ports on each side i chose santa cruz as the better harbor especially at this time of the year and as best furnished with that sort of wine which i had occasion to take in for my voyage so there i come to an anchor jan  0th in    fathomwater black slimy ground about half a mile from the shore from which distance i took the sight of the town table i no    in this road ships must ride in  0  0 or  0 fathomwater not above half a mile from the shore at sarthest and if there are many ships they must ride close one by another the shore is generally high land and in most places steep to this road lies so open depictions of the canary islands table i canary islands no   i allegrance did about    leagues at these bearings i lancerota shows thus at ye same time did about    l at these bear no   i allegrance did about    leagues at the bearings i lancerota shows thus at ye same time did about    l the sight of lancerota continued no   i teneriffe  to the east that winds from that side make a great swell and very bad going ashore in boats the ships that ride here are then often forced to put to sea and sometimes to cut or slip their anchors not being able to weigh them the best and smoothest landing is in a small sandy cove about a mile to the n e of the road where there is good water with which ships that lade here are supplied and many times ships that lade at oratavia which is the chief port for trade send their boats hither for water that is a worse port for westerly than this is for easterly winds and then all ships that are there put to sea between this wateringplace and santa cruz are two little forts which with some batteries scattered along the coast command the road santa cruz its self is a small unwalled town fronting the sea guarded with two other forts to secure the road there are about  00 houses in the town all   stories high strongly built with stone and covered with pantile it has two convents and one church which are the best buildings in the town the forts here could not secure the spanish galleons from admiral blake though they halld in close under the main fort many of the inhabitants that are now living remember that action in which the english battered the town and did it much damage and the marks of the shot still remain in the fortwalls the wrecks of the galleons that were burnt here lie in    fathomwater and it is said that most of the plate lies there though some of it was hastily carried ashore at blakes coming in sight  soon after i had anchored i went ashore here to the governor of the town who received me very kindly and invited me to dine with him the next day i returned on board in the evening and went ashore again with two of my officers the next morning hoping to get up the hill time enough to see laguna the principal town and to be back again to dine with the governor of santa cruz for i was told that laguna was but   mile off the road is all the way up a pretty steep hill yet not so steep but that carts go up and down laden there are public houses scattering by the wayside where we got some wine the land on each side seemed to be but rocky and dry yet in many places we saw spots of green flourishing corn at farther distances there were small vineyards by the sides of the mountains intermixed with abundance of waste rocky land unfit for cultivation which afforded only dildobushes it was about   or   in the morning when we set out from santa cruz and it being fair clear weather the sun shone very bright and warmed us sufficiently before we got to the city laguna which we reached about  0 a clock all sweaty and tired and were glad to refresh our selves with a little wine in a sorry tiplinghouse but we soon found out one of the english merchants that resided here who entertained us handsomely at dinner and in the afternoon showed us the town  laguna is a pretty large wellcompacted town and makes a very agreeable prospect it stands part of it against a hill and part in a level the houses have mostly strong walls built with stone and covered with pantile they are not uniform yet they appear pleasant enough there are many fair buildings among which are   parishchurches   nunneries an hospital   convents and some chapels besides many gentlemens houses the convents are those of st austin st dominick st francis and st diego the two churches have pretty high square steeples which top the rest of the buildings the streets are not regular yet they are mostly spacious and pretty handsome and near the middle of the town is a large parade which has good buildings about it there is a strong prison on one side of it near which is a large conduit of good water that supplies all the town they have many gardens which are set round with oranges limes and other fruits in the middle of which are pot herbs sallading flowers etc and indeed if the inhabitants were curious this way they might have very pleasant gardens for as the town stands high from the sea on the brow of a plain that is all open to the east and has consequently the benefit of the true tradewind which blows here and is most commonly fair so there are seldom wanting at this town brisk cooling and refreshing breezes all the day  on the back of the town there is a large plain of   or   leagues in length and   miles wide producing a thick kindly sort of grass which looked green and very pleasant when i was there like our meadows in england in the spring on the east side of this plain very near the back of the town there is a natural lake or pond of fresh water it is about half a mile in circumference but being stagnant it is only used for cattle to drink of in the wintertime several sorts of wild fowl resort hither affording plenty of game to the inhabitants of laguna this city is called laguna from hence for that word in spanish signifies a lake or pond the plain is bounded on the w the n w and the s w with high steep hills as high above this plain as this is above the sea and it is from the foot of one of these mountains that the water of the conduit which supplies the town is conveyed over the plain in troughs of stone raised upon pillars and indeed considering the situation of the town its large prospect to the east for from hence you see the grand canary its gardens cool arbors pleasant plain green fields the pond and aqueduct and its refreshing breezes it is a very delightful dwelling especially for such as have not business that calls them far and often from home for the island being generally mountainous steep and craggy full of risings and fallings it is very troublesome traveling up and down in it unless in the cool of the mornings and evenings and mules and asses are most used by them both for riding and carriage as fittest for the stony uneven roads  beyond the mountains on the s w side still further up you may see from the town and plain a small peeked hill overlooking the rest this is that which is called the pike of teneriffe so much noted for its height but we saw it here at so great a disadvantage by reason of the nearness of the adjacent mountains to us that it looked inconsiderable in respect to its fame  the true malmesy wine grows in this island and this here is said to be the best of its kind in the world here is also canarywine and verdona or greenwine the canary grows chiefly on the west side of the island and therefore is commonly sent to oratavia which being the chief seaport for trade in the island the principal english merchants reside there with their consul because we have a great trade for this wine i was told that that town is bigger than laguna that it has but one church but many convents that the port is but ordinary at best and is very bad when the n w winds blow these norwesters give notice of their coming by a great sea that tumbles in on the shore for some time before they come and by a black sky in the n w upon these signs ships either get up their anchors or slip their cables and put to sea and ply off and on till the weather is over sometimes they are forced to do so   or   times before they can take in their lading which it is hard to do here in the fairest weather and for fresh water they send as i have said to santa cruz verdona is green strongbodied wine harsher and sharper than canary it is not so much esteemed in europe but is exported to the west indies and will keep best in hot countries for which reason i touched here to take in some of it for my voyage this sort of wine is made chiefly on the east side of the island and shipped off at santa cruz  besides these wines which are yearly vended in great plenty from the canary islands chiefly from grand canary teneriffe and palma here is store of grain as wheat barley and maiz which they often transport to other places they have also some beans and peace and coches a sort of grain much like maiz sowed mostly to satin land they have papahs which i shall speak more of hereafter apples pears plumbs cherries and excellent peaches apricocks guavas pomegranates citrons oranges lemons limes pumpkins onions the best in the world cabbages turnips potatos etc they are also well stocked with horses cows asses mules sheep goats hogs conies and plenty of deer the lancerot horses are said to be the most mettlesome fleet and loyal horses that are lastly here are many fowls as cocks and hens ducks pigeons patridges etc with plenty of fish as mackril etc all the canary islands have of these commodities and provisions more or less but as lancerota is most famed for horses and grand canary teneriffe and palma for wines teneriffe especially for the best malmesy for which reason these   islands have the chief trade so is forteventura for dunghilfowls and gomera for deer fowls and other eatables are dear on the trading islands but very plentiful and cheap on the other and therefore it is best for such ships as are going out on long voyages and who design to take in but little wine to touch rather at these last where also they may be supplied with wine enough and good cheap and for my own part if i had known it before i came hither i should have gone rather to one of those islands than to teneriffe but enough of this  it is reported they can raise   000 armed men on this island the governor or general as he is called of all the canary islands lives at laguna his name is don pedro de ponto he is a native of this island and was not long since president of panama in the south seas who bringing some very rich pearls from thence which he presented to the queen of spain was therefore as it is said made general of the canary islands the grand canary is an island much superior to teneriffe both in bulk and value but this gentleman chooses rather to reside in this his native island he has the character of a very worthy person and governs with moderation and justice being very well beloved  one of his deputies was the governor of santa cruz with whom i was to have dined but staying so long at laguna i came but time enough to sup with him he is a civil discreet man he resides in the main fort close by the sea there is a sentinel stands at his door and he has a few servants to wait on him i was treated in a large dark lower room which has but one small window there were about  00 muskets hung up against the walls and some pikes no wainscot hangings nor much furniture there was only a small old table a few old chairs and   or   pretty long forms to sit on having supped with him i invited him on board and went off in my boat the next morning he came aboard with another gentleman in his company attended by   servants but he was presently seasick and so much out of order that he could scarce eat or drink any thing but went quickly ashore again  having refreshed my men ashore and taken in what we had occasion for i sailed away from santa cruz on feb   in the afternoon hastening out all i could because the n e winds growing stormy made so great sea that the ship was scarce safe in the road and i was glad to get out though we left behind several goods we had bought and paid for for a boat could not go ashore and the stress was so great in weighing anchor that the cable broke i designed next for the i of mayo one of the c verd islands and ran away with a strong n e wind right before it all that night and the next day at the rate of  0 or    miles an hour when it slackened to a more moderate gale the canary islands are for their latitude within the usual verge of the true or general tradewind which i have observed to be on this side the equator n easterly but then lying not far from the african shore they are most subject to a n wind which is the coasting and constant trade sweeping that coast down as low as to c verd which spreading in breadth takes in mostly the canary islands though it be there interrupted frequently with the true tradewind n westwinds or other shifts of wind that islands are subject to especially where they lie many together the pike of teneriffe which had generally been clouded while we lay at santa cruz appeared now all white with snow hovering over the other hills but their height made it seem the less considerable for it looks most remarkable to ships that are to the westward of it we had brisk n n e and n e winds from teneriffe and saw flyingfish and a great deal of seathistle weed floating by the  th of feb at noon we were in the lat of    d   m so we steered away w n w for the i of mayo being by judgment not far to the e of it and at   a clock in the evening lay by till day the wind was then at w by s and so it continued all night fair weather and a small easy gale all these were great signs that we were near some land after having had such constant brisk winds before in the morning after sunrise we saw the island at about   leagues distance but it was so hazy over it that we could see but a small part of it yet even by that part i knew it to be the isle of mayo see how it appeared to us at several views as we were compassing the e the s e and the s of it to get to the road on the s w of it table ii no       and the road it self no    i got not in till the next day feb    when i come to an anchor in the road which is the leeward part of the island for it is a general rule never to anchor to windward of an island between the tropicks we anchored at    a clock in    fathom clean sand and very smooth water about three quarters of a mile from the depictions of the cape verd islands ble ii cape verd islands no   i mayo at   l did ye s point covered with a fog no   i mayo at these bearings then    fath red coral about i m from ye wsw beari no   i mayo standing away to ye sw point of it did   miles no   i mayo no   isle and town of st iago  shore in the same place where i anchored in my voyage round the world and found riding here the newport of london a merchant man captain barefoot commander who welcomed me with   guns and i returned one for thanks he came from fayal one of the western islands and had store of wine and brandy aboard he was taking in salt to carry to new foundland and was very glad to see one of the kings ships being before our coming afraid of pirates which of late years had much infested this and the rest of the cape verd islands  i have given some account of the island of mayo and of other of these islands in my voyage round the world vol i p  0 but i shall now add some further observations that occurred to me in this voyage the i of mayo is about   leagues in circumference of a roundish form with many small rocky points shooting out into the sea a mile or more its lat is    d n and as you sail about the isle when you come pretty nigh the shore you will see the water breaking off from those points which you must give a birth to and avoid them i sailed at this time two parts in three round the island but saw nothing dangerous besides these points and they all showed themselves by the breaking of the water yet it is reported that on the n and n n w side there are dangerous sholes that ly farther off at sea but i was not on that side there are   hills on this island of a considerable height one pretty bluff the other peeked at top the rest of the island is pretty level and of a good height from the sea the shore clear round has sandy bays between the rocky points i spoke of and the whole island is a very dry sort of soil  on the west side of the isle where the road for ships is there is a large sandy bay and a sandbank of about  0 paces wide within it which runs along the shore   or   miles within which there is a large salina or saltpond contained between the sandbank and the hills beyond it the whole salina is about   miles in length and half a mile wide but above one half of it is commonly dry the north end only of the pond never wants water producing salt from november till may which is here the dry season of the year the water which yields this salt works in from out of the sea through a hole in the sandbank before mentioned like a sluice and that only in springtides when it fills the pond more or less according to the height of the tides if there is any salt in the ponds when the flush of water comes in it presently dissolves but then in two or three days after it begins to kern and so continues kerning till either all or the greatest part of the salt water is congealed or kernd or till a fresh supply of it comes in again from the sea this water is known to come in only at that one passage on the n part of the pond where also it is deepest it was at a spring of the new moon when i was there and i was told that it comes in at no other time but at the new moon springtides but why that should be i cannot guess they who come hither to lade salt rake it up as it kerns and lay it in heaps on the dry land before the water breaks in anew and this is observable of this saltpond that the salt kerns only in the dry season contrary to the saltponds in the west indies particularly those of the island salttortuga which i have formerly mentioned vol i p    for they never kern there till the rains come in about april and continue to do so in may june july etc while the wet season lasts and not without some good shower of rain first but the reason also of this difference between the saltponds of mayo and those of the west indies why these should kern in the wet season and the former in the dry son i shall leave to philosophers  our nation drive here a great trade for salt and have commonly a man of war here for the guard of our ships and barks that come to take it in of which i have been informed that in some years there have not been less than  00 in a year it costs nothing but mens labor to rake it together and wheel it out of the pond except the carriage and that also is very cheap the inhabitants having plenty of asses for which they have little to do besides carrying the salt from the ponds to the seatide at the season when ships are here the inhabitants lade and drive their asses themselves being very glad to be employed for they have scarce any other trade but this to get a penny by the pond is not above half a mile from the landingplace so that the asses make a great many trips in a day they have a set number of turns to and fro both forenoon and afternoon which their owners will not exceed at the landingplace there lies a frapeboat as our seamen call it to take in the salt it is made purposely for this use with a deck reaching from the stern a third part of the boat where there is a kind of bulkhead that rises not from the boats bottom but from the edge of the deck to about   foot in height all calkd very tight the use of it is to keep the waves from dashing into the boat when it lies with its head to the shore to take in salt for here commonly runs a great sea and when the boat lies so with its head to the shore the sea breaks in over the stern and would soon fill it was it not for this bulkhead which stops the waves that come flowing upon the deck and makes them run off into the sea on each side to keep the boat thus with the head to the shore and the stern to the sea there are two strong stantions set up in the boat the one at the head the other in the middle of it against the bulkhead and a foot higher than the bulkhead there is a large notch cut in the top of each of these stantions big enough for a small hazer or rope to lie in one end of which is fastened to a post ashore and the other to a grapling or anchor lying a pretty way off at sea this rope serves to hale the boat in and out and the stantions serve to keep her fast so that she cannot swing to either side when the rope is haled tight for the sea would else fill her or toss her ashore and stave her the better to prevent her staving and to keep her the tighter together there are two sets of ropes more the first going athwart from gunnal to gunnal which when the rowers benches are laid bind the boats sides so hard against the ends of the benches that they cannot easily fall asunder while the benches and ropes mutually help each other the ropes keeping the boats sides from flying off and the benches from being crushed together inwards of these ropes there are usually but two dividing the boats length as they go across the sides into there equal parts the other set of ropes are more in number and are so placed as to keep the ribs and planks of the boat from starting off for this purpose there are holes made at certain distances through the edge of the keel that runs along on the inside of the boat through which these ropes passing are laid along the ribs so as to line them or be themselves as ribs upon them being made fast to them by rattans brought thither or small cords twisted close about both ropes and ribs up to the gunnal by which means though several of the nails or pegs of the boat should by any shock fall out yet the ropes of these two sets might hold her together especially with the help of a rope going quite round about the gunnal on the outside as our longboats have and such is the care taken to strengthen the boats from which girding them with ropes which our seamen call fraping they have the name of frapeboats two men suffice to hale her in and out and take in the salt from shore which is brought in bags and put it out again as soon as the boat is brought nigh enough to the shore he who stands by the bulkhead takes instantly a turn with the hazer about the bulkheadstantion and that stops her fast before the sea can turn her aside and when the two men have got in their lading they hale off to sea till they come a little without the swell where they remove the salt into another boat that carries it on board the ship without such a frapeboat here is but bad landing at any time for though it is commonly very smooth in the road yet there falls a great sea on the shore so that every ship that comes here should have such a boat and bring or make or borrow one of other ships that happen to be here for the inhabitants have none i have been thus particular in the description of these frapeboats because of the use they may be of in any places where a great sea falls in upon the shore as it does especially in many open roads in the east and west indies where they might therefore be very serviceable but i never saw any of them there  the island mayo is generally barren being dry as i said and the best of it is but a very indifferent soil the sandy bank that pens in the saltpond has a sort of silk cotton growing upon it and a plant that runs along upon the ground branching out like a vine but with thick broad leaves the silkcotton grows on tender shrubs   or   foot high in cods as big as an apple but of a long shape which when ripe open at one end parting leisurely into   quarters and at the first opening the cotton breaks forth it may be of use for stuffing of pillows or the like but else is of no value any more than that of the great cottontree i took of these cods before they were quite ripe and laid them in my chest and in two or three days they would open and throw out the cotton others i have bound fast with strings so that the cod could not open and in a few days after as soon as i slackned the string never so little the cod would burst and the cotton fly out forceably at a very little hole just as the pulp out of a roasting apple till all has been out of the cod i met with this sort of cotton afterward at timor where it was ripe in november and no where else in all my travels but i found two other sorts of silkcotton at brazil which i shall there describe the right cottonshrub grows here also but not on the sandbank i saw some bushes of it near the shore but the most of it is planted in the middle of the isle where the inhabitants live cottoncloth being their chief manufacture but neither is there any great store of this cotton there also are some trees within the island but none to be seen near the seaside nothing but a few bushes scattering up and down against the sides of the adjacent hills for as i said before the land is pretty high from the sea the soil is for the most part either a sort of sand or loose crumbling stone without any fresh water ponds or streams to moisten it but only showers in the wetseason which run off as fast as they fall except a small spring in the middle of the isle from which proceeds a little stream of water that runs through a valley between the hills there the inhabitants live in three small towns having a church and padre in each town and these towns as i was informed are   or   miles from the road pinose is said to be the chief town and to have two churches st johns the next and the third lagoa the houses are very mean small low things they build with fig tree here being as i was told no other trees fit to build with the rafters are a sort of wild cane the fruits of this isle are chiefly figs and watermelons they have also callavances a sort of pulse like french beans and pumpkins for ordinary food the fowls are flamingos great curlews and guineahens which the natives of those islands call gallena pintada or the painted hen but in jamaica where i have seen also those birds in the dry savannahs and woods for they love to run about in such places they are called guineahens they seem to be much of the nature of partridges they are bigger than our hens have long legs and will run apace they can fly too but not far having large heavy bodies and but short wings and short tails as i have generally observed that birds have seldom long tails unless such as fly much in which their tails are usually serviceable to their turning about as a rudder to a ship or boat these birds have thick and strong yet sharp bills pretty long claws and short tails they feed on the ground either on worms which they find by tearing open the earth or on grasshoppers which are plentiful here the feathers of these birds are speckled with dark and light gray the spots so regular and uniform that they look more beautiful than many birds that are decked with gayer feathers their necks are small and long their heads also but little the cocks have a small rising on their crowns like a sort of a comb it is of the color of a dry wall nutshell and very hard they have a small red gill on each side of their heads like ears strutting out downwards but the hens have none they are so strong that one cannot hold them and very hardy they are very good meat tender and sweet and in some the flesh is extraordinary white though some others have black flesh but both sorts are very good the natives take them with dogs running them down whenever they please for here are abundance of them you shall see   or  00 in a company i had several brought aboard alive where they throve very well some of them    or    months when they began to pine when they are taken young they will become tame like our hens the flamingos i have already described at large vol i p    they have also many other sort of fowls viz pigeons and turtledoves miniotas a sort of landfowls as big as crows of a gray color and good food crusias another sort of greycolourd fowl almost as big as a crow which are only seen in the night probably a sort of owls and are said to be good for consumptive people but eaten by none else rabeks a sort of large gray eatable fowls with long necks and legs not unlike herons and many kinds of small bitds  of landanimals here are goats as i said formerly and asses good store when i was here before they were said to have had a great many bulls and cows but the pirates who have since miserably infested all these islands have much lessened the number of those not having spared the inhabitants themselves for at my being there this time the governor of mayo was but newly returned from being a prisoner among them they having taken him away and carried him about with them for a year or two  the sea is plentifully stocked with fish of diverse sorts viz dolphins bonetas mullets snappers silverfish garfish etc and here is a good bay to hale a sain or net in i haled mine several times and to good purpose dragging ashore at one time   dozen of great fish most of them large mullets of a foot and a half or two foot long here are also porposes and a small sort of whales that commonly visit this road every day i have already said vol i p    that the months of may june july and august that is the wet season are the time when the green turtle come hither and go ashore to lay their eggs i look upon it as a thing worth taking notice of that the turtle should always both in north and south latitude lay their eggs in the wet months it might be thought considering what great rains there are then in some places where these creatures lay that their eggs should be spoiled by them but the rain though violent is soon soaked up by the sand wherein the eggs are buried and perhaps sinks not so deep into it as the eggs are laid and keeping down the heat may make the sand hotter below than it was before like a hotbed whatever the reason may be why providence determines these creatures to this season of laying their eggs rather than the dry in fact it is so as i have constantly observed and that not only with the seaturtle but with all other sorts of amphibious animals that lay eggs as crocodils alligators guanos etc the inhabitants of this island even their governor and padres are all negros woolpated like their africanneighbours from whom it is like they are descended though being subjects to the portuguese they have their religion and language they are stout lusty welllimbd people both men and women fat and fleshy and they and their children as round and plump as little porposes though the island appears so barren to a stranger as scarce to have food for its inhabitants i inquired how many people there might be on the isle and was told by one of the padres that here were   0 souls in all the negrogovernor has his patent from the portuguese governor of st jago he is a very civil and sensible poor man and they are generally a good sort of people he expects a small present from every commander that lades salt here and is glad to be invited aboard their ships he spends most of his time with the english in the salting season which is his harvest and indeed all the islanders are then fully employed in getting somewhat for they have no vessels of their own to trade with nor do any portuguesevessels come hither scarce any but english on whom they depend for trade and though subjects of portugal have a particular value for us we dont pay them for their salt but for the labor of themselves and their beasts in lading it for which we give them victuals some money and old clothes viz hats shirts and other clothes by which means many of them are indifferently well rigged but some of them go almost naked when the turtleseason comes in they watch the sandybays in the night to turn them and having small huts at particular places on the bays to keep them from the rain and to sleep in and this is another harvest they have for food for by report there come a great many turtle to this and the rest of the cape verd islands when the turtle season is over they have little to do but to hunt for guineahens and manage their small plantations but by these means they have all the year some employment or other whereby they get a subsistence though but little else when any of them are desirous to go over to st jago they get a license from the governor and desire passage in any english ship that is going thither and indeed all ships that lade salt here will be obliged to touch at st jago for water for here at the bay is none not so much as for drinking it is true there is a small well of brackish water not half a mile from the landingplace which the asses that carry salt drink at but it is very bad water asses themselves are a commodity in some of these islands several of our ships coming hither purposely to freight with them and carry them to barbados and our other plantations i stayed at mayo   days and got   or   tun of salt aboard for my voyage in which time there came also into this road several sail of merchants ships for salt all bound with it for newfoundland  the   th day of february at about one a clock in the morning i weighed from mayoroad in order to water at st jago which was about   or   leagues to the westward we coasted along the island st jago and past by the port on the east of it i mentioned formerly vol i p    which they call praya where some english outwardbound east india men still touch but not so many of them as heretofore we saw the fort upon the hill the houses and coconut trees but i would not go in to anchor here because i expected better water on the s w of the island at st jago town by   a clock in the morning we saw the ships in that road being within   leagues of it but were forced to keep turning many hours to get in the flaws of wind coming so uncertain as they do especially to the leeward of islands that are high land at length two portuguese boats came off to help tow us in and about   a clock in the afternoon we came to an anchor and took the prospect of the town table ii no   we found here besides two portugueseships bound for brazil whose boats had towed us in an english pink that had taken in asses at one of the cape verd islands and was bound to barbados with them next morning i went ashore with my officers to the governor who treated us with sweetmeats i told him the occasion of my coming was chiefly for water and that i desired also to take in some refreshments of fowls etc he said i was welcome and that he would order the townsmen to bring their commodities to a certain house where i might purchase what i had occasion for i told him i had not money but would exchange some of the salt which i brought from mayo for their commodities he replied that salt was indeed an acceptable commodity with the poor people but that if i designed to buy any cattle i must give money for them i contented my self with taking in dunghill fowls the governor ordering a crier to go about the town and give notice to the people that they might repair to such a place with fowls and maiz for feeding them where they might get salt in exchange for them so i sent on board for salt and ordered some of my men to truck the same for the fowls and maiz while the rest of them were busy in filling of water this is the effect of their keeping no boats of their own on the several islands that they are glad to buy even their own salt of foreigners for want of being able to transport it themselves from island to island  st jago town lies on the s w part of the island in lat about    degrees n and is the seat of the general governor and of the bishop of all the cape verd islands this town stands scattering against the sides of two mountains between which there is a deep valley which is about  00 yards wide against the sea but within a quarter of a mile it closes up so as not to be  0 yards wide in the valley by the sea there is a straggling street houses on each side and a run of water in the bottom which empties it self into a fine small cove or sandy bay where the sea is commonly very smooth so that here is good watring and good landing at any time though the road be rocky and bad for ships just by the landingplace there is a small fort almost level with the sea where is always a court of guard kept on the top of the hill above the town there is another fort which by the wall that is to be seen from the road seems to be a large place they have canon mounted there but how many i know not neither what use that fort can be of except it be for salutes the town may consist of   or  00 houses all built of rough stone having also one convent and one church  the people in general are black or at least of a mixed color except only some few of the better sort viz the governor the bishop some gentlemen and some of the padres for some of these also are black the people about praya are thievish but these of st jagotown living under their governors eye are more orderly though generally poor having little trade yet besides chance ships of other nations there come hither a portuguese ship or two every year in their way to brazil these vend among them a few european commodies and take of their principal manufactures viz striped cottoncloth which they carry with them to brazil here is also another ship comes hither from portugal for sugar their other manufacture and returns with it directly thither for it is reported that there are several small sugarworks on this island from which they send home near  00 tun every year and they have plenty of cotton growing up in the country wherewith they cloth themselves and send also a great deal to brazil they have vines of which they make some wine but the european ships furnish them with better though they drink but little of any their chief fruits are besides plantains in abundance oranges lemons citrons melons both musk and watermelons limes guavas pomgranates quinces custardapples and papahs etc  the custardapple as we call it is a fruit as big as a pomegranate and much of the same color the outside husk shell or rind is for substance and thickness between the shell of a pomegranate and the peel of a sevilorange softer than this yet more brittle than that the coat or covering is also remarkable in that it is beset round with small regular knobs or risings and the inside of the fruit is full of a white soft pulp sweet and very pleasant and most resembling a custard of any thing both in color and taste from whence probably it is called a custardapple by our english it has in the middle a few small black stones or kernels but no core for it is all pulp the tree that bears this fruit is about the bigness of a quincetree with long small and thickset branches spread much abroad at the extremity of here and there one of which the fruit grows upon a stalk of its own about   or  0 inches long slender and tough and hanging down with its own weight a large tree of this sort does not bear usually above  0 or  0 apples seldom more this fruit grows in most countries within the tropicks i have seen of them though i omitted the description of them before all over the west indies both continent and islands as also in brazil and in the east indies  the papah too is found in all these countries though i have not hitherto described it it is a fruit about the bigness of a muskmelon hollow as that is and much resembling it in shape and color both outside and inside only in the middle instead of flat kernels which the melons have these have a handful of small blackish seeds about the bigness of peppercorns whose taste is also hot on the tongue somewhat like pepper the fruit it self is sweet soft and luscious when ripe but while green it is hard and unfavory though even then being boiled and eaten with saltpork or beef it serves instead of turnips and is as much esteemed the papahtree is about  0 or    foot high the body near the ground may be a foot and an half or   foot diameter and it grows up tapering to the top it has no branches at all but only large leaves growing immediately upon stalks from the body the leaves are of a roundish form and jagd about the edges having their stalks or stumps longer or shorter as they grow near or further from the top they begin to spring from out of the body of the tree at about   or   foot height from the ground the trunk being bare below but above that the leaves grow thicker and larger still toward its top where they are close and broad the fruit grows only among the leaves and thickest among the thickest of them insomuch that toward the top of the tree the papahs springs forth from its body as thick as they can stick one by another but then lower down where the leaves are thinner the fruit is larger and of the size i have described and at the top where they are thick they are but small and no bigger than ordinary turnips yet tasted like the rest  their chief landanimals are their bullocks which are said to be many though they asked us  0 dollars apiece for them they have also horses asses and mules deer goats hogs and blackfacd longtaild monkeys of fowls they have cocks and hens ducks guineahens both tame and wild parakites parrots pigeons turtledoves herons hawks crabcatchers galdens a larger sort of crabcatchers curlews etc their fish is the same as at mayo and the rest of these islands and for the most part these islands have the same beasts and birds also but some of the isles have pasturage and employment for some particular beasts more than other and the birds are encouraged by woods for shelter and maiz and fruits sor food to flock rather to some of the islands as to this of st jago than to others  st jago road is one of the worst that i have been in there is not clean ground enough for above   ships and those also must lie very near each other one even of these must lie close to the shore with a landfast there and that is the best for a small ship i should not have come in here if i had not been told that it was a good secure place but i found it so much otherways that i was in pain to be gone captain baresool who came to an anchor while i was here in oul ground lost quickly   anchors and i had lost a small one the island fogo shows its self from this road very plain at about   or

to touch once more at a cultivated place in these seas where my men might be refreshed and might have a market wherein to furnish themselves with necessaries for designing that my next stretch should be quite to n holland and knowing that after so long a run nothing was to be expected there but fresh water if i could meet even with that there i resolved upon putting in first at some port of brazil and to provide my self there with whatever i might have further occasion for beside the refreshing and furnishing my men i aimed also at the inuring them gradually and by intervals to the fatigues that were to be expected in the remainder of the voyage which was to be in a part of the world they were altogether strangers to none of them except two young men having ever crosst the line  with this design i sailed from st jago on the   d of february with the winds at e n e and n e fair weather and a brisk gale we steered away s s e and s s e half east till in the lat of   degrees  0 min we met with many riplings in the sea like a tide or strong current which setting against the wind caused such a ripling we continued to meet these currents from that lat till we came into the lat of   degrees    n when they ceased during this time we saw some bonetas and sharks catching one of these we had the true general tradewind blowing fresh at n e till in the lat of   degrees  0 min n when the wind varied and we had small gales with some tornadoes we were then to the east of st jago   degrees    min when we got into lat   degrees   min n where i said the ripling ceased and long to the east of st jago   degrees   min we had the wind whiffling between the s by e and e by n small gales frequent calms very black clouds with much rain in the lat of   degrees   min n and long e from st jago   degrees   min we had the wind from the s s e to the n n e faint and often interrupted with calms while we had calms we had the opportunity of trying the current we had met with hitherto and found that it set n e by e half a knot which is    mile in    hours so that here it ran at the rate of half a mile an hour and had been much stronger before the rains held us by intervals till the lat of   degrees 0 min n with small gales of wind between s s e and s e by e and sometimes calm afterward we had the wind between the s and s s e till we crosst the line small winds calms and pretty fair weather we saw but few fish beside porposes but of them a great many and struck one of them  it was the  0th day of march about the time of the equinox when we crosst the equator having had all along from the lat of   degrees  0 min n where the true tradewind left us a great swell out of the s e and but small uncertain gales mostly southerly so that we crept to the southward but slowly i kept up against these as well as i could to the southward and when we had now and then a flurry of wind at e i still went away due south purposely to get to the southward as fast as i could for while near the line i expected to have but uncertain winds frequent calms rains tornadoes etc which would not only retard my course but endanger sickness also among my men especially those who were ill provided with clothes or were too lazy to shift themselves when they were drenched with the rains the heat of the weather made them careless of doing this but taking a dram of brandy which i gave them when wet with a charge to shift themselves they would however lie down in their hammocks with their wet clothes so that when they turned out they caused an ill smell wherever they came and their hammocks would stink sufficiently that i think the remedying of this is worth the care of commanders that cross the line especially when they are it may be a month or more ever they get out of the rains at some times of the year as in june july or august  what i have here said about the currents winds calms etc in this passage is chiefly for the farther illustration of what i have heretofore observed in general about these matters and especially as to crossing the line in my discourse of the winds etc in the torrid zone see vol ii part   p     which observations i have had very much confirmed to me in the course of this voyage and i shall particularize in several of the chief of them as they come in my way and indeed i think i may say this of the main of the observations in that treatise that the clear satisfaction i had about them and how much i might rely upon them was a great ease to my mind during this vexatious voyage wherein the ignorance and obstinacy withal of some under me occasioned me a great deal of tronble though they found all along and were often forced to acknowledge it that i was seldom out in my conjectures when i told them usually beforehand what winds etc we should meet with at such or such particular places we should come at  pernambuc was the port that i designed for at my first setting out from st jago it being a place most proper for my purpose by reason of its situation lying near the extremity of c st augustine the easternmost promontory of brazil by which means it not only enjoys the greater benefit of the seabreezes and is consequently more healthy than other places to the southward but is withal less subject to the southerly coastingtradewinds that blow half the year on this shore which were now drawing on and might be troublesome to me so that i might both hope to reach soonest pernambuc as most directly and nearest in my run and might thence also more easily get away to the southward than from bahia de todos los santos or ria janeira  but notwithstanding these advantages i proposed to my self in going to pernambuc i was soon put by that design through the refractoriness of some under me and the discontents and backwardness of some of my men for the calms and shiftings of wind which i met with as i was to expect in crossing the line made them who were unacquainted with these matters almost heartless as to the persuit of the voyage as thinking we should never be able to weather c st augustine and though i told them that by that time we should get to about three degrees south of the line we should again have a true brisk general tradewind from the north east that would carry us to what part of brazil we pleased yet they would not believe it till they found it so this with some other unforeseen accidents not necessary to be mentioned in this place meeting with the aversion of my men to a long unknown voyage made me justly apprehensive of their revolting and was a great trouble and hindrance to me so that i was obliged partly to alter my measures and met with many difficulties the particulars of which i shall not trouble the reader with but i mention thus much of it in general for my own necessary vindication in my taking such measures sometimes for prosecuting the voyage as the state of my ships crew rather than my own judgment and experience determined me to the disorders of my ship made me think at present that pernambuc would not be so fit a place for me being told that ships ride there two or three leagues from the town under the command of no forts so that whenever i should have been ashore it might have been easy for my discontented crew to have cut or slipped their cables and have gone away from me many of them discovering already an intention to return to england and some of them declaring openly that they would go no further onwards than brazil i altered my course therefore and stood away for bahio de todos los santos or the bay of all saints where i hoped to have the governors help if need should require for securing my ship from any such mutinous attempt being forced to keep my self all the way upon my guard and to lie with my officers such as i could trust and with small arms upon the quarter deck it scarce being safe for me to lie in my cabin by reason of the discontents among my men  on the   d of march we saw the land of brazil having had thither from the time when we came into the true tradewind again after crossing the line very fair weather and brisk gales mostly at e n e the land we saw was about  0 leagues to the north of bahia so i coasted along shore to the southward this coast is rather low than high with sandybays all along by the sea  a little within land are many very white spots of sand appearing like snow and the coast looks very pleasant being checkered with woods and savanahs the trees in general are not tall but they are green and flourishing there are many small houses by the seaside whose inhabitants are chiefly fishermen they come off to sea on barklogs made of several logs fastened side to side that have one or two masts with sails to them there are two men in each barklog one at either end having small low benches raised a little above the logs to sit and fish on and two baskets hanging up at the mast or masts one to put their provisions in the other for their fish many of these were a fishing now and two of them came aboard of whom i bought some fish in the afternoon we sailed by one very remarkable piece of land where on a small pleasant hill there was a church dedicated to the virgin mary see a sight of some parts of this coast table iii no           and of the hill the church stands on table iii no    i coasted along till the evening and then brought to and lay by till the next morning about   hours after we were brought to there came a sail out of the offin from seaward and lay by about a mile to windward of us and so lay all night in the morning upon speaking with her she proved to be a portuguese ship bound to bahia therefore i sent my boat aboard and desired to have one of his mates to pilot me in he answered that he had not a mate capable of it but that he would sail in before me and show me the way and that if he went in to the harbor in the night he would hang out a light for me he said we had not far in and might reach it before night with a tolerable gale but that with so small an one as now we had we could not do it so we jogd on till night and then he accordingly hung out his light which we steered after sounding as we went in i kept all my men on deck and had an anchor ready to let go on occasion we had the tide of ebb against us so that we went in but slowly and it was about the middle of the night when we anchored immediately the portuguese master came

the table  aboard to see me to whom i returned thanks for his civilities and indeed i found much respect not only from this gentleman but from all of that nation both here and in other places who were ready to serve me on all occasions the place that we anchored in was about two miles from the harbor where the ships generally ride but the fear i had lest my people should run away with the ship made me hasten to get a license from the governor to run up into the harbor and ride among their ships close by one of their forts so on the   th of march about  0 a clock in the morning the tide serving i went thither being piloted by the superintendant there whose business it is to carry up all the king of portugals ships that come hither and to see them well moored he brought us to an anchor right against the town at the outer part of the harbor which was then full of ships within   0 yards of a small fort that stands on a rock half a mile from the shore see a prospect of the harbor and the town as it appeared to us while we lay at anchor table iii no    bahia de todos los santos lies in lat    degrees s it is the most considerable town in brazil whether in respect of the beauty of its buildings its bulk or its trade and revenue it has the convenience of a good harbor that is capable of receiving ships of the greatest burden the entrance of which is guarded with a strong fort standing without the harbor called st antonio a sight of which i have given table iii no   as it appeared to us the afternoon before we came in and its lights which they hang out purposely for ships we saw the same night there are other smaller forts that command the harbor one of which stands on a rock in the sea about half a mile from the shore close by this fort all ships must pass that anchor here and must ride also within half a mile of it at farthest between this and another fort that stands on a point at the inner part of the harbor and is called the dutch fort but must ride nearest to the former all along against the town where there is good holding ground and less exposed to the southerly winds that blow very hard here they commonly set in about april but blow hardest in may june july and august but the place where the ships ride is exposed to these winds not above   points of the compass  beside these there is another fort fronting the harbor and standing on the hill upon which the town stands the town it self consists of about  000 houses the major part of which cannot be seen from the harbor but so many as appear in sight with a great mixture of trees between them and all placed on a rising hill make a very pleasant prospect as may be judged by the draught table iii no    there are in the town    churches chapels hospitals convents beside one nunnery viz the ecclesia major or cathedral the jesuits college which are the chief and both in sight from the harbor st antonio sta barbara both parishchurches the franciscans church and the dominicans and two convents of carmelites a chapel for seamen close by the seaside where boats commonly land and the seamen go immediately to prayers another chapel for poor people at the farther end of the same street which runs along by the shore and a third chapel for soldiers at the edge of the town remote from the sea and an hospital in the middle of the town the nunnery stands at the outeredge of the town next the fields wherein by report there are  0 nuns here lives an archbishop who has a fine palace in the town and the governors palace is a fair stonebuilding and looks handsome to the sea though but indifferently furnished within both spaniards and portuguese in their plantations abroad as i have generally observed affecting to have large houses but are little curious about furniture except pictures some of them the houses of the town are   or   stories high the walls thick and strong being built with stone with a covering of pantile and many of them have balconies the principal streets are large and all of them paved or pitched with small stones there are also parades in the most eminent places of the town and many gardens as well within the town as in the outparts of it wherein are fruit trees herbs salladings and flowers in great variety but ordered with no great care nor art  the governor who resides here is called don john de lancastario being descended as they say from our english lancaster family and he has a respect for our nation on that account calling them his countrymen i waited on him several times and always found him very courteous and civil here are about  00 soldiers in garrison they commonly draw up and exercise in a large parade before the governors house and many of them attend him when he goes abroad the soldiers are decently clad in brown linen which in these hot countries is sar better than woollen but i never saw any clad in linen but only these beside the soldiers in pay he can soon have some thousands of men up in arms on occasion the magazine is on the skirts of the town on a small rising between the nunnery and the soldiers church it is big enough to hold   or  000 barrels of powder but i was told it seldom has more than  00 sometimes but  0 there are always a band of soldiers to guard it and sentinels looking out both day and night  a great many merchants always reside at bahia for it is a place of great trade i found here above  0 great ships from europe with two of the king of portugals ships of war for their convoy beside two ships that traded to africa only either to angola gamba or other places on the coast of guinea and abundance of small craft that only run to and fro on this coast carrying commodities from one part of brazil to another  the merchants that live here are said to be rich and to have many negro slaves in their houses both of men and women themselves are chiefly portuguese foreigners having but little commerce with them yet here was one mr cock an english merchant a very civil gentleman and of good repute he had a patent to be our english consul but did not care to take upon him any public character because english ships seldom come hither here having been none in    or    years before this time here was also a dane and a french merchant or two but all have their effects transported to and from europe in portuguese ships none of any other nation being admitted to trade hither there is a customhouse by the seaside where all goods imported or exported are entered and to prevent abuses there are   or   boats that take their turns to row about the harbor searching any boats they suspect to be running of goods  the chief commodities that the european ships bring hither are linnencloaths both course and fine some woollens also as bays searges perpetuanas etc hats stockings both of silk and thread bisketbread wheat flour wine chiefly port oilolive butter cheese etc and saltbeef and pork would there also be good commodities they bring hither also iron and all sorts of irontools pewtervessels of all sorts as dishes plates spoons etc lookingglasses beads and other toys and the ships that touch at st jago bring thence as i said cotton cloth which is afterward sent to angola  the european ships carry from hence sugar tobacco either in roll or snuff never in leaf that i know of these are the staple commodities besides which here are dyewoods as fustick etc with woods for other uses as speckled wood brazil etc they also carry home raw hides tallow trainoil of whales etc here are also kept tame monkeys parrots parakites etc which the seamen carry home  the sugar of this country is much better than that which we bring home from our plantations for all the sugar that is made here is clayd which makes it whiter and finer than our muscovada as we call our unrefind sugar our planters seldom refine any with clay unless sometimes a little to send home as presents for their friends in england their way of doing it is by taking some of the whitest clay and mixing it with water till it is like cream with this they fill up the pans of sugar that are sunk   or   inches below the brim by the draining of the molosses out of it first scraping off the thin hard crust of the sugar that lies at the top and would hinder the water of the clay from soaking through the sugar of the pan the refining is made by this percolation for  0 or    days time that the clayish liquor lies soaking down the pan the white water whitens the sugar as it passes through it and the gross body of the clay it self grows hard on the top and may be taken off at pleasure when scraping off with a knife the very upper part of the sugar which will be a little sullied that which is underneath will be white almost to the bottom and such as is called brazil sugar is thus whitened when i was here this sugar was sold for  0 s per  00 lb and the bottoms of the pots which is very course sugar for about  0 s per  00 lb both sorts being then scarce for here was not enough to lade the ships and therefore some of them were to lie here till the next season  the european ships commonly arrive here in february or march and they have generally quick passages finding at that time of the year brisk gales to bring them to the line little trouble then in crossing it and brisk e n e winds afterward to bring them hither they commonly return from hence about the latter end of may or in june twas said when i was here that the ships would sail hence the  0th day of may and therefore they were all very busy some in taking in their goods others in careening and making themselves ready the ships that come hither usually careen at their first coming here being a hulk belonging to the king for that purpose this hulk is under the charge of the superintendent i spoke of who has a certain sum of money for every ship that careens by her he also provides firing and other necessaries for that purpose and the ships do commonly hire of the merchants here each   cables to moor by all the time they lie here and so save their own hempen cables for these are made of a sort of hair that grows on a certain kind of trees hanging down from the top of their bodies and is very like the black coyre in the east indies if not the same these cables are strong and lasting and so much for the european ships  the ships that use the guineatrade are small vessels in comparison of the former they carry out from hence rum sugar the cottoncloaths of st jago beads etc and bring in return gold ivory and slaves making very good returns  the small craft that belong to this town are chiefly employed in carrying european goods from bahia the center of the brasilian trade to the other places on this coast bringing back hither sugar tobacco etc they are sailed chiefly with negroslaves and about christmas these are mostly employed in whalekilling for about that time of the year a sort whales as they call them are very thick on this coast they come in also into the harbors and inland lakes where the seamen go out and kill them the fat of them is boiled to oil the lean is eaten by the slaves and poor people and i was told by one that had frequently eaten of it that the flesh was very sweet and wholesome these are said to be but small whales yet here are so many and so easily killed that they get a great deal of money by it those that strike them buy their license for it of the king and i was informed that he receives  0000 dollars per annum for this fishery all the small vessels that use this coasting traffic are built here and so are some men of war also for the kingsservice there was one a building when i was here a ship of  0 or  0 guns and the timber of this country is very good and proper for this purpose i was told it was very strong and more durable than any we have in europe and they have enough of it as for their ships that use the european trade some of them that i saw there were english built taken from us by the french during the late war and sold by them to the portugese  besides merchants and others that trade by sea from this port here are other pretty wealthy men and several artificers and tradesmen of most sorts who by labor and industry maintain themselves very well especially such as can arrive at the purchase of a negroslave or two and indeed excepting people of the lowest degree of all here are scarce any but what keep slaves in their houses the richer sort besides the slaves of both sexes whom they keep for servile uses in their houses have menslaves who wait on them abroad for state either running by their horsessides when they ride out or to carry them to and fro on their shoulders in the town when they make short visits near home every gentleman or merchant is provided with things necessary for this sort of carriage the main thing is a pretty large cotton hammock of the west india fashion but mostly dyed blue with large fringes of the same hanging down on each side this is carried on the negros shoulders by the help of a bambo about    or    foot long to which the hammock is hung and a covering comes over the pole hanging down on each side like a curtain so that the person so carried cannot be seen unless he pleases but may either ly down having pillows for his head or may sit up by being a little supported with these pillows and by letting both his legs hang out over one side of the hammock when he has a mind to be seen he puts by his curtain and salutes every one of his acquaintance whom he meets in the streets for they take a piece of pride in greeting one another from their hammocks and will hold long conferences thus in the streets but then their two slaves who carry the hammock have each a strong wellmade staff with a fine iron fork at the upper end and a sharp iron below like the rest for a musket which they stick fast in the ground and let the pole or bambo of the hammock rest upon them till their masters business or the complement is over there is scarce a man of any fashion especially a woman will pass the streets but so carried in a hammock the chief mechanic traders here are smiths hatters shoemakers tanners sawyers carpenters coopers etc here are also tailors butchers etc which last kill the bullocks very dexterously sticking them at one blow with a sharppointed knife in the nape of the neck having first drawn them close to a rail but they dress them very slovenly it being lent when i came hither there was no buying any flesh till eastereve when a great number of bullocks were killed at once in the slaughterhouses within the town men women and children flocking thither with great joy to buy and a multitude of dogs almost starved following them for whom the meat seemed fittest it was so lean all these tradesmen buy negros and train them up to their several employments which is a great help to them and they having so frequent trade to angola and other parts of guinea they have a constant supply of blacks both for their plantations and town these slaves are very useful in this place for carriage as porters for as here is a great trade by sea and the landingplace is at the foot of a hill too steep for drawing with carts so there is great need of slaves to carry goods up into the town especially for the inferior sort but the merchants have also the convenience of a great crane that goes with ropes or pullees one end of which goes up while the other goes down the house in which this crane is stands on the brow of the hill toward the sea hanging over the precipice and there are planks set shelving against the bank from thence to the bottom against which the goods lean or slide as they are hoisted up or let down the negroslaves in this town are so numerous that they make up the greatest part or bulk of the inhabitants every house as i said having some both men and women of them many of the portuguese who are batchelors keep of these black women for misses though they know the danger they are in of being poisoned by them if ever they give them any occasion of jealousy a gentleman of my acquaintance who had been familiar with his cookmaid lay under some such apprehensions from her when i was there these slaves also of either sex will easily be engaged to do any sort of mischief even to murder if they are hired to do it especially in the night for which reason i kept my men on board as much as i could for one of the french kings ships being here had several men murdered by them in the night as i was credibly informed  having given this account of the town of bahia i shall next say somewhat of the country there is a salt water lake runs  0 leagues as i was told up the country n w from the sea leaving the town and dutch fort on the starboard fide the country all round about is for the most part a pretty flat even ground not high nor yet very low it is well watered with rivers brooks and springs neither wants it for good harbors navigable creeks and good bays for ships to ride in the soil in general is good naturally producing very latge trees of diverse sorts and fit for any uses the savannahs also are laden with grass herbs and many sorts of smaller vegetables and being cultivated produce any thing that is proper for those hot countries as sugarcanes cotton indico tobacco maiz fruit trees of several kinds and eatable roots of all sorts of the several kinds of trees that are here i shall give an account of some as i had it partly from an inhabitant of bahia and partly from my knowledge of them otherwise viz sapiera vermiatico comesserie guitteba serrie as they were pronounced to me three sorts of mangrove speckled wood fustick cottontrees of three sorts etc together with fruit trees of diverse sorts that grow wild beside such as are planted  of timber trees the sapiera is said to be large and tall it is very good timber and is made use of in building of houses so is the vermiatico a tall streightbodied tree of which they make plank   foot broad and they also make canoas with it comesserie and guitteba are chiesly used in building ships these are as much esteemed here as oaks are in england and they say either sort is harder and more durable than oak the serrie is a sort of tree much like elm very durable in water here are also all the three sorts of mangrove trees viz the red the white and the black which i have described  vol i p    the bark of the red mangrove is here used for tanning of leather and they have great tanpits for it the black mangrove grows larger here than in the west indies and of it they make good plank the white mangrove is larger and tougher than in the west indies of these they make masts and yards for barks  there grow here wild or bastard coco nut trees neither so large nor so tall as the common ones in the east or west indies they bear nuts as the others but not a quarter so big as the right coconuts the shell is full of kernel without any hollow place or water in it and the kernel is sweet and wholesome but very hard both for the teeth and for digestion these nuts are in much esteem for making beads for paternosters boles of tobaccopipes and other toys and every small shop here has a great many of them to sell at the top of these bastard cocotrees among the branches there grows a sort of long black thread like horsehair but much longer which by the portuguese is called tresabo of this they make cables which are very serviceable strong and lasting for they will not rot as cables made of hemp though they ly exposed both to wet and heat these are the cables which i said they keep in their harbors here to let to hire to european ships and resemble the coyrecables  here are three sorts of cotton trees that bear silkcotton one sort is such as i have formerly described vol i p     by the name of the cottontree the other two sorts i never saw any where but here the trees of these latter sorts are but small in comparison of the former which are reckoned the biggest in all the west india woods yet are however of a good bigness and height one of these last sorts is not so full of branches as the other of them neither do they produce their fruit the same time of the year for one sort had its fruit just ripe and was shedding its leaves while the other sort was yet green and its fruit small and growing having but newly done blossoming the tree being as full of young fruit as an apple tree ordinarily in england these last yield very large pods about   inches long and as big as a mans arm it is ripe in september and october then the pod opens and the cotton bursts out in a great lump as big as a mans head they gather these pods before they open otherways it would fly all away it opens as well after it is gathered and then they take out the cotton and preserve it to sill pillows and bolsters for which use it is very much esteemed but it is fit for nothing else being so short that it cannot be spun it is of a tawney color and the seeds are black very round and as big as a white pea the other sort is ripe in march or april the fruit or pod is like a large apple and very round the outside shell is as thick as the top of ones finger within this there is a very thin whitish bag or skin which incloseth the cotton when the cottonapple is ripe the outer thick green shell splits it self into   equal parts from stemb to tail and drops off leaving the cotton hanging upon the stemb only pent up in its fine bag a day or two afterward the cotton swells by the heat of the sun breaks the bag and bursts out as big as a mans head and then as the wind blows it is by degrees driven away a little at a time out of the bag that still hangs upon the stemb and is scattered about the fields the bag soon following the cotton and the stemb the bag here is also a little of the right west india cotton shrub but none of the cotton is exported nor do they make much cloth of it  this country produces great variety of fine fruits as very good oranges of   or   sorts especially one sort of china oranges limes in abundance pomgranets pomecitrons plantains bonanos right coconuts guavas cocoplumbs called here munsheroos wildgrapes such as i have described vol ii part   p    beside such grapes as grow in europe here are also hogplumbs custardapples soursops cashews papahs called here mamoons jennipahs called here jennipapahs manchineelapples and mangos mangos are yet but rare here i saw none of them but in the jesuits garden which has a great many fine fruits and some cinamontrees these both of them were first brought from the east indies and they thrive here very well so do pumplemusses brought also from thence and both china and sevil oranges are here very plentiful as well as good  the soursop as we call it is a large fruit as big as a mans head of a long or oval shape and of a green color but one side is yellowish when ripe the outside rind or coat is pretty thick and very rough with small sharp knobs the inside is full of spungy pulp within which also are many black seeds or kernels in shape and bigness like a pumkinseed the pulp is very juicy of a pleasant taste and wholesome you suck the juice out of the pulp and so spit it out the tree or shrub that bears this fruit grows about  0 or    foot high with a small short body the branches growing pretty strait up for i did never see any of them spread abroad the twigs are slender and tough and so is the stemb of the fruit this fruit grows also both in the east and west indies  the cashew is a fruit as big as a pippin pretty long and bigger near the stemb than at the other end growing tapering the rind is smooth and thin of a red and yellow color the seed of this fruit grows at the end of it it is of an olive color shaped like a bean and about the same bigness but not altogether so flat the tree is as big as an apple tree with branches not thick yet spreading off the boughs are gross the leaves broad and round and in substance pretty thick this fruit is soft and spongy when ripe and so full of juice that in biting it the juice will run out on both sides of ones mouths it is very pleasant and gratefully rough on the tongue and is accounted a very wholesome fruit this grows both in the east and west indies where i have seen and eaten of it  the jenipah or jenipapah is a sort of fruit of the calabash or gourdkind it is about the bigness of a duckegg and somewhat of an oval shape and is of a gray color the shell is not altogether so thick nor hard as a calabash it is full of whitish pulp mixed with small flat seeds and both pulp and seeds must be taken into the mouth where sucking out the pulp you spit out seeds it is of a sharp and pleasing taste and is very innocent the tree that bears it is much like an ash straitbodied and of a good height clean from limbs till near the top where there branches forth a small head the rind is of a pale gray and so is the fruit we used of this tree to make helves or handles for axes for which it is very proper in the bay of campeachy where i have seen of them and no where else but here  beside these here are many sorts of fruits which i have not met with any where but here as arisahs mericasahs petangos etc arisahs are an excellent fruit not much bigger than a large cherry shaped like a catherinepear being small at the stemb and swelling bigger toward the end they are of a greenish color and have small seeds as big as mustardseeds they are somewhat tart yet pleasant and very wholesome and may be eaten by sick people  mericasahs are an excellent fruit of which there are two sorts one growing on a small tree or shrub which is counted the best the other growing on a kind of shrub like a vine which they plant about arbours to make a shade having many broad leaves the fruit is as big as a small orange round and green when they are ripe they are soft and fit to eat full of white pulp mixed thick with little black seeds and there is no separating one from the other till they are in your mouth when you suck in the white pulp and spit out the stones they are tart pleasant and very wholesome  petangos are a small red fruit that grow also on small trees and are as big as cherries but not so globular having one flat side and also   or   small protulerant ridges it is a very pleasant tart fruit and has a pretty large flattish stone in the middle  petumbos are a yellow fruit growing on a shrub like a vine bigger than cherries with a pretty large stone these are sweet but rough in the mouth  mungaroos are a fruit as big as cherries red on one side and white on the other side they are said to be full of small seeds which are commonly swallowed in eating them  muckishaws are said to be a fruit as big as crabapples growing on large trees they have also small seeds in the middle and are well tasted  ingwas are a fruit like the locustfruit   inches long and one broad they grow on high trees  otee is a fruit as big as a large coconut it has a husk on the outside and a large stone within and is a accounted a very fine fruit  musterandeovas are a round fruit as big as large hazelnuts covered with thin brittle shells of a blackish color they have a small stone in the middle enclosed within a black pulpy substance which is of a pleasant taste the outside shell is chewed with the fruit and spit out with the stone when the pulp is sucked from them the tree that bears this fruit is tall large and very hard wood i have not seen any of these five last named fruits but had them thus described to me by an irish inhabitant of bahia though as to this last i am apt to believe i may have both seen and eaten of them in achin in sumatra  palmberries called here dendees grow plentifully about bahia the largest are as big as wallnuts they grow in bunches on the top of the body of the tree among the roots of the branches or leaves as all fruits of the palm kind do these are the same kind of berries or nuts as those they make the palmoyl with on the coast of guinea where they abound and i was told that they make oil with them here also they sometimes roast and eat them but when i had one roasted to prove it i did not like it  physicknuts as our seamen call them are called here pineon and agnus castus is called here carrepat these both grow here so do mendibees a fruit like physicknuts they scorch them in a pan over the fire before they eat them  here are also great plenty of cabbagetrees and other fruits which i did not get information about and which i had not the opportunity of seeing because this was not the season it being our spring and consequently their autumn when their best fruits were gone though some were left however i saw abundance of wild berries in the woods and field but i could not learn their names or nature  they have withal good plenty of ground fruit as callavances pineapples pumkins watermelons muskmelons cucumbers and roots as yams potatos cassavas etc garden herbs also good store as cabbages turnips onions leeks and abundance of other salading and for the pot drugs of several sorts viz sassafras snakeroot etc beside the woods i mentioned for dying and other uses as fustick speckledwood etc  i brought home with me from hence a good number of plants dried between the leaves of books of some of the choicest of which that are not spoiled i may give a specimen at the end of the book  here are said to be great plenty and variety of wildfowl viz yemmas maccaws which are called here jackoos and are a larger sort of parrots and scarcer parrots parakites flamingos carrioncrows chatteringcrows cockrecoes billbirds finely painted corresoes doves pigeons jenetees clockinghens crabcatchers galdens currecoos moscovy ducks common ducks widgeons teal curlews men of war birds boobys noddys pelicans etc  the yemma is bigger than a swan greyfeathered with a long thick sharppointed bill  the carrioncrow and chatteringcrows are called here mackeraws and are like those i described in the west indies  vol ii part ii p    the bill of the chatteringcrow is black and the upperbill is round bending downwards like a hawksbill rising up in a ridge almost semicircular and very sharp both at the ridge or convexity and at the point or extremity the lowerbill is flat and shuts even with it i was told by a portegueze here that their negrowenches make lovepotions with these birds and the portuguese care not to let them have any of these birds to keep them from that superstition as i found one afternoon when i was in the fields with a padre and another who shot two of them and hid them as they said for that reason they are not good food but their bills are reckoned a good antidote against poison  the billbirds are so called by the english from their monstrous bills which are as big as their bodies i saw none of these birds here but saw several of the breasts flayed off and dried for the beauty of them the feathers were curiously colored with red yellow and orangecolour  the curresos called here mackeraws are such as are in the bay of campeachy vol   part   p     turtledoves are in great plenty here and two sorts of wild pigeons the one sort blackish the other a light gray the blackish or dark gray are the bigger being as large as our woodquests or woodpigeons in england both sorts are very good meat and are in such plenty from may till september that a man may shoot   or  0 dozen in several shots at one standing in a close misty morning when they come to seed on berries that grow in the woods  the jenetee is a bird as big as a lark with blackish feathers and yellow legs and feet it is accounted very wholesome food  clockinghens are much like the crabcatchers which i have described  vol ii part   p  0 but the legs are not altogether so long they keep always in swampy wet places though their claws are like landfowls claws they make a noise or cluck like our broodhens or dunghilhens when they have chickens and for that reason they are called by the english clocking hens there are many of them in the bay of campeachy though i omitted to speak of them there and elsewhere in the west indies there are both here and there four sorts of these longlegd fowls near akin to each other as so many subspecies of the same kind viz crab catchers clockinghens galdens which three are in shape and color like herons in england but less the galden the biggest of the three the crabcatcher the smallest and a fourth sort which are black but shaped like the other having long legs and short tails these are about the bigness of crabcatchers and feed as they do  currecoos are water fowls as big as pretty large chickens of a bluish color with short legs and tail they feed also in swampy ground and are very good meat i have not seen of them elsewhere  the wildducks here are said to be of two sorts the muscovy and the commonducks in the wet season here are abundance of them but in the dry time but few wigeon and teal also are said to be in great plenty here in the wet season  to the southward of bahia there are also ostridges in great plenty though it is said they are not so large as those of africa they are found chiefly in the southern parts of brasil especially among the large savanahs near the river of plate and from thence further south toward the streights of magellan  as for tame fowl at bahia the chief beside their ducks are dunghilfowls os which they have two sorts one sort much of the size of our cocks and hens the other very large and the feathers of these last are a long time coming forth so that you see them very naked when half grown but when they are full grown and well feathered they appear very large fowls as indeed they are neither do they want for price for they are sold at bahia sor half a crown or three shillings apiece just as they are brought first to market out of the country when they are so lean as to be scarce fit to eat  the land animals here are horses black cattle sheep goats rabbits hogs leopards tigers foxes monkeys pecary a sort of wild hogs called here pica armadillo alligaters guanos called quittee lizards serpents toads frogs and a sort of amphibious creatures called by the portuguese cuchoras de agua in english waterdogs  the leopards and tigers of this country are said to be large and very fierce but here on the coast they are either destroyed or driven back toward the heart of the country and therefore are seldom found but in the borders and outplantations where they oftentimes do mischief here are three or four sorts of monkeys of different sizes and colors one sort is very large and another sort is very small these last are ugly in shape and feature and have a strong scent of musk  here are several sorts of serpents many of them vastly great and most of them very venomous as the rattlesnake for one and for venom a small green snake is bad enough no bigger than the stemb of a tobaccopipe and about    inches long very common here  they have here also the amphisbaena or twoheaded snake of a gray color mixed with blackish stripes whose bite is reckoned to be incurable it is said to be blind though it has two small specks in each head like eyes but whether it sees or not i cannot tell they say it lives like a mole mostly under ground and that when it is found above ground it is easily killed because it moves but slowly neither is its sight if it has any so good as to discern any one that comes near to kill as few of these creatures fly at a man or hurt him but when he comes in their way it is about    inches long and about the bigness of the inner joint of a mans middle finger being of one and the same bigness from one end to the other with a head at each end as they said for i cannot vouch it for one i had was cut short at one end and both alike in shape and bigness and it is said to move with either head foremost indifferently whence it is called by the portugueze cobra de dos cabesas the snake with two heads  the small black snake is a very venomous creature  there is also a gray snake with red and brown spots all over its back it is as big as a mans arm and about   foot long and is said to be venomous i saw one of these  here are two sorts of very large snakes or serpents one of em a landsnake the other a watersnake the landsnake is of a gray color and about    or  0 foot long not very venomous but ravenous i was promised the sight of one of their skins but wanted opportunity  the watersnake is said to be near  0 foot long these live wholly in the water either in large rivers or great lakes and prey upon any creature that comes within their reach be it man or beast they draw their prey to them with their tails for when they see any thing on the banks of the river or lake where they lurk they swing about their tails  0 or    foot over the bank and whatever stands within their sweep is snatched with great violence into the river and drowned by them nay it is reported very credibly that if they see only a shade of any animal at all on the water they will flourish their tails to bring in the man or beast whose shade they see and are oftentimes too successful in it wherefore men that have business near any place where these watermonsters are suspected to lurk are always provided with a gun which they often fire and that scares them away or keeps them quiet they are said to have great heads and strong teeth about   inches long i was told by an irish man who lived here that his wives father was very near being taken by one of them about the time of my first arrival here when his father was with him up in the country for the beast flourisht his tail for him but came not nigh enough by a yard or two however it scared him sufficiently  the amphibious creatures here which i said are called by the portuguese cuchoras de agua or waterdogs are said to be as big as small mastives and are all hairy and shaggy from head to tail they have   short legs a pretty long head and short tail and are of a blackish color they live in fresh waterponds and oftentimes come ashore and sun themselves but retire to the water if assaulted they are eaten and said to be good food several of these creatures which i have now spoken of i have not seen but informed my self about them while i was here at bahia from sober and sensible persons among the inhabitants among whom i met with some that could speak english  in the sea upon this coast there is great store and diversity of fish viz jewfish for which there is a great market at bahia in lent tarpoms mullets groopers snooks garfish called here goolions gorasses barramas coquindas cavallies cuchoras or dogfish congereeles herrings as i was told the serrew the olio de boy i write and spell them just as they were named to me whales etc  here is also shellfish though in less plenty about bahia than on other parts of the coast viz lobsters crawfish shrimps crabs oysters of the common sort conchs wilks cockles muscles perriwinkles etc here are three sorts of seaturtle viz hawksbill loggerhead and green but none of them are in any esteem neither spaniards nor portuguese loving them nay they have a great antipathy against them and would much rather eat a porpose though our english count the green turtle very extraordinary food the reason that is commonly given in the west indies for the spaniards not caring to eat of them is the fear they have lest being usually foulbodied and many of them poxd lying as they do so promiscuously with their negrines and other sheslaves they should break out loathsomely like lepers which this sort of food it is said does much incline men to do searching the body and driving out any such gross humors for which cause many of our english valetudinarians have gone from jamaica though there they have also turtle to the i caimanes at the layingtime to live wholly upon turtle that then abound there purposely to have their bodies scoured by this food and their distempers driven out and have been said to have found many of them good success in it but this by the way the hawksbillturtle on this coast of brazil is most sought after of any for its shell which by report of those i have conversed with at bahia is the clearest and bestclouded tortoiseshell in the world i had some of it shown me which was indeed as good as i ever saw they get a pretty deal of it in some parts on this coast but it is very dear  besides this port of bahia de todos los santos there are two more principal ports on brazil where european ships trade viz pernambuc and ria janeira and i was told that there go as many ships to each of these places as to bahia and two men of war to each place for their convoys of the other ports in this country none is of greater note than that of st pauls where they gather much gold but the inhabitants are said to be a sort of banditti or loose people that live under no government but their gold brings them all sorts of commodities that they need as cloths arms ammunition etc the town is said to be large and strong  chap iii the as stay and

month during which time the vice roy of goa came hither from thence in a great ship said to be richly laden with all sorts of india goods but she did not break bulk here being bound home for lisbon only the viceroy intended to refresh his men of whom he had lost many and most of the rest were very sickly having been   months in their voyage hither and so to take in water and depart for europe in company with the other portuguese ships thither bound who had orders to be ready to sail by the twentieth of may he desired me to carry a letter for him directed to his successor the new viceroy of goa which i did sending it thither afterward by captain hammond whom i found near the cape of good hope the refreshing my men and taking in water was the main also of my business here beside the having the better opportunity to compose the disorders among my crew which as i have before related were grown to so great a height that they could not without great difficulty be appeased however finding opportunity during my stay in this place to allay in some measure the ferment that had been raised among my men i now set my self to provide for the carrying on of my voyage with more heart than before and put all hands to work in order to it as fast as the backwardness of my men would permit who showed continually their unwillingness to proceed farther besides their heads were generally filled with strange notions of southerly winds that were now setting in and there had been already some flurries of them which as they surmizd would hinder any farther attempts of going on to the southward so long as they should last  the winds begin to shift here in april and september and the seasons of the year the dry and the wet alter with them in april the southerly winds make their entrance on this coast bringing in the wet season with violent tornados thunder and lightning and much rain in september the other coasting trade at east north east comes in and clears the sky bringing fair weather this as to the change of wind is what i have observed vol ii part   p    but as to the change of weather accompanying it so exactly here at bahia this is a particular exception to what i have experienced in all other places of south latitudes that i have been in between the tropicks or those i have heard of for there the dry seasons sets in in april and the wet about october or november sooner or later as i have said that they are in south latitudes the reverse of the seasons or weather in the same months in n latitudes vol ii part   p    whereas on this coast of brazil the wet season comes in in april at the same time that it does in n latitudes and the dry as i have said here in september the rains here not lasting so far in the year as in other places for in september the weather is usually so fair that in the latter part of that month they begin to cut their sugarcanes here as i was told for i enquired particularly about the seasons though this as to the season of cutting of canes which i was now assured to be in september agrees not very well with what i was formerly told vol ii part   p    that in brazil they cut the canes in july and so as to what is said a little lower in the same page that in managing their canes they are not confined to the seasons this ought to have been expressed only of planting them for they never cut them but in the dry season  but to return to the southerly winds which came in as i expected they would while i was here these daunted my ships company very much though i had told them they were to look for them but they being ignorant as to what i told them farther that these were only coastingwinds sweeping the shore to about  0 or  0 leagues in breadth from it and imagining that they had blown so all the ea over between america and africa and being confirmed in this their opinion by the portuguese pilots of the european ships with whom several of my officers conversed much and who were themselves as ignorant that these were only coasting tradewinds themselves going away before them in their return homewards till they cross the line and so having no experience of the breadth of them being thus possessed with a conceit that we could not sail from hence till september this made them still the more remiss in their duties and very listless to the getting things in a readiness for our departure however i was the more diligent my self to have the ship scrubd and to send my watercasks ashore to get them trimmed my beer being now out i went also to the governor to get my water filled sor here being but one wateringplace and the water running low now at the end of the dry season it was always so crowded with the european ships boats who were preparing to be gone that my men could seldom come nigh it till the governor very kindly sent an officer to clear the waterplace for my men and to stay there till my watescasks were all full whom i satisfied sor his pains here i also got aboard   or  0 tun of ballast and made my boatswain fit the rigging that was amiss and i enquired also of my particular officers whose business it was whether they wanted any stores especially pitch and tar for that here i would supply my self before i proceeded any farther but they say they had enough though it did not afterward prove so  i commonly went ashore every day either upon business or to recreate my self in the fields which were very pleasant and the more for a shower of rain now and then that ushers in the wet season several sorts of good fruits were also still remaining especially oranges which were in such plenty that i and all my company stocked our selves for our voyage with them and they did us a great kindness and we took in also a good quantity of rum and sugar but for fowls they being here lean and dear i was glad i had stockt my self at st jago but by the little care my officers took for fresh provisions one might conclude they did not think of going much farther besides i had like to have been imbroiled with the clergy here of the inquisition as i suppose and so my voyage might have been hindered what was said to them of me by some of my company that went ashore i know not but i was assured by a merchant there that if they got me into their clutches and it seems when i was last ashore they had narrowly watched me the governor himself could not release me besides i might either be murdered in the streets as he sent me word or poisoned if i came ashore any more and therefore he advised me to stay aboard indeed i had now no further business ashore but to take leave of the governor and therefore took his advice  our stay here was till the   d of april i would have gone before if i could sooner have fitted my self but was now earnest to be gone because this harbor lies open to the s and s s w which are raging winds here and now was the season for them we had had two or three touches of them and one pretty severe and the ships ride there so near each other that if a cable should fail or an anchor start you are instantly aboard of one ship or other and i was more afraid of being disabled here in harbor by these blustering winds than discouraged by them as my people were from prosecuting the voyage for at present i even wished for a brisk southerly wind as soon as i should be once well out of the harbor to set me the sooner into the true general tradewind  the tide of flood being spent and having a fine landbreez on the   d in the morning i went away from the anchoringplace before twas light and then lay by till daylight that we might see the better how to go out of the harbor i had a pilot belonging to mr cock who went out with me to whom i gave three dollars but i found i could as well have gone out my self by the soundings i made at coming in the wind was e by n and fair weather by  0 a clock i was got past all danger and then sent away my pilot at    cape salvadore bore n distant   leagues and we had the winds between the e by n and s e a considerable time so that we kept along near the shore commonly in sight of it the southerly blasts had now left us again for they come at first in short flurries and shift to other points for  0 or    days sometimes before they are quite set in and we had uncertain winds between sea and landbreezes and the coastingtrade which was its self unsettled  the easterlywinds at present made me doubt i should not weather a great shoal which lies in lat between    degrees and    degrees s and runs a great way into the sea directly from the land easterly indeed the weather was fair and continued so a good while so that i might the better avoid any danger from it and if the wind came to the southward i knew i could stretch off to sea so that i jogged on courageously the   th of april we saw a small brigantine under the shore plying to the southward we also saw many men of warbirds and boobies and abundance of albicorefish having still fair weather small gales and some calms i had the opportunity of trying the current which i found to set sometimes northerly and sometimes southerly and therefore knew i was still within the verge of the tides being now in the lat of the abrohlo shoals which i expected to meet with i sounded and had water lessening from  0 to    and so to    fathom but then it rose again to          etc all coral rocks whilst we were on this shoal which we crosst toward the further part of it from land where it lay deep and so was not dangerous we caught a great many fish with hook and line and by evening amplitude we had   degrees    min east variation this was the   th of april we were then in lat    degrees    min s and east longitude from cape salvadore    min on the   th being then in lat    degrees    min s we had small gales from the w n w to the w s w often shifting the  0th we had the winds from w to s s e squals and rain and we saw some dolphins and other fish about us we were now out of sight of land and had been so   or   days but the winds now hanging in the south was an apparent sign that we were still too nigh the shore to receive the true general easttrade as the easterly winds we had before showed that we were too far off the land to have the benefit of the coasting southtrade and the faintness of both these winds and their often shifting from the s s w to the s e with squalls rain and small gales were a confirmation of our being between the verge of the s coastingtrade and that of the true trade which is here regularly s e  the third of may being in lat  0 degrees 00 min and merid distance west from cape salvadore     miles the variation was   degrees 00 min we saw no fowl but shearwaters as our seamen call them being a small black fowl that sweep the water as they fly and are much in the seas that lie without either of the tropicks they are not eaten we caught   small sharks each   foot   inches long and they were very good food for us the next day we caught   more sharks of the same size and we eat them also esteeming them as good fish boiled and presst and then stewed with vinegar and pepper  we had nothing of remark from the  d of may to the  0th only now and then seeing a small whale spouting up the water we had the wind easterly and we ran with it to the southward running in this time from the lat of  0 degrees 00 m to    degrees   min s and having then   d   m e long from c salvadore the variation increasing upon us at present notwithstanding we went east we had all along a great difference between the morning and evening amplitudes usually a degree or two and sometimes more we were now in the true trade and therefore made good way to the southward to get without the verge of the general trade wind into a westerly winds way that might carry us toward the cape of good hope by the   th of may being in lat    degrees  0 min we began to meet with westerly winds which freshned on us and did not leave us till a little before we made the cape sometimes it blew so hard that it put us under a forecourse especially in the night but in the daytime we had commonly our main topsail rist we met with nothing of moment only we past by a dead whale and saw millions as i may say of seafowls about the carcass and as far round about it as we could see some feeding and the rest flying about or sitting on the water waiting to take their turns we first discovered the whale by the fowls for indeed i did never see so many fowls at once in my life before their numbers being inconceivably great they were of diverse sorts in bigness shape and color some were almost as big as geese of a gray color with white breasts and with such bills wings and tails some were pintado birds as big as ducks and speckled black and white some were shearwaters some petrels and there were several sorts of large fowls we saw of these birds especially the pintadobirds all the sea over from about  00 leagues distant from the coast of brazil to within much the same distance of new holland the pintado is a southern bird and of that temperate zone for i never saw of them much to the norward of  0 degrees s the pintadobird is as big as a duck but appears as it flies about the bigness of a tame pigeon having a short tail but the wings very long as most seafowls have especially such as these that fly far from the shore and seldom come nigh it for their resting is sitting afloat upon the water but they lay i suppose ashore there are three sorts of these birds all of the same make and bigness and are only different in color the first is black all over the second sort are gray with white bellies and breasts the third sort which is the true pintado or paintedbird is curiously spotted white and black their heads and the tips of their wings and tails are black for about an inch and their wings are also edged quite round with such a small black list only within the black on the tip of their wings there is a white spot seeming as they fly for then their spots are best seen as big as a halfcrown all this is on the outside of the tails and wings and as there is a white spot in the black tip of the wings so there is in the middle of the wings which is white a black spot but this toward the back of the bird turns gradually to a dark gray the back its self from the head to the tip of the tail and the edge of the wings next to the back are all overspotted with fine small round white and black spots as big as a silver twopence and as close as they can stick one by another the belly thighs sides and inner part of the wings are of a light gray these birds of all these sorts fly many together never high but almost sweeping the water we shot one a while after on the water in a calm and a waterspaniel we had with us brought it in i have given a picture of it see birds fig   but it was so damaged that the picture depictions of birds f   this very much resembles the guarauna described and figured by piso p     f   the pintado bird p    does not show it to advantage and its spots are best seen when the feathers are spread as it flies  the petrel is a bird not much unlike a swallow but smaller and with a shorter tail it is all over black except a white spot on the rump they fly sweeping like swallows and very near the water they are not so often seen in fair weather being foulweather birds as our seamen call them and presaging a storm when they come about a ship who for that reason dont love to see them in a storm they will hover close under the ships stern in the wake of the ship as it is called or the smoothness which the ships passing has made on the sea and there as they fly gently then they pat the water alternately with their feet as if they walked upon it though still upon the wing and from hence the seamen give them the name of petrels in allusion to st peters walking upon the lake of gennesareth  we also saw many bunches of seaweeds in the lat of       and by judgment near the meridian of the island tristian daconha and then we had about   d  0 min east variation which was now again decreasing as we ran to the eastward all near the meridian of ascension where we found little or no variation but from thence as we ran farther to the east our variation increased westerly  two days before i made the cape of g hope my variation was   degrees    min west i was then in    degrees    min east longit from c salvador being in lat    degrees  0 min this was the first of june the second of june i saw a large black fowl with a whitish flat bill fly by us and took great notice of it because in the east india waggoner or pilotbook there is mention made of large fowls as big as ravens with white flat bills and black feathers that fly not above  0 leagues from the cape and are looked on as a sign of ones being near it my reckoning made me then think my self above  0 leagues from the cape according to the longitude which the cape has in the common seacharts so that i was in some doubt whether these were the right fowls spoken of in the waggoner or whether those fowls might not fly farther off shore than is there mentioned or whether as it proved i might not be nearer the cape than i reckoned my self to be for i found soon after that i was not then above    or  0 leagues at most from the cape whether the fault were in the charts laying down the cape too much to the east from brazil or were rather in our reckoning i could not tell but our reckonings are liable to such uncertainties from steerage log currents half minuteglasses and sometimes want of care as in so long a run cause often a difference of many leagues in the whole account  most of my men that kept journals imputed it to the halfminuteglasses and indeed we had not a good glass in the ship beside the halfwatch or two hourglasses as for our halfminuteglasses we tried them all at several times and we found those that we had used from brazil as much too short as others we had used before were too long which might well make great errors in those several reckonings a ship ought therefore to have its glasses very exact and besides an extraordinary care ought to be used in heaving the log for fear of giving too much strayline in a moderate gale and also to stop quickly in a brisk gale for when a ship runs     or  0 knots half a knot or a knot is soon run out and not heeded but to prevent danger when a man thinks himself near land the best way is to look out betimes and lie by in the night for a commander may err easily himself beside the errors of those under him though never so carefully eyed  another thing that stumbled me here was the variation which at this time by the last amplitude i had i found to be but  degrees    min w whereas the variation at the cape from which i found my self not  0 leagues distant was then computed and truly about    degrees or more and yet a while after this when i was got  0 leagues to the eastward of the cape i found the variation but  0 degrees  0 min w whereas it should have been rather more than at the cape these things i confess did puzzle me neither was i fully satisfied as to the exactness of the taking the variation at sea for in a great sea which we often meet with the compass will traverse with the motion of the ship besides the ship may and will deviate somewhat in steering even by the best helmsmen and then when you come to take an azimuth there is often some difference between him that looks at the compass and the man that takes the altitude height of the sun and a small error in each if the error of both should be one way will make it wide of any great exactness but what was most shocking to me i found that the variation did not always increase or decrease in proportion to the degrees of longitude east or west as i had a notion they might do to a certain number of degrees of variation east or west at such or such particular meridians but finding in this voyage that the difference of variation did not bear a regular proportion to the difference of longitude i was much pleased to see it thus observed in a scheme shown me after my return home wherein are represented the several variations in the atlantic sea on both sides the equator and there the line of no variation in that sea is not a meridian line but goes very oblique as do those also which show the increase of variation on each side of it in that draught there is so large an advance made as well toward the accounting for those seemingly irregular increases and decreases of variation toward the s e coast of america as toward the fixing a general scheme or system of the variation every where which would be of such great use in navigation that i cannot but hope that the ingenious author capt halley who to his profound skill in all theories of these kinds has added and is adding continually personal experiments will ever long oblige the world with a fuller discovery of the course of the variation which has hitherto been a secret for my part i profess my self unqualified for offering at any thing of a general scheme but since matter of fact and whatever increases the history of the variation may be of use toward the settling or confirming the theory of it i shall here once for all insert a table of all the variations i observed beyond the equator in this voyage both in going out and returning back and what errors there may be in it i shall leave to be corrected by the observations of others  a table of variations d m d m d m s lat longit variat      mar              w from st jago      e                    apr          00  0 e from c salvador in brazil   0

jogd on to the eastward to make the cape on the third of june we saw a sail to leeward of us showing english colors i bore away to speak with her and found her to be the antelope of london commanded by captain hammond and bound for the bay of bengal in the service of the neweastindia company there were many passengers aboard going to settle there under sir edward littleton who was going chief thither i went aboard and was known by sir edward and mr hedges and kindly received and treated by them and the commander who had been afraid of us before though i had sent one of my officers aboard they had been in at the cape and came from thence the day before having stockt themselves with refreshments they told me that they were by reckoning  0 miles to the west of the cape while i was aboard them a fine small westerly wind sprang up therefore i shortened my stay with them because i did not design to go in to the cape when i took leave i was presented with half a mutton    cabbages    pumkins   pound of butter   couple of stockfish and a quantity of parsnips sending them some oatmeal which they wanted  from my first setting out from england i did not design to touch at the cape and that was one reason why i touched at brazil that there i might refresh my men and prepare them for a long run to new holland we had not yet seen the land but about   in the afternoon we saw the capeland bearing east at above    leagues distance and captain hammond being also bound to double the cape we jogd on together this afternoon and the next day and had several fair sights of it which may be seen  table iii no        to proceed having still a westerly wind i jogd on in company with the antelope till sunday june the  th at   in the afternoon when we parted they steering away for the east indies and i keeping an e s e course the better to make my way for new holland for though new holland lies northeasterly from the cape yet all ships bound toward that coast or the streights of sundy ought to keep for a while in the same parallel or in a lat between    and  0 at least a little to the s of the east that they may continue in a variable winds way and not venture too soon to stand so far to the north as to be within the verge of the tradewind which will put them by their easterly course the wind increased upon us but we had yet sight of the antelope and of the land too till tuesday the  th of june and then we saw also by us an inumerable company of fowls of diverse sorts so that we looked about to see if there were not another dead whale but saw none  the night before the sun set in a black cloud which appeared just like land and the clouds above it were gilded of a dark red color and on the tuesday as the sun drew near the horizon the clouds were gilded very prettily to the eye though at the same time my mind dreaded the consequences of it when the sun was now not above   degrees high it entered into a dark smoakycoloured cloud that lay parallel with the horizon from whence presently seemed to issue many dusky blackish beams the sky was at this time covered with small hard clouds as we call such as lie scattering about not likely to rain very thick one by another and such of them as lay next to the bank of clouds at the horizon were of a pure gold color to   or   degrees high above the bank from these to about  0 degrees high they were redder and very bright above them they were of a darker color still to about  0 or  0 degrees high where the clouds began to be of their common color i took the more particular notice of all this because i have generally observed such colored clouds to appear before an approaching storm and this being winter here and the time for bad weather i expected and provided for a violent blast of wind by riffing our topsails and giving a strict charge to my officers to hand them or take them in if the wind should grow stronger the wind was now at w n w a very brisk gale about    a clock at night we had a pale whitish glare in the n w which was another sign and intimated the storm to be near at hand and the wind increasing upon it we presently handed our topsails furled the mainsail and went away only with our foresail before   in the morning it came on very fierce and we kept right before wind and sea the wind still increasing but the ship was very governable and steered incomparably well at   in the morning we settled our foreyard lowering it   or   foot and we ran very swiftly especially when the squals of rain or hail from a black cloud came over head for then it blew excessive hard these though they did not last long yet came very thick and fast one after another the sea also ran very high but we running so violently before wind and sea we shipped little or no water though a little washed into our upper deckports and with it a scuttle or cuttlefish was cast upon the carriage of a gun  the wind blew extraordinary hard all wednesday the  th of june but abated of its fierceness before night yet it continued a brisk gale till about the   th and still a moderate one till the   th day by which time we had run about  00 leagues for the most part of which time the wind was in some point of the west viz from the w n w to the s by w it blew hardest when at w or between the w and s w but after it veered more southerly the foul weather broke up this i observed at other times also in these seas that when the storms at west veered to the southward they grew less and that when the wind came to the e of the s we had still smaller gales calms and fair weather as for the westerly winds on that side the cape we like them never the worse for being violent for they drive us the faster to the eastward and are therefore the only winds coveted by those who sail toward such parts of the east indies as lie south of the equator as timor java and sumatra and by the ships bound for china or any other that are to pass through the streights of sundy those ships having once past the cape keep commonly pretty far southerly on purpose to meet with these west winds which in the winter season of these climates they soon meet with for then the winds are generally westerly at the cape and especially to the southward of it but in their summer months they get to the southward of  0 degrees usually ever they meet with the westerly winds i was not at this time in a higher lat than    degrees  0 min and oftentimes was more northerly altering my latitude often as winds and weather required for in such long runs it is best to shape ones course according to the winds and if in steering to the east we should be obliged to bear a little to the n or s of it it is no great matter for it is but sailing   or   points from the wind when it is either northerly or southerly and this not only eases the ship from straining but shortens the way more than if a ship was kept close on a wind as some men are fond of doing  the   th of june we were in lat    degrees    min s and long from the cape    degrees    min e and had small gales and calms the winds were at n e by e and continued in some part of the e till the   th day when it having been some time at n n e it came about at n and then to the w of the n and continued in the westboard between the n n w and s s w till the  th of july in which time we ran     miles then the winds came about again to the east we reckoning our selves to be in a meridian   00 l east of that of the cape and having fair weather sounded but had no ground  we met with little of remark in this voyage besides being accompanied with fowls all the way especially pintadobirds and seeing now and then a whale but as we drew nigher the coast of newholland we saw frequently   or   whales together when we were about  0 leagues from the land we began to see seaweeds all of one sort and as we drew nigher the shore we saw them more frequently at about  0 leagues distance we began to see some scutlebones floating on the water and drawing still nigher the land we saw greater quantities of them  july the   th being in lat    degrees    min s and longitude e from the c of g hope    degrees    min we saw a large garfish leap   times by us which seemed to be as big as a porpose it was now very fair weather and the sea was full of a sort of very small grass or moss which as it floated in the water seemed to have been some spawn of fish and there was among it some small fry the next day the sea was full of small round things like pearl some as big as white peace they were very clear and transparent and upon crushing any of them a drop of water would come forth the skin that contained the water was so thin that it was but just deseernable some weeds swam by us so that we did not doubt but we should quickly see land on the   th also some weeds swam by us and the birds that had flown along with us all the way almost from brazil now left us except only   or   shearwaters on the   th we saw many weeds swim by us and some whales blowing on the   th we had dark cloudy weather with much thunder lightning and violent rains in the morning but in the evening it grew fair we saw this day a scutlebone swim by us and some of our young men a seal as it should seem by their description of its head i saw also some bonetas and some skipjacks a fish about   inches long broad and sizable not much unlike a roach which our seamen call so from their leaping about  the  0th of july being still nearer the land we saw abundance of scutlebones and seaweed more tokens that we were not far from it and saw also a sort of fowls the like of which we had not seen in the whole voyage all the other fowls having now left us these were as big as lapwings of a gray color black about their eyes with red sharp bills long wings their tails long and forked like swallows and they flew flapping their wings like lapwings in the afternoon we met with a ripling like a tide or current or the water of some shole or overfal but were past it before we could sound the birds last mentioned and this were further signs of land in the evening we had fair weather and a small gale at west at   a clock we sounded again but had no ground  we kept on still to the eastward with an easy sail looking out sharp for by the many signs we had i did expect that we were near the land at    a clock in the night i sounded and had    fathom course sand and small white shells i presently clapped on a wind and stood to the south with the wind at w because i thought we were to the south of a shoal called the abrohles an appellative name for shoals as it seems to me which in a draught i had of that coast is laid down in    degrees    min lat stretching about   leagues into the sea i was the day before in    degrees    min by reckoning and afterward steering e by s purposely to avoid it i thought i must have been to the south of it but sounding again at one a clock in the morning aug the first we had but    fathom coralrocks and so found the shoal was to the south of us we presently tackt again and stood to the north and then soon deepned our water for at two in the morning we had    fathom coral still at three we had    coralground at   we had  0 fathom course sand with some coral at depictions of new holland australia table iv new holland no   n holland from topmast head in ye lat    d  0 m s at these bearings did  0 l no   n holland the same coast

fallen in to the north of the shole and that it was laid down wrong in my seachart for i found it lie in about    degrees lat and by our run in the next day i found that the outwardedge of it which i sounded on lies    leagues off shore when it was day we steered in e n e with a fine brisk gale but did not see the land till   in the morning when we saw it from our topmasthead and were distant from it about  0 leagues having then  0 fathomwater and clean sand about   hours after we saw it on our quarter deck being by judgment about   leagues off and we had then  0 fathom clean sand as we ran in this day and the next we took several sights of it at different bearings and distances from which it appeared as you see in  table iv no           and here i would note once for all that the latitudes marked in the draughts or sights here given are not the latitude of the land but of the ship when the sight was taken this morning august the first as we were standing in we saw several large seafowls like our gannets on the coast of england flying three or four together and a sort of white seamews but black about the eyes and with forked tails we strove to run in near the shore to seek for a harbor to refresh us after our tedious voyage having made one continued stretch from brazil hither of about     degrees designing from hence also to begin the discovery i had a mind to make on n holland and n guinea the land was low and appeared even and as we drew nearer to it it made as you see in table iv no       with some red and some white clifts these last in lat     0 s where you will find    fathom within four miles of the shore  about the lat of    degrees s we saw an opening and ran in hoping to find a harbor there but when we came to its mouth which was about two leagues wide we saw rocks and foul ground within and therefore stood out again there we had  0 fathomwater within two mile of the shore the land every where appeared pretty low flat and even but with steep cliffs to the sea and when we came near it there were no trees shrubs or grass to be seen the soundings in the lat of    degrees s from about   or   leagues off till you come within a league of the shore are generally about  0 fathom differing but little seldom above three or four fathom but the lead brings up very different sorts of sand some course some fine and of several colors as yellow white gray brown bluish and reddish  when i saw there was no harbor here nor good anchoring i stood off to sea again in the evening of the second of august fearing a storm on a leeshore in a place where there was no shelter and desiring at least to have searoom for the clouds began to grow thick in the westernboard and the wind was already there and began to blow fresh almost upon the shore which at this place lies along n n w and s s e by nine a clock at night we had got a pretty good offin but the wind still increasing i took in my main topsail being able to carry no more sail than two courses and the mizen at two in the morning aug   it blew very hard and the sea was much raised so that i furled all my sails but my mainsail though the wind blew so hard we had yet pretty clear weather till noon but then the whole sky was blackned with thick clouds and we had some rain which would last a quarter of an hour at a time and then it would blow very fierce while the squals of rain were over our heads but as soon as they were gone the wind was by much abated the stress of the storm being over we sounded several times but had no ground till   a clock aug the  th in the evening and then had  0 fathomwater coralground at ten we had    fathom fine sand at twelve we had    fathom fine sand of a pale bluish color it was now pretty moderate weather yet i made no sail till morning but then the wind veering about to the s w i made sail and stood to the north and at    a clock the next day aug   we saw land again at about  0 leagues distance this noon we were in lat    degrees  0 min and in the afternoon our cook died an old man who had been sick a great while being infirm before we came out of england  the  th of august in the morning we saw an opening in the land and we ran in to it and anchored in seven and a half fathomwater   miles from the shore clean sand it was somewhat difficult getting in here by reason of many shoals we met with but i sent my boat sounding before me the mouth of this sound which i called sharks bay lies in about    degrees s lat and our reckoning made its longitude from the c of good hope to be about    degrees which is less by     leagues than is usually laid down in our common draughts if our reckoning was right and our glasses did not deceive us as soon as i came to anchor in this bay of which i have given a plan table iv no   i sent my boat ashore to seek for fresh water but in the evening my men returned having found none the next morning i went ashore my self carrying pickaxes and shovels with me to dig for water and axes to cut wood we tried in several places for water but finding none after several trials nor in several miles compass we left any farther search for it and spending the rest of the day in cutting wood we went aboard at night  the land is of an indifferent height so that it may be seen   or  0 leagues off it appears at a distance very even but as you come nigher you find there are many gentle risings though none steep nor high it is all a steep shore against the open sea but in this bay or sound we were now in the land is low by the seaside rising gradually in within the land the mould is sand by the seaside producing a large sort of sampier which bears a white flower farther in the mould is reddish a sort of sand producing some grass plants and shrubs the grass grows in great tufts as big as a bushel here and there a tuft being intermixed with much heath much of the kind we have growing on our commons in england of trees or shrubs here are diverse sorts but none above ten foot high their bodies about   foot about and   or   foot high before you come to the branches which are bushy and composed of small twigs there spreading abroad though thick set and full of leaves which were mostly long and narrow the color of the leaves was on one side whitish and on the other green and the bark of the trees was generally of the same color with the leaves of a pale green some of these trees were sweetscented and reddish within the bark like sassafras but redder most of the trees and shrubs had at this time either blossoms or berries on them the blossoms of the different sort of trees were of several colors as red white yellow etc but mostly blue and these generally smelt very sweet and fragrant as did some also of the rest there were also beside some plants herbs and tall flowers some very small flowers growing on the ground that were sweet and beautiful and for the most part unlike any i had seen elsewhere  there were but few landfowls we saw none but eagles of the larger sorts of birds but   or   sorts of small birds the biggest sort of these were not bigger than larks some no bigger than wrens all depictions of birds f   the head and greatest part of ye neck of this bird is red and therein differs from the avosetta of italy f   a noddy of n holland p     f   a common noddy p  f   the bill and legs of this bird are of a bright r singing with great variety of fine shrill notes and we saw some of their nests with young ones in them the waterfowls are ducks which had young ones now this being the beginning of the spring in these parts curlews galdens crabcatchers cormorants gulls pelicans and some waterfowl such as i have not seen any where besides i have given the pictures of   several birds on this coast see birds fig          the landanimals that we saw here were only a sort of raccoons different from those of the west indies chiefly as to their legs for these have very short fore legs but go jumping upon them as the others do and like them are very good meat and a sort of guanos of the same shape and size with other guanos described vol i p    but differing from them in three remarkable particulars for these had a larger and uglier head and had no tail and at the rump instead of the tail there they had a stump of a tail which appeared like another head but not really such being without mouth or eyes yet this creature seemed by this means to have a head at each end and which may be reckoned a fourth difference the legs also seemed all four of them to be forelegs being all alike in shape and length and seeming by the joints and bending to be made as if they were to go indifferently either head or tail foremost they were speckled black and yellow like toads and had scales or knobs on their backs like those of crocodiles plated on to the skin or stuck into it as part of the skin they are very slow in motion and when a man comes nigh them they will stand still and hiss not endeavoring to get away their livers are also spotted black and yellow and the body when opened has a very unsavory smell i did never see such ugly creatures any where but here the guanos i have observed to be very good meat and i have often eaten of them with pleasure but though i have eaten of snakes crocodiles and allegators and many creatures that look frightfully enough and there are but few i should have been afraid to eat of if pressed by hunger yet i think my stomach would scarce have served to venture upon these n holland guanos both the looks and the smell of them being so offensive  the seafish that we saw here for here was no river land or pond of fresh water to be seen are chiefly sharks there are abundance of them in this particular sound that i therefore gave it the name of sharks bay here are also skates thornbacks and other fish of the ray kind one sort especially like the seadevil and garfish bonetas etc of shellfish we got here muscles periwinkles limpits oysters both of the pearlkind and also eatingoysters as well the common sort as long oysters beside cockles etc the shore was lined thick with many other sorts of very strange and beautiful shells for variety of color and shape most finely spotted with red black or yellow etc such as i have not seen any where but at this place i brought away a great many of them but lost all except a very few and those not of the best  there are also some green turtle weighing about  00 lb of these we caught   which the water ebbing had left behind a ledge of rock which they could not creep over these served all my company   days and they were indifferent sweet meat of the sharks we caught a great many which our men eat very savourily among them we caught one which was    foot long the space between its   eyes was  0 inches and    inches from one corner of his mouth to the other its maw was like a leather sack very thick and so tough that a sharp knife could scarce cut it in which we found the head and boans of a hippopotomus the hairy lips of which were still sound and not putrified and the jaw was also firm out of which we plucked a great many teeth   of them   inches long and as big as a mans thumb small at one end and a little crooked the rest not above half so long the maw was full of jelly which stank extremely however i saved for a while the teeth and the sharks jaw the flesh of it was divided among my men and they took care that no waste should be made of it  twas the  th of august when we came into sharksbay in which we anchored at three several places and stayed at the first of them on the w side of the bay till the   th during which time we searched about as i said for fresh water digging wells but to no purpose however we cut good store of firewood at this first anchoringplace and my company were all here very well refreshed with raccoons turtle shark and other fish and some fowls so that we were now all much brisker than when we came in hither yet still i was for standing farther into the bay partly because i had a mind to increase my stock of fresh water which was began to be low and partly for the sake of discovering this part of the coast i was invited to go further by seeing from this anchoringplace all open before me which therefore i designed to search before i left the bay so on the   th about noon i steered farther in with an easy sail because we had but shallow water we kept therefore good looking out for fear of sholes sometimes shortning sometimes deepning the water about   in the afternoon we saw the land a head that makes the s of the bay and before night we had again sholdings from that shore and therefore shortened sail and stood off and on all night under   topsails continually sounding having never more then  0 fathom and seldom less than   the water deepned and sholdned so very gently that in heaving the lead   or   times we should scarce have a foot difference when we came into   fathom either way we presently went about from this s part of the bay we could not see the land from whence we came in the afternoon and this land we found to be an island of   or   leagues long as is seen in the plain table iv no   but it appearing barren i did not strive to go nearer it and the rather because the winds would not permit us to do it without much trouble and at the openings the water was generally shole i therefore made no farther attempts in this s w and s part of the bay but steered away to the eastward to see if there was any land that way for as yet we had seen none there on the   th in the morning we passed by the n point of that land and were confirmed in the persuasion of its being an island by seeing an opening to the east of it as we had done on the w having fair weather a small gale and smooth water we stood further on in the bay to see what land was on the e of it our soundings at first were   fathom which held so a great while but at length it decreased to   then we saw the land right ahead that in the plan makes the e of the bay we could not come near it with the ship having but shole water and it being dangerous lying there and the land extraordinarily low very unlikely to have fresh water though it had a few trees on it seemingly mangroves and much of it probably covered at high water i stood out again that afternoon deepning the water and before night anchored in   fathom clean white sand about the middle of the bay the next day we got up our anchor and that afternoon came to an anchor once more near two islands and a shole of corral rocks that face the bay here i scrubbd my ship and finding it very improbable i should get any thing further here i made the best of my way out to sea again sounding all the way but finding by the shallowness of the water that there was no going out to sea to the east of the two islands that face the bay nor between them i returned to the west entrance going out by the same way i came in at only on the east instead of the west side of the small shole to be seen in the plan in which channel we had  0    and    fathomwater still deepning upon us till we were out at sea the day before we came out i sent a boat ashore to the most northerly of the two islands which is the least of them catching many small fish in the mean while with hook and line the boats crew returning told me that the ifle produces nothing but a sort of green short hard prickly grass affording neither wood nor fresh water and that a sea broak between the two islands a sign that the water was shallow they saw a large turtle and many skates and thornbacks but caught none  it was august the   th when i sailed out of this bay or sound the mouth of which lies as i said in    degrees   min designing to coast along to the n e till i might commodiously put in at some other part of n holland in passing out we saw three waterserpents swimming about in the sea of a yellow color spotted with dark brown spots they were each about four foot long and about the bigness of a mans wrist and were the first i saw on this coast which abounds with several sorts of them we had the winds at our first coming out at n and the land lying northeasterly we plied off and on getting forward but little till the next day when the wind coming at s s w and s we began to coast it along the shore to the northward keeping at   or   leagues off shore and sounding often we had between  0 and    fathomwater brown sand with some white shells this   th of august we were in lat    degrees    min on the   th day at noon we were in    degrees    min the wind coming at e by n we could not keep the shore aboard but were forced to go farther off and lost sight of the land then sounding we had no ground with  0 fathomline however the wind shortly after came about again to the southward and then we jogged on again to the northward and saw many small dolphins and whales and abundance of scuttleshells swimming on the sea and some watersnakes every day the   th we saw the land again and took a sight of it see table iv no    the   th in the afternoon being   or   leagues off shore i saw a shole point stretching from the land into the sea a league or more the sea broke high on it by which i saw plainly there was a shole there i stood farther off and coasted along shore to about   or   leagues distance and at    a clock at night we sounded and had but  0 fathom hard sand by this i found i was upon another shole and so presently steered off w half an hour and had then  0 fathom at one in the morning of the   th day we had    fathom by two we could find no ground and then i ventured to steer along shore again due n which is two points wide of the coast that lies here n n e for fear of another shole i would not be too far off from the land being desirous to search into it wherever i should find an opening or any convenience of searching about for water etc when we were off the sholepoint i mentioned where we had but  0 fathomwater we had in the night abundance of whales about the ship some a head others a stern and some on each side blowing and making a very dismal noise but when we came out again into deeper water they left us indeed the noise that they made by blowing and dashing of the sea with their tails making it all of a breach and foam was very dreadful to us like the breach of the waves in very sholewater or among rocks the shole these whales were upon had depth of water sufficient no less than twenty fathom as i said and it lies in lat    degrees    min the shore was generally bold all along we had met with no shole at sea since the abrohloshole when we first fell on the n holland coast in the lat of    till yesterday in the afternoon and this night this morning also when we expected by the draught we had with us to have been    leagues off shore we were but   so that either our draughts were faulty which yet hitherto and afterward we found true enough as to the lying of the coast or else here was a tide unknown to us that deceived us though we had found very little of any tide on this coast hitherto as to our winds in the coasting thus far we had been within the verge of the general trade though interrupted by the storm i mentioned from the lat of    when we first fell in with the coast and by that time we were in the lat of    we had usually the regular tradewind which is here s s e when we were at any distance srom shore but we had often sea and landbreezes especially when near shore and when in sharks bay and had a particular n west wind or storm that set us in thither on this   th of august we coasted with a brisk gale of the true tradewind at s s e very sair and clear vveather but haling off in the evening to sea were next morning out of sight of land and the land now trending away n easterly and we being to the norward of it and the wind also shrinking from the s s e to the e s e that is from the true tradewind to the seabreeze as the land now lay we could not get in with the land again yet awhile so as to see it though we trimmed sharp and kept close on a wind we were this   th day in lat   degrees    min the  0th we were in lat    degrees    min and kept close on a wind to get sight of the land again but could not yet see it we had very fair weather and though we were so far from the land as to be out of sight of it yet we had the sea and landbreezes in the night we had the landbreeze at s s e a small gentle gale which in the morning about sunrising would shift about gradually and withal increasing in strength till about noon we should have it at e s e which is the true seabreeze here then it would blow a brisk gale so that we could scarce carry our top sails double rift and it would continue thus till   in the afternoon when it would decrease again the weather was fair all the while not a cloud to be seen but very hazy especially nigh the horizon we sounded several times this  0th day and at first had no ground but had afterward from    to    fathom course brown sand mixed with small brown and white stones with dints besides in the tallow  the   st day also we had small landbreezes in the night and seabreezes in the day and as we saw some seasnakes every day so this day we saw a great many of two different sorts or shapes one sort was yellow and about the bigness of a mans wrist about   foot long having a flat tail about   fingers broad the other sort was much smaller and shorter round and spotted black and yellow this day we sounded several times and had    fathom sand we did not make the land till noon and then saw it first from our topmasthead it bore se by e about   leagues distance and it appeared like a cape or head of land the seabreeze this day was not so strong as the day before and it veered out more so that we had a fair wind to run in with to the shore and at sunset anchored in  0 fathom clean sand about   leagues from the bluff point which was not a cape as it appeared at a great distance but the eastermost end of an island about   or   leagues in length and one in breadth there were   or   rocky islands about a i cague from us between us and the bluff point and we saw many other islands both to the east and west of it as far as we could see either way from our topmast head and all within them to the s there was nothing but islands of a pretty height that may be seen   or   leagues off by what we saw of them they must have been a range of islands of about  0 leagues in length stretching from e n e to vv s vv and for ought i know as far as to those of sharksbay and to a considerable breadth also for we could see   or  0 leagues in among them toward the continent or main land of n holland if there be any such thing hereabouts and by the great tides i met with awhile afterward more to the n east i had a strong suspicion that here might be a kind of archipelago of islands and a passage possibly to the s of n holland and n guinea into the great s sea eastward which i had thoughts also of attempting in my return from n guinea had circumstances permitted and told my officers so but i would not attempt it at this time because we wanted water and could not depend upon finding it there this place is in the lat of  0 degrees    min but in the draught that i had of this coast which was tasmans it was laid down in    degrees  0 min and the shore is laid down as all along joining in one body or continent with some openings appearing like rivers and not like islands as really they are see several sights of it table iv no      0 this place therefore lies more northerly by  0 min than is laid down in mr tasmans draught and beside its being made a firm continued land only with some openings like the mouths of rivers i sound the soundings also different from what the pricked line of his course shows them and generally shallower than he makes them which inclines me to think that he came not so near the shore as his line shows and so had deeper soundings and could not so well distinguish the islands his meridian or difference of longitude from sharksbay agrees well enough with my account which is     leagues though we differ in lat and to confirm my conjecture that the line of his course is made too near the shore at least not far to the east of this place the water is there so shallow that he could not come there so nigh  but to proceed in the night we had a small landbreeze and in the morning i weighed anchor designing to run in among the islands for they had large channels between them of a league wide at least and some   or   leagues wide i sent in my boat before to sound and if they sound sholewater to return again but if they sound water enough to go ashore on one of the islands and stay till the ship came in where they might in the mean time search for water so we followed after with the ship sounding as we went in and had  0 fathom till within   leagues of the bluffhead and then we had shole water and very uncertain soundings yet we ran in still with an easy sail sounding and looking out well for this was dangerous work when we came abreast of the bluffhead and about   mile from it we had but   fathom then we edged away from it but had no more water and running in a little further we had but   fathoms so we anchored immediately and yet when we had veered out a third of a cable we had   fathom water again so uncertain was the water my boat came immediately aboard and told me that the island was very rocky and dry and they had little hopes of finding water there i sent them to sound and bad them if they found a channel of   or  0 fathom water to keep on and we would follow with the ship we were now about   leagues within the outer small rocky islands but still could see nothing but islands within us some   or   leagues long others not above a mile round the large islands were pretty high but all appeared dry and mostly rocky and barren the rocks looked of a rusty yellow color and therefore i dispaird of getting water on any of them but was in some hopes of finding a channel to run in beyond all these islands could i have spent time here and either get to the main of new holland or find out some other islands that might afford us water and other refreshments besides that among so many islands we might have found some sort of rich mineral or ambergreese it being a good latitude for both these but we had not sailed above a league farther before our water grew sholer again and then we anchored in   fathom hard sand  we were now on the inner side of the island on whose outside is the bluffpoint we rode a league from the island and i presently went ashore and carried shovels to dig for water but found none there grow here   or   sorts of shrubs one just like rosemary and therefore i called this rosemary island it grew in great plenty here but had no smell some of the other shrubs had blue and yellow flowers and we found   sorts of grain like beans the one grew on bushes the other on a sort of a creeping vine that runs along on the ground having very thick broad leaves and the blossom like a bean blossom but much larger and of a deep red color looking very beautiful we saw here some cormorants gulls crabcatchers etc a few small land birds and a sort of white parrots which flew a great many together we found some shellfish viz limpits perriwinkles and abundance of small oysters growing on the rocks which were very sweet in the sea we saw some green turtle a pretty many sharks and abundance of watersnakes of several sorts and sizes the stones were all of rusty color and ponderous  we saw a smoke on an island   or   leagues off and here also the bushes had been burned but we found no other sign of inhabitants t was probable that on the island where the smoke was there were inhabitants and fresh water for them in the evening i went aboard and consulted with my officers whether it was best to send thither or to search among any other of these islands with my boat or else go from hence and coast along shore with the ship till we could find some better place than this was to ride in where we had shole water and lay exposed to winds and tides they all agreed to go from hence so i gave orders to weigh in the morning as soon as it should be light and to get out with the landbreeze  accordingly august the   d at   in the morning we ran out having a pretty fresh landbreeze at s s e by   a clock we were got out and very seasonably for before   the seabreeze came on us very strong and increasing we took in our topsails and stood off under   courses and a mizan this being as much sail as we could carry the sky was clear there being not one cloud to be seen but the horizon appeared very hazy and the sun at setting the night before and this morning at rising appeared very red the wind continued very strong till twelve then it began to abate i have seldom met with a stronger breeze these strong seabreezes lasted thus in their turns   or   days they sprung up with the sun rise by   a clock they were very strong and so continued till noon when they began to abate and by sunset there was little wind or a calm till the landbreezes came which we should certainly have in the morning about   or   a clock the landbreezes were between the s s w and s s e the seabreezes between the e n e and n n e in the night while calm we fished with hook and line and caught good store of fish viz snappers breams old wives and dogfish when these last came we seldom caught any others for if they did not drive away the other fish yet they would be sure to keep them from taking our hooks for they would depictions of fish plate   f  a fish taken on the coast of new holland f   a cuttle taken near n holland f  a flying fish taken in ye open sea f   the monk fish page     f   a remora taken sticking to sharks ba first have them themselves biting very greedily we caught also a monkfish of which i brought home the picture see fish fig i  on the   th of august we still coasted along shore that we might the better see any opening kept sounding and had about  0 fathom clean sand the   th day being about   leagues off shore the water began gradually to sholden from  0 to    fathom i was edging in a little toward the land thinking to have anchored but presently after the water decreased almost at once till we had but   fathom i durst therefore adventure no farther but steered out the same way that we came in and in a short time had  0 fathom being then about   leagues and a half from the shore and even soundings i steered away e n e coasting along as the land lies this day the seabreezes began to be very moderate again and we made the best of our way along shore only in the night edging off a little for fear of sholes ever since we left sharksbay we had had fair clear weather and so for a great while still  the   th day we had  0 fathom water all night yet we could not see land till   in the afternoon from our topmasthead by   we could just discern land from our quarter deck we had then    fathom the wind was at n and we steered e by n which is but one point in on the land yet we decreased our water very fast for at   we had but   fathom the next cast but   which frighted us and we then tackt instantly and stood off but in a short time the wind coming at n w and w n w we tackt again and steered n n e and then deepned our water again and had all night from    to  0 fathom  the   th day we had between  0 and  0 fathom we saw no land this day but saw a great many snakes and some whales we saw also some boobies and noddybirds and in the night caught one of these last it was of another shape and color than any i had seen before it had a small long bill as all of them have flat feet like ducks feet its tail forked like a swallow but longer and broader and the fork deeper than that of the swallow with very long wings the top or crown of the head of this noddy was coalblack having also small black streaks round about and close to the eyes and round these streaks on each side a pretty broad white circle the breast belly and under part of the wings of this noddy were white and the back and upper part of its wings of a saint black or smoke color see a picture of this and of the common one birds fig     noddies are seen in most places between the tropicks as well in the east indies and on the coast of brazil as in the west indies they rest a shore a nights and therefore we never see them far at sea not above  0 or  0 leagues unless driven off in a storm when they come about a ship they commonly perch in the night and will sit still till they are taken by the seamen they build on cliffs against the sea or rocks as i have said vol i p     the  0th day being in lat    degrees    min we made the land again and saw many great smoaks near the shore and having fair weather and moderate breezes i steered in toward it at   in the afternoon i anchored in   fathom water clear sand about   leagues and a half from the shore i presently sent my boat to sound nearer in and they found  0 fathom about a mile farther in and from thence still farther in the water decreased gradually to       and at   mile distance to   fathom this evening we saw an eclipse of the moon but it was abating before the moon appeared to us for the horizon was very hazy so that we could not see the moon till she had been half an hour above the horizon and at two hours    min after sunset by the reckoning of our glasses the eclipse was quite gone which was not of many digits the moons center was then    degrees  0 min high  the   st of august betimes in the morning i went ashore with  0 or    men to search for water we went armed with muskets and cutlasses for our defense expecting to see people there and carried also shovels and pickaxes to dig wells when we came near the shore we saw   tall black naked men on the sandy bay ahead of us but as we rowed in they went away when we were landed i sent the boat with two men in her to ly a little from the shore at an anchor to prevent being seized while the rest of us went after the   black men who were now got on the top of a small hill about a quarter of a mile from us with   or   men more in their company they seeing us coming ran away when we came on the top of the hill where they first stood we saw a plain savannah about half a mile from us farther in from the sea there were several things like haycocks standing in the savannah which at a distance we thought were houses looking just like the hottentots houses at the cap of g hope but we found them to be s many rocks we searched about these for water but could find none nor an houses nor people for they were a then we returned again to the place where we landed and there we dug for water  while we were at work there came   or  0 of the natives to a small hill a little way from us and stood there menacing and threatening of us and making a great noise at last one of them came toward us and the rest followed at a distance i went out to meet him and came within  0 yards of him making to him all the signs of peace and friendship i could but then he ran away neither would they any of them stay for us to come nigh them for we tried two or three times at last i took two men with me and went in the afternoon along by the seaside purposely to catch one of them if i could of whom i might learn where they got their fresh water there were  0 or    of the natives a little way off who seeing us three going away from the rest of our men followed us at a distance i thought they would follow us but there being for a while a sandbank between us and them that they could not then see us we made a halt and hid our selves in a bending of the sandbank they knew we must be thereabouts and being   or   times our number thought to seize us so they dispersed themselves some going to the seashore and others beating about the sandhills we knew by what rencounter we had had with them in the morning that we could easily outrun them so a nimble young man that was with me seeing some of them near ran toward them and they for some time ran away besore him but he soon overtaking them they faced about and fought him he had a cutlass and they had wooden lances with which being many of them they were too hard for him when he first ran toward them i chased two more that were by the shore but fearing how it might be with my young man i turned back quickly and went up to the top of a sandhill whence i saw him near me closely engaged with them upon their seeing me one of them threw a lance at me that narrowly misst me i discharged my gun to scare them but avoided shooting any of them till finding the young man in great danger from them and my self in some and that though the gun had a little frighted them at first yet they had soon learnt to despise it tossing up their hands and crying pooh pooh pooh and coming on afresh with a great noise i thought it high time to charge again and shoot one of them which i did the rest seeing him fall made a stand again and my young man took the opportunity to disengage himself and come off to me my other man also was with me who had done nothing all this while having come out unarmed and i returned back with my men designing to attempt the natives no farther being very sorry for what had happened already they took up their wounded companion and my young man who had been struck through the cheek by one of their lances was afraid it had been poisoned but i did not think that likely his wound was very painful to him being made with a blunt weapon but he soon recovered of it  among the n hollanders whom we were thus engaged with there was one who by his appearance and carriage as well in the morning as this afternoon seemed to be the chief of them and a kind of prince or captain among them he was a young brisk man not very tall nor so pesonable as some of the rest though more  and courageous he was painted which none of the rest were at all with a circle of white paste or pigment a sort ime as we thought about his eyes and a white streak down his nose from his forehead to the tip of it and his breast and some part of his arms were also made white with the same paint not for beauty or ornament one would think but as some wild indian warriors are said to do he seemed thereby to design the looking more terrible this his painting adding very much to his natural deformity for they all of them of the most unpleasant looks and the worst features of any people that ever i saw though i have seen great variety of savages these n hollanders were probably the same sort of people as those i met with on this coast in my voyage round the world see vol i p     etc for the place i then touched at was not above  0 or  0 leagues to the n e of this and these were much the same blinking creatures here being also abundance of the same kind of fleshflies teizing them and with the same black skins and hair frizled tall and thin etc as those were but we had not the opportunity to see whether these as the former wanted two of their foreteeth  we saw a great many places where they had made fires and where there were commonly   or   boughs stuck up to windward of them for the wind which is the seabreeze in the daytime blows always one way with them and the landbreeze is but small by their fireplaces we should always find great heaps of fishshells of several sorts and it is probable that these poor creatures here lived chiefly on the shellfish as those i before described did on small fish which they caught in wires or holes in the sand at low water these gathered their shellfish on the rocks at low water but had no wires that we saw whereby to get any other sorts of fish as among the former i saw not any heaps of shells as here though i know they also gathered some shellfish the lances also of those were such as these had however they being upon an island with their women and children and all in our power they did not there use them against us as here on the continent where we saw none but some of the men under head who come out purposely to observe us we saw no houses at either place and i believe they have none since the former people on the island had none though they had all their families with them  upon returning to my men i saw that though they had dug   or   foot deep yet found no water so i returned aboard that evening and the next day being september  st i sent my boatswain ashore to dig deeper and sent the sain with him to catch fish while i staid aboard i observed the flowing of the tide which runs very swift here so that our nunbuoy would not bear above the water to be seen it flows here as on that part of n holland i described formerly about   fathom and here the flood runs s e by s till the last quarter then it sets right in toward the shore which lies here s s w and n n e and the ebb runs n w by n when the tides slackned we fished with hook and line as we had already done in several places on this coast on which in this voyage hitherto we had found but little tides but by the height and strength and course of them hereabouts it should seem that if there be such a passage or straight going through eastward to the great south sea as i said one might suspect one would expect to find the mouth of it somewhere between this place and rosemary island which was the part of n holland i come last from  next morning my men came aboard and brought a rundlet of brackish water which they got out of another well that they dug in a place a mile off and about half as far from the shore but this water was not fit to drink however we all concluded that it would serve to boil our oatmeal for burgoo whereby we might save the remains of our other water for drinking till we should get more and accordingly the next day we brought aboard   hogsheads of it but while we were at work about the well we were sadly pestered with the flies which were more troublesome to us than the sun though it shone clear and strong upon us all the while very hot all this while we saw no more of the natives but saw some of the smoaks of some of their fires at   or   miles distance  the land hereabouts was much like that part of new holland that i formerly described vol i p     it is low but seemingly barricadod with a long chain of sandhills to the sea that let us nothing be seen of what is farther within land a high water the tides rising so high as they do the coast shows very low but when it is low water it seems to be of an indifferent height at low watermark the shore is all rocky so that then there is no landing with a boat but at high water a boat may come in over those rocks to the sandy bay which runs all along on this coast the land by the sea for about   or  00 yards is a dry sandy soil bearing only shrubs and bushes of diverse sorts some of these had them at this time of the year yellow flowers or blossoms some blue and some white most of them of a very fragrant smell some had fruit like peasecods in each of which there were just ten small peace i opened many of them and found no more nor less there are also here some of that sort of bean which i saw at rosemaryisland and another sort of small red hard pulse growing in cods also with little black eyes like beans i know not their names but have seen them used often in the east indies for weighing gold and they make the same use of them at guinea as i have heard where the women also make bracelets with them to wear about their arms these grow on bushes but here are also a fruit like beans growing on a creeping sort of shrublike vine there was great plenty of all these sorts of codfruit growing on the sandhills by the seaside some of them green some ripe and some fallen on the ground but i could not perceive that any of them had been gathered by the natives and might not probably be wholesome food  the land farther in that is lower than what borders on the sea was so much as we saw of it very plain and even partly savannahs and partly woodland the savannahs bear a sort of thin course grass the mould is also a courser sand than that by the seaside and in some places it is clay here are a great many rocks in the large savannah we were in which are   or   foot high and round at top like a haycock very remarkable some red and some white the woodland lies farther in still where there were diverse sorts of small trees scarce any thre foot in circumserence their bodies    o    foot high with a head of small knibs or boughs by the sides of the creeks especially nigh the sea there grow a few small black mangrovetrees  there are but few landanimals i saw some lizards and my men saw two or three beasts like hungry wolves lean like so many skeletons being nothing but skin and bones it is probable that it was the foot of one of those beasts that i mentioned as seen by us in n holland vol i p     we saw a rackoon or two and one small speckled snake  the landfowls that we saw here were crows just such as ours in england small hawks and kites a few of each sort but here are plenty of small turtledoves that are plump fat and very good meat here are   or   sorts of smaller birds some as big as larks some less but not many of either sort the seafowl are pelicans boobies noddies curlews seapies etc and but few of these neither  the sea is plentifully stocked with the largest whales that i ever saw but not to compare with the vast ones of the northern seas we saw also a great many green turtle but caught none here being no place to set a turtlenet in here being no channel for them and the tides running so strong we saw some sharks and paracoots and with hooks and lines we caught some rockfish and old wives of shellfish here were sters both of the common kind for eati and of the pearlkind and also w onchs muscles limpits perriwinkles etc and i gathered a few strange shells chiefly a sort not large and thickset all about with rays or spikes growing in rows  and thus having ranged about a considerable time upon this coast without finding any good fresh water or any convenient place to clean the ship as i had hoped for and it being moreover the height of the dry season and my men growing scorbutic for want of refreshments so that i had little encouragement to search further i resolved to leave this coast and accordingly in the beginning of september set sail toward timor  an account of several plants collected in brasil new holland timor and new guinea referring to the figures engraven on the copper plates tab   fig   cottonflower from baya in brasil the flower consists of a great many filaments almost as small as hairs betwixt   and   inches long of a murreycolour on the top of them stand small ashcolored apices the pedicule of the flower is enclosed at the bottom with five narrow stiff leaves about six inches long there is one of this enus in mr rays supplement which agrees exactly with this in every respect only that is twice larger at the least it was sent from surinam by the name of momoo  tab   fig   jasminum brasilianum luteum mali limoniae folio nervoso petalis crassis  tab   fig   crista pavonis brasiliana bardanae foliis the leaves are very tender and like the top leaves of bardana major both as to shape and texture in the figure they are represented too stiff and too much serrated  tab   fig   filix brasiliana osmundae minori serrato folio this fern is of that kind which bears it is seedvessels in lines on the edge of the leaves  tab   fig   rapuntium novae hollandiae flore magno coccineo the perianthium composed of five long pointed parts the form of the seedvessel and the smalness of the seeds together with the irregular shape of the flower and thinness of the leaves argue this plant to be a rapuntium  tab   fig   fucus foliis capillaceis brevissimis vesiculis minimis donatis this elegant fucus is of the erica marina or sargazo kind but has much finer parts than that it was collected on the coast of new holland  depictions of plants tab   plants found in brasil depictions of plants tab   plants found in new holland depictions of plants tab   plants found in new holland   tab   fig   ricinoides novae hollandae anguloso crasso folio this plant is shrubby has thick woolly leaves especially on the under side its fruit is tricoccous hoary on the outside with a calix divided into five parts it comes near ricini fructu parvo frucosa curassavica folio phylli p b pr  tab   fig   solanum spinosum novae hollandiae phylli foliis subrotundis this new solanum bears a bluish flower like the others of the same tribe the leaves are of a whitish color thick and woolly on both sides scarce an inch long and near as broad the thorns are very sharp and thick set of a deep orange color especially toward the points  tab   fig   scabiosa forte novae hollandiae statices foliis subtus argenteis the flower stands on a footstalk four inches long included in a rough calix of a yellowish color the leaves are not above an inch long very narrow like thrift green on the upper and hoary on the under side growing in tufts whether this plant be a scabious thrift or chrysum is hard to judge from the imperfect flower of the dried speeimen  tab   fig   alcea novae hollandiae  augustis utrinque villosis the leaves  and under side of the perianthium of this plant are all woolly the petala are very tender five in number scarce so large as the calix in the middle stands a a columella thick set with thrummy apiculae which argue this plant to belong to the malvaceous kind  tab   fig   of what genus this shrub or tree is is uncertain agreeing with none yet described as far as can be judged by the state it is in it has a very beautiful flower of a red color as far as can be guessed by the dry specimen consisting of ten large petala hoary on both sides especially underneath the middle of the flower is thick set with stamin which are woolly at the bottom the length of the petala each of them crowned with its apex the calix is divided into five round pointed parts the leaves are like those of amelanchier lob green a top and very woolly underneath not running to a point as is common in others but with an indenture at the upper end  tab   fig   dammara ax nova hollandia sanamundae secundae chysii foliis this new genus was first sent from amboyna by mr rumphius by the name of dammara of which he transmitted two kinds one with narrow and long stiff leaves the other with shorter and broader the first of them is mentioned in mr petivers centuria p   0 by the name of arbor hortensis javanorum foliis depictions of plants tab   plants found in new holland and timor visce augustioribus aromaticis sloribus spicatis stamineis lutescentibus mus pet as also in mr rays supplement to his history of plants now in the press this is of the same genus with them agreeing both in flower and fruit though very much differing in leaves the flowers are stamineous and seem to be of an herbaceous color growing among the leaves which are short and almost round very stiff and ribbd on the under side of a dark green above and a pale color underneath thick set on by pairs answering one another crossways so that they cover the stalk the fruit is as big as a peppercorn almost round of a whitish color dry and tough with a hole on the top containing small seeds any one that sees this plant without its seedvessels would take it for an erica or sanamunda the leaves of this plant are of a very aromatic taste  tab   fig   equisetum novae hollandiae frutesceus foliis longissimis it is doubtful whether this be an equisetum or not the texture of the leaves agrees best with that genus of any being articulated one within another at each joint which is only proper to this tribe the longest of them are about nine inches  tab   fig   colutea novae hollandiae sloribus amplis coccineis umbellatim dispositis macula purpurea notatis there being no leaves to this plant it is hard to say what genus it properly belongs to the flowers are very like to the colutea barbae jovis folio flore coccineo breynii of the same scarlet color with a large deep purple spot in the vexillum but much bigger coming all from the same point after the manner of an umbel the rudiment of the pod is very woolly and terminates in a filament near two inches long  tab   fig   conyza novae hollandiae angustis rorismarini foliis this plant is very much branched and seems to be woody the flowers stand on very short pedicules arising from the sinus of the leaves which are exactly like rosemary only less it tastes very bitter now dry  tab   fig   mohoh insulae timor this is a very odd plant agreeing with no described genus the leaf is almost round green on the upper side and whitish underneath with several fibers running from the insertion of the pedicule toward the circumference it is umbilicated as cotyledon aquatica and faba aegyptiae the flowers are white standing on single footstalk of the shape of a stramoniam but divided into four points only as is the
