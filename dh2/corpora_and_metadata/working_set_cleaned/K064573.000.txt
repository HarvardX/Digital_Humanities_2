a fifth discourse on the miracles of our savior  in view of the present controversy between infidels and apostates   ridiculum acri fortius and melius magnas plerumque secat res the second edition  by tho woolston b d sometime fellow of sidneycollege in cambridge  london printed for the author and sold by him next door to the star in aldermanbury and by the booksellers of london and westminster      price one shilling  to the right reverend father in god thomas lord bishop of bangor my lord whatever we poor authors may sometimes pretend to by the dedication of our works to great men it is certain we aim at nothing less than rewards we deserve them or not that this is my design in dedications is so apparent that it is to no purpose to deny or dissemble it  wherefore else have i made choice of some of our learned and wealthy bishops for the patrons of these discourses which i foresaw would be grateful to their nice and critical palates wherefore else have i been so profuse of such compliments on their lordships as i was sure they would take great pleasure in wherefore else my lord do i inscribe this to your right reverend name but that i expect your approbation of it and  some who are envious my lord of my good fortune in episcopal patrons will not believe that i have received so much as one purse of gold for any of my dedications but i would have such malignants to know that the less i have received the more there is behind and i can moreover assure them that their lordships have it in their heads and their hearts too highly to advance me in the world and if their endeavors for my promotion fail not i shall be a very great man  such primitive doctrine my lord as i have revived must in the judgment of our bishops be deserving of their distinguished favors and if they should design for me such a mystical crown of glory as the gentile priests helped some of the fathers of the church to i profess without dissimulation that for all my love to mysteries it will be more than i am ambitious of but if the honor is forced on me it will be my duty to their lordships to sound an allegorical trumpet of their fame that their names which might otherwise be soon forgotten may be everlastingly remembered for their love and good will toward me  but the chief foundation my lord of my merits lies they say in my treatment of the miracles of our savior after the manner you handled a scriptureprophecy of a mans kicking a serpent on the pate for biting him by the heels and if your lordship got a welshbishoprick upon it what may not i expect for my more meritorious works of the same kind the great mr scheme has celebrated your praise for that effort of your wit and i must needs say to your lordships applause that were not your thoughts unhappily shackled with interest and subscriptions an unhappiness you sadly lament you would endeavor to make as pleasant work with the letter of the old as i can do with that of the new testament  i have not here room my lord for a sufficient and deserved encomium on your use and intent of prophecy therefore must be content to say of it in short that it is a most curious piece of what the fathers call engastromuthism or such a singular specimen of a webb spun out of a mans own bowels as one of fewer brains in his head can hardly equal  it was wisely done of your lordship to caution your readers against taking your book for an answer to mr grounds otherwise it had not been impossible but some others as well as the worshipful benchers of the temple might have mistaken the use and intent of it  after i had gone through your beautifullyprinted work i wished my lord for another decoration of it that some annotations out of the fathers had been subjoined to it how would your notions then and theirs about prophecy have stood as a foil to each other how should i then have admired the difference between a rich bishop and a poor father as to wit and sense how should i then have contemplated the usefulness of ecclesiastical wealth in our clergy for the understanding of the inspirations of the poor old prophets  when your lordship is called upon for another edition of your book vouchsafe me the favor of making some marginal remarks on it which shall not be without their good use as you know savoury sauce makes some sort of food go down the better so a little more of that salt which mr scheme has too sparingly sprinkled on your work will give your readers a right relish of it but whether i am indulged this favor or not i shall take another opportunity according to promise elsewhere made of testifying to the world how much i am  my lord the admirer of your use and intent of prophecy thomas woolston october         a fifth discousrse on the miracles of our savior etc according to promise in my last discourse i am in this to take into examination the three miracles of jesuss raising the dead viz of iairuss daughter mat ix mark v luke viii  of the widow of naims son luke vii  and of lazarus john xi  the literal stories of which i shall show to consist of absurdities improbabilities and incredibilities in order to the mystical interpretation of them and because some of our bishops and clergy were a little disgusted at the ludicrous treatment of the letter of some foregoing miracles i will handle these with the more caution being as unwilling as any man of my primitive faith can be to offend weak brethren  whether jesus raised any more from the dead besides the foresaid three persons is uncertain from the evangelical history st augustine quot autem mortuos visibiliter suscitaverat quis novit non enim omnia quae fecit scripta sunt johannes hoc dicit multa alia fecit jesus quae si scripta essent arbitror totum mundum non posse libros capere multi ergo sunt alii sino dubio suscitati sed non frustra tres commemorati in sermon xcviii thinks he raised many others and he founds his opinion on the modest hyperbole of st john who supposes john xxi    the world it self could not contain the books that might be written of jesus and eusebius gallicanus of whose mind entirely i am says non autem vacat a mysterio quod cum plur dominus suscitaverat tres tantum evangelistae eum suscitasse scripserunt in homil  quintae post dominic   tam the reason lies in the mystery why these three and no more than these three miracles of this kind are recorded by the evangelists but since our divines are averse to mysteries on miracles i would gladly know their opinion whether jesus raised any others from the dead or not i have made some search into modern writers for their opinion in this case but cannot find it and unless i knew their opinion it would be lost labor to argue against either side of the question and much more against both sides of it but i can assure our divines that which side of the question soever they should hold the consequence upon the argument would be neither better nor worse than that they must of necessity espouse the mystical and allegorical interpretation of these miracles or grant that jesus literally raised none from the dead at all  but waving that sort of argument for the present against the letter these three miracles are reputed the greatest that jesus wrought and i believe it will be granted on all hands that the restoring a person indisputably dead to life again is a stupendous miracle and that two or three such miracles well circumstanced and credibly reported are enough to conciliate the belief of mankind that the author of them was a divine agent and invested with the power of god or he could not do them but god knows and for the sake of the mystery i am not sorry to say it this is far from being the case of these three miracles before us or of any one them  that these three miracles are not equally great but differ in degree is visible enough to any one that but cursorily reads and compares theirs stories one with another the fathers of the church suscitaverat dominus filiam jairi principis synagogr sed adhuc mediante morte adhuc viante spiritu huc anima claustra tartari nesciente suscitavit and unicum matris filium sed sic ut retineret pheretrum ut anticiparet sepulchrum ut corruptionem suspenderet and praevenret faetorem ut ante mortuo vitam redderet quam tota mortuus jura mortis intraret circa lazarum vero quod geritur totum singular est quem circa  mortis impleta est in pet chrysol sermon lxiii have taken notice of such a difference amongst them the greatest of the three and indeed the inter omnia miracula quae fecit dominus noste jesu christus lazari resurrectio praecipue praedicatur st august in loc johan greatest miracle that jesus is supposed to have wrought is that of lazaruss resurrection which in truth was a most prodigious miracle if his corpse was putrified and stank or if there were no just exceptions to be made to the credibility of the story next to that in magnitude is jesuss raising of the widows son as they were carrying him to his burial and a great miracle it was to bring him to life again if none before or since had been mistaken for dead and carried to their graves alive or if no impostor and his confederates could frame such a seemingly miraculous scene as is that whole story to his own glory the least of the three is that of his raising jairuss daughter which in appearance is so far from a miracle that according to the story itself she was but asleep or by the shrieks of bystanders frighted out of her senses for the present  but however it really might be with these three supposed dead and revived persons the case of none of them was well enough circumstanced to serve the purpose of our divines i am apt to believe with the fathers that jesus actually did raise the dead but then as these miracles are only recorded for the sake of the mystery i affirm that none of them as to the letter will abide the test of a critcal examination nor stand its ground against such exceptions as may be made to them if jesus was to raise any dead bodies to life for a testimony of his divine power and authority he would and should have made choice of other dead persons under other circumstances of death and the history of their resurrection should have been more credibly and carefully transmitted to posterity so as there should have been no room left to make a reasonable doubt of the truth of it but this i say is not the case in the resuscitation of any of these persons as will appear from the following remarks and observations upon them and    observe that the unnatural and preposterous order of time in which these miracles are related justly brings them all under suspicion of fable and forgery the greatest of the three is indisputably that of lazaruss resurrection but since this is only mentioned by st john who wrote his gospel after the other evangelists and above sixty years according to the best computation after our lords ascension here is too much room for cavil and question whether this story be not entirely his invention what could be the reason that matthew mark and luke who all wrote their gospels before john and many years nearer to the death of our savior should omit to record this remarkable and most illustrious miracle of lazarus they could not forget it nor be ignorant of it if the story had been really true and to assign any other reason than ignorance or forgetfulness is hard and impossible to aggrandize the fame of their master for a worker of miracles was the design of all the evangelists especially of the three first who may be presumed to make a report of the greatest if not of all that jesus wrought but that there should come after them an evangelist with an huge and superlatively great miracle and meet with credit for it is against all sense and reason neither is there any story so disorderly told in all history that critics will admit of the belief of the first writer of the life of an hero to be sure makes mention of all the grand occurrences of it and leaves no room for biographers afterward but to enlarge and paraphrase upon what he has written with some other circumstances and additions of less moment if a third or a fourth biographer after him shall presume to add a more illustrious transaction of the heros life it will be rejected as fable and romance though for no other reason than this that the first writer must have been apprisd of it and would have inserted its story if there had been any truth in it and whether st johns story of lazaruss resurrection that miracle of miracles ought not to be subjected to the like criticism upon it christians may consider and infidels will judge  what then was the reason i ask again that the three first evangelists neglected to record this renowned miracle of lazarus and why too may i enquire here did not matthew and mark mention the story of the widow of naims son as they could not but know of it if true more certainly than luke the companion of paul who alone has made a report of it grotius says mirum videri potest historiam hanc tam illustrem a matthae and marco omissam in loc luc it may seem strange that this illustrious miracle of the widows son was omitted by matthew and mark and what is the reason that grotius gives for this strange omission why he tells us sed videtur mihi horum uterque contentus fui uno exemplo redditae vitae in jairi filia ex quo similia alia possunt intelligi in loc luc that these two evangelists were content with one miraculous instance of this kind by which christians might judge of jesus s power in others also and is this reason sufficient true it is they were content with one instance but if they had made a report of two or three more of the same sort no body would have thought their history of christ overcharged with impertinent and tautological repetitions but one instance of a person raised from the dead they were says grotius content with and i will grant one to be sufficient but which then should they as wise and considerate historians have made choice of the greatest or the least miracle the greatest to be sure and that was of lazarus or of the widows son if they knew of either but instead of either of these they tell us the story of jairuss daughter that is nondum perfecta mors est in puella st august in sermon xcviii an imperfect and disputable miracle in comparison of the other two which consequently they knew nothing at all of or they would have preferred the report of them  if matthew the first writer had recorded only the story of lazarus whose resurrection was the greatest miracle and if luke had added that of the widow of naims son and john lastly had remembered us of jairuss daughter which the other evangelists not through ignorance or forgetfulness but studying brevity had omitted then all had been well and no objection had hence lain against the credit of any of these miracles or against the authority of the evangelists but this unnatural and preposterous order of time in which these miracles are recorded the greatest being postponed to the least administers just occasion of suspicion of the truth and credibility of all their stories and it is lucky for christianity that jews and infidels have not hitherto hit upon the absurdity of this preposterous narration or they might have formed a cogent objection against these miracles thus saying   jesus it is manifest raised not the dead at all the only person that christians can reasonably pretend he did raise was jairuss daughter whom matthew writes of and she according to the story was only in a sleep or an extacy when jesus revived her but the galileans who were after a time called christians finding their account in a resurrectionmiracle luke for the former advantage of the cause devised another story of better circumstances in the widow of naims son but this not being so great a miracle as the church still wanted john when no body was alive to contradict and expostulate with him for it trumps up a long story of a thumping miracle in jesuss raising of lazarus who had been not only dead but buried so long that he stank again but to prove the story of this miracle to be false and fabulous we need say no more than that it was last recorded if there had been any truth in it the first evangelist would have remembered us of it  we dont suppose that you christians because of your prejudices will subscribe to this account that we thus give of the rise of these miracles but this is certain that if these three miracles had not been reported of jesus but of mahomet in the same disorder of time by three different historians you would presently have scented the forgery and imposture you would justly have affirmed that the three stories were apparently three fables and falsehoods and that the three historians visibly strove to outstretch each other that the first was sparing and modest in his romance and the second being sensible of the insufficiency of the formers tale devises a miracle of a bigger size which still not proving sufficient to the end proposed the third writer rather than his prophets honor should sink for want of a resurrectionmiracle forges a story of a monstrously huge one against which it is and always will be objection enough that it was not related by the first historian so would you christians argue against these three miracles in another impostors case and there is not a judicious critic in the universe that would not approve of the argument and applaud the force of it though you will not endure the thoughts of it in the case of your jesus  but to come nearer home to you supposing john who was then above a hundred and in his dotage had not reported this miracle of lazarus but that clement joining it with his in epist prima ad corinth cap xxv incredible story of the resurrection of a phaenix or ignatius or polycarp or the author of the apostolical constitutions had related it would not your christian critics have been at work to explode it there is not an ancient extraevangelical tradition of any note about jesus that some or other of your critics have not boggled at but such a story as this of lazarus would have been received by none i question whether mr whiston would not have rejected the constitutions upon such a story in them or if his fancy for some other things in them had overcome his reason against this yet bishop smallbroke who has written against the canonicalness of the constitutions with his judicious animadversions upon this story would absolutely have overthrown their authority and what would he have said here not only that the miracle smells rankly of forgery and fraud or the evangelists especicially matthew had never forgotten to record it but he would have reminded us of intrinsic notes  hereafter to be mentioned of absurdity and incredibility that would for ever have cashiered the belief of it and whether we infidels ought not to take the same liberty to criticize on johns gospel which you do on your apostolical fathers who wrote before him let the impartial and unprejudiced judge if in justice we ought to take it we are sure we could give two or three notable reasons but that we will not now put christians out of temper with them why john may be suspected of a mistake or fraud in this miracle rather than any other christian writer of the first or second century  to such an unhappy objection arising from the unnatural and preposterous order of time in which they are recorded are these three miracles before us obnoxious and i am thinking how ministers of the letter will be able to get over it as for my self who am for the mystical interpretation of these miracles i have a solid and substantial answer at hand to the foresaid objection an answer that curiously accounts for the order of time in which these miracles are related but my answer will not please our divines nor stand them in any stead therefore they must look up another good one of their own that will comport with the letter or the said objection improved with another presently against lazaruss resurrection will be too hard not for christianity it self but for their ministry  grotius being aware of the foresaid objection has given us such a quaeri solet cur hanc tam nobilem historiam priores evangelii scriptores non attigerint mihi hoc succurrit cum illi scriberent vixisse resuscitatum lazarum and periculum ei fuisse a judaeis si quod illi acciderat palam vulgaretur nam etiam mox narratur c xii  0 ob hoc ipsum structas ei insidias quare visum illis hoc ad tempus subticeri posse cum alia exempla resuscitatorum suppeterent at mortuo lazaro cum jam nemini periculum ex rei narratione fieri posset additum hoc a johanne in hac quasi praetermissorum collectione in loc johan solution of it as then occurred to his thoughts dr whitby not being satisfied with grotiuss solution has given us the last of the three evange lists writing but fifteen years after our lords ascension might think it needless to mention a miracle concerning a person living so near jerusalem where there was so great a fame thereof and so many living witnesses st john writing his gospel say the ancients above sixty years after our lords ascension when by the deaths of the person and most of the witnesses that were present at his resurrection the memory and fame of it might be much impaired had great reason to perpetuate the memory of it by this large rehearsal of it in loc johan another but how weak and insufficient both their solutions are i will not spare time to consider till some writer shall appear in defense of the sufficiency and strength of one or other of them and so i pass to a    second observation by way of objection to the letter of these miracles and that is by enquiring what became of these three persons after their resurrection how long did they live afterward and of what use and advantage were their restored ives to the church or to mankind the evangelical and ecclesiastical history is entirely silent as to these questions which is enough to make us suspect their stories to be merely romantic or parabolical and that there were no such persons raised from the dead or we must have heard somewhat of their station and conversation in the world afterward it is true that ephiphanius quin and illud inter traditiones reperimus triginta tum annos natum fuisse lazaru cum a mortuis excitatus est atque idem ille postea triginta aliis annis vixit in haeres lxvi sect    says what he found among traditions that lazarus lived thirty years after his resurrection but how did he spend his time all that while was it to the honor of jesus to the service of the church and progagation of the gospel of that we know nothing tho in reason and gratitude to jesus his benefactor it ought to have been so spent and if it had been so employed history surely would have informed us of it according to the opinion of grotius in a citation above lazarus for the rest of his restored life absconded and skulld about the country for fear of the jews who lay in wait for him which is a suggestion not only dishonorable to jesus as if the same power that raised him from the dead could not protect him against his enemies but reproachful to lazarus himself who should have chosen to suffer death again rather than not bear an open testimony to jesus the author of his resurrection however it was we hear no more of lazarus than that he lived thirty years afterward which tradition without other memorials of his life brings the miracle more under suspicion of fable than if he had died soon after it and of jairuss daughter and of the widow of naims son which is astonishing we read nothing at all does not this silence in history about them make their miracles questionable and but like gulliverian tales of persons and things that out of the romance never had any being  jesus did but matt xviii   call a little child and set him in the midst of his disciples and that act was remembered in the piety and zeal in nicephor callist eccl hist l ii c    of ignatius who made a renowned bishop but the favor and blessing conferred on these three raised persons was exceedingly greater and one might have expected that lazarus and the widows son would have been eminent ministers of the gospel but instead of that their lives afterward were passed in obscurity or what is as bad ecclesiastical history has neglected a report of them what can any one hereupon think less than that the favor of the miracles was lost on undeserving persons which i abhor the thoughts of or that their stories are but parables which i rather incline to  ministers of the letter may here say that the ecclesiastical history of the apostolical age is very scanty and that many memorials of other persons and transactions are lost and buried in oblivion which unhappy fate has attended the afterlives and actions of these raised persons or undoubtedly we should have had a famous record of them this is not impossible though in the wisdom of providence it is hardly probable but that some more remembrance must have been left of one or other if not of all the three persons in as much as such a remembrance of them would nowadays have no less gained a belief of the miracles than this historical silence tends to the discredit of them  it is somewhat strange that we hear no more of the afterfame and life of any of the diseased persons whom jesus miraculously cured excepting of the woman healed of an issue of blood who though she spent all she had even all her living upon physicians yet out of the remains of it erected says in eccl hist l vii c    eusebius at caesarea philippi two most costly statues of brass to the memory of jesus and of herself and of the miracle wrought by him which dr whitby in loc matthaei as if he was tainted with infidelity endeavors to make an idle tale of but excepting i say this story of this woman we hear nothing of any other healed person which is matter of some speculation but that the persons raised from the dead should not at all be mentioned in history for their labors and lives afterward to the honor of jesus is absolutely unaccountable whether such a profound silence in history about them be not shocking of the credit of the miracles let our divines consider i am of opinion that if jesus really raised these persons from the dead this and no other reason in the providence of god can be given for the silence of ecclesiastical history about them afterward than to make deadletterd stories of their miracles in order to turn our heads entirely to the consideration of their mystical signification without which the letter for the argument before us is deserving of no regard nor credit but    by way of objection to the letter of these three miracles let us consider the condition of the persons raised from the dead and whether they were at all proper persons for jesus to work such a miracle upon in testimony of his divine power if they were improper persons according to the letter it is not credible that he who was the wisdom of god would raise them or if he did it was because they were the properest to make mystical emblems of their stories  that jesus ought to have raised all that died wherever he came during the time of his ministry none i presume can hold two or three instances of his almighty and miraculous power of this kind will be allowed to be sufficient but then they must be wisely and judiciously made choice of out of a vast number of persons that must needs die in that time where then was his wisdom and prudence to choose these three persons above others to that honor why were all of them or indeed any one of them preferred to other persons of a different age and condition in the world nay if the letter of their stories is only to be regarded were not all these three persons almost the improperest and most unfit of any for jesus to exercise that power on  jairuss daughter was an insignificant girl of twelve years old and there could be no reason for raising her but to wipe sorrow from the hearts and tears from the eyes of her parents who ought to have been better philosophers than immoderately to grieve for her and was here a good reason for jesus to interpose with his almighty powe no certainly a lecture of patience and resignation in this case had been enough and tho jesus could raise her from the dead yet for as much as that favor was to be conferred but on a few and his miracles ought to be useful as well as conspicuous she should have been passed by as an improper object of his power in comparison of many others presently to be named if therefore a better reason than what is discernible in the letter is not to be fetched from the mystery i cannot suppose that jesus the wisdom of god would raise this girl but that the modern belief of her resuscitation exclusive of the mystical signification is as shall be by and by argued altogether groundless  the widow of naims son too was but a  youth and whether any thing older than the girl above is doubtful but his life certainly was of no more importance to the world after than before his resurrection and why was he then one of the three to be raised from the dead why had he this honor done him before others of greater age worth and use to mankind some will say for the comfort of his sorrowful mother and is this reason sufficient a discourse on the pleasures of abrahams bosom where she would ever long meet her son had been enough to cheer her heart if therefore the fathers dont help me to a solid mystical reason why the son and only son of a widow was to be raised by jesus as they were carrying him to his burial i will not believe he would raise this dead boy rather than many others for the manifestation of his power but that the story of his resurrection as shall soon be reasonably proved was all sham and cheat  lazarus indeed was jesuss friend whom he loved and as i will not question but jesuss affection was wisely and deservedly placed on him so here to appearance was a better reason for the raising of him than of either of the other two but even this reason supposing jesus was to raise but three persons is not sufficient against the cases of many others that may be put for the manifestation of his power for the illustration of his wisdom and goodness and for the conversion of unbelievers consequently if this story of lazarus be not parabolical the litteral fact is disputable and obnoxious to such exceptions presently to be observed against it as will not be easily got over  jesus raised the dead and wrought other miracles say our divines often not only to manifest his own power and glory but his love to mankind and his inclination to do them good for which reason his miracles are useful and beneficial as well as stupendous and supernatural acts on purpose to conciliate mens affections as well as their faith to him on this topic our divines are copious and rhetorical when they write on jesuss miracles as if no more useful and wonderful works could be done than what he did and i do agree with them that what reason bespeaks the miracles of a pretended author of religion ought to be both as useful and great as well as could be but such were not jesuss miracles according to letter and least of all his acts of raising the dead for if we consider the persons raised by him we shall find he could hardly have exerted his power on any of less importance to the world both before and after their resurrection a young girl indeed is fitter to be raised than a decripid old woman who by the course of nature was to return to corruption again as soon as restored to life and a boy rather than an infirm old man for the same reason and lazarus the friend of jesus perhaps and but perhaps rather than his professed enemy but what are these three persons in comparison of many others of other circumstances instead of a boy and a girl and even of lazarus who were all of no consequence to the public either before or since i should think jesus ought to have raised an useful magistrate whose life had beed a common blessing an industrious merchant whose death was a public loss a father of a numerous family which for a comfortable subsistence depended on him such dead objects of jesuss power and compassion could not but offer themselves during the time of his ministry and if he meant to be as useful as he could in his miracles he would have laid hold on them if a few persons only were to be raised from the dead the foresaid were the properest whose resurrection and return to life would have begotten the applause as well as the wonder of the world would most extensively have spread jesuss fame and would have gained him the love and discipleship of all that heard of his being so great a benefactor to mankind such instances of his power would have demonstrated him to be a most benign as well as a mighty agent and none in interest or prejudice could have opened their mouths against him especially if the persons raised from the dead were selected upon the recommendation of the people of this or that city but that an insignificant boy and a girl forsooth and the obscure lazarus are preferred by jesus to such public and more deserving persons is unaccountable their story therefore upon this argument savours of romance and fraud and unless the mystery help us to what the letter cannot a good reason for jesuss conduct here the miracles may be hence justly questioned and the credibility of their report disputed  but now i am speaking of the fitness and unfitness of deceased persons to have this grand miracle wrought on them it comes into my head to ask why jesus raised not john the baptist to life again a person of greater merits and more worthy of the favor of jesus and of this miracle could not be if jesus could raise any from the dead he would surely have raised him and why did he not this is a reasonable question and an answer should be thought on for it was it a thing out of jesuss power not so he was omnipotent and could by force or persuasion have rescued johns head out of the hands of his enemies and the tacking it again to his body and the infusing new life into him was no more difficult to jesus than the resuscitation of a stinking carcass if jesus had here exerted his power and raised his dearest friend and choicest minister for the preparation if not propagation of the gospel none could question his ability to raise any others tho he had raised no more but in as much as john the baptist one of his singular merits and services to christ was overlooked and neglected by him and three useless and insignificant persons had this honor done them the facts may reasonably be called into question and if the mysteries dont solve the difficulty their litteral stories may hence be accounted foolish fictitious and fabulous especially if we consider    that none of these three raised persons had been long enough dead to amputate all doubt of jesuss miraculous power in their resurrection as to jairuss daughter she was but newly expired if at all dead when jesus brought her to life again jesus himself says she was but asleep and according to theophanes cerameus puellam ex illo tumultu plangentium stupore correptam esse non vero defunctam in homil de juri filia  and theophilact in loc matthae there is room to suspect that this girl was only  beside herself and it is not impossible but the passionate skreams of the feminine bystanders might fright her into fits that bore the appearance of death otherwise why did jesus turn these inordinate weepers out of the house before he could bring her to her senses again and why did he tell her parents that she was only in asleep but to comfort them with the possibility of his awakening her out of it is not this destructive of the miracle and making no more of it than what another man might do and is there not some probability that here is all of this story but supposing she was really dead yet for the sake of an indisputable miracle in her resurrection it must be granted that she ought to have been much longer some days if not weeks dead and buried  as to the widow of naims son there was somewhat more of the appearance of death in him than in jairuss daughter he was carried forth to his burial and so may be presumed to be really a dead corpse but might not here be fraud or mistake in the case history and common fame affords instances of the mistaken deaths of persons who sometimes have been unfortunately buried alive and at other times happily by one means or other restored to life and who knows but jesus upon some information or other might suspect this youth to be in a lethargick state and had a mind to try if by chafeing etc he could not do what successfully he did bring him to his senses again or might not a piece of fraud be here concerted between jesus a subtle youth and his mother and others and all the formalities of a death and burial contrived that jesus whose fame for a worker of miracles was to be raised might here have an opportunity to make a show of a grand one the mourning of the widow who had her tears at command and jesuss casual meeting of the corpse upon the road looks like contrivance to put the better face upon the matter god forbid that i should suspect there was any fraud of this kind here but of the possibility of it none can doubt and where there is a possibility of fraud it is nonsense and mere credulity to talk of a real certain and stupendous miracle especially where the juggler and pretended worker of miracles has been detected in some of his other tricks all that i have to say here to this matter is that if jesus had a mind to raise the son of this widow in testimony of his divine power he should have suffered him to have been buried two or three weeks first otherwise if the mystery dont account for jesuss stopping the bearers of the corpse upon the road here is too much room for suspicion of cheat in the letter of the story  lazaruss case seems to be the less exceptionable of the three he had been buried four days and supposed to be putrified in the opinion of his sister mary and of modern christians and if so his resuscitation was a most grand and indisputable miracle and i could have wished if i had not loved the mystery rather than the letter that no cavil and exception could have been made to it whether lazarus who was jesuss friend and beloved disciple would not come into measures with his lord for the defense of his honor and propagation of his fame infidels who take christianity for an imposture will not question and whether he would not consent to be interred alive in a hollow cave where there was only a stone laid at the mouth of it as long as a man could fast none of them will doubt four days was almost too long for a man to fast without danger of health but if those four days are numbered according to the arithmetic of jesus s three days in his grave they are reducible to two days and three nights which time if no victuals were secretly conveyed with him a man might fast in lazaruss cave as to the stinking of lazaruss carcass that infidels will say was but the assertion of his sister beforehand like a prologue to a farce none of the spectators at his resurrection say one word of his stinking and as to the weepings and lamentations of jesus and of lazaruss sisters they will say that was all sham and counterfeit the better to carry on the juggle of a feigned resurrection and what is worst of all they will say that tho jesus did call lazarus forth with a loud voice as if he had been as deaf as a dead man yet his face was bound about with a napkin so that the spectators could not discern what was of the essence of the miracle the change of his countenance from a dead to a live one which is a plain sign that it was all fraud and imposture  god forbid that i should have the same sense with infidels of this matter but to be just to their suggestions and imaginations here i must needs say there are some other unhappy circumstances presently to be considered in this story which if they are not emblematical make it the most notorious cheat and imposture that ever was put upon mankind in the mean time from what is here argued it is plain that lazarus was not so long dead and buried as that there is no room to doubt of the miracle of his resurrection  now whether these arguments against these three miracles drawn from the shortness of the time in which these persons lay for dead have any force in them let our divines consider if nothing of all this is in their opinion affecting of the credit of the miracles yet they must allow that jesus if he could raise the dead might have made choice of other instances of persons more unquestionably dead who had lain longer in their graves and were in a visible state of putrefaction and if this grand miracle of raising the dead was to be wrought by jesus for the manifestation of his glory and in testimony of his authority he should have exercised his power on some such persons nominated by the magistrates of this or that city who with the people should be present at the miraculous operation beholding the putrified bodies without a napkin before their faces and how they were suddenly enlivened and invigorated with new flesh after the similitude of their pristine form when in health and full strength because that jesus raised not some such persons to life i must take the stories of the three miracles before us to be but typical of more mysterious works or believe them for the arguments above to be downright cheats and fables and what is enough to induce a modern divine to this opinion is    the consideration that none of these raised persons did or could after the return of their souls to their bodies tell any tales of their separate existence otherwise the evangelists had not been silent in this main point which is of the essence of christianity are not our divines here reduced to an unhappy dilemma either to deny the separate existence of the soul or the precedent deaths of these raised persons as christians we profess to believe both which seemingly are incompatiable or the evangelists had made such a relation as their returned souls had given of the other world was any person in this age to be raised to life that had been any time dead the first thing that his friends and acquaintance would enquire of him would be to know where his soul had been in what company and how it had fared with him and historians would certainly record his narrative the same curiosity could not but possess people of old when these miracles were wrought and if the raised persons had told any stories of their separate existance the evangelists no less unquestionally would have reported them in as much as such a report would have been not only a confirmation of that doctrine which is of the essence of our religion but an absolute confutation of the sadducees and sceptists of that age and of the materialists of this but this their silence in this case is of bad consequence either to the doctrine of the souls existence in separation from the body or to these miracles themselves since we must hereupon almost necessarily hold that these raised persons were not at all dead or that their souls died with them  the author of a sermon ascribed to st augustine tells us atque ut miraculum divinae virtutis accresceret dum convivis interrogantibus tristia loca paenarum sedesque alta nocte semper obscuras lazarus indicat diligenti narratione per ordinem diu quaesiti longisque temporibus ignorati invenerunt tandem inferi prodm in sermon cxvi append st august that lazarus after his resurrection made a large report of hell where he had been but as this is a mere fiction of that author without the least authority from scripture so i presume it will be accounted a blunder in him to suppose the soul of lazarus the friend and beloved of jesus was in hell the soul of jesus indeed for reasons best known to himself upon his death descended into hell when some think he should rather have gone with the penitent thief into paradise but the thoughts that any of jesuss friends should go to hell i suppose will not be born with or what will become of the preachers of this age who would be accounted men of that denomination and if lazaruss soul had been in paradise it was hardly a good work in jesus to recall it for thirty years afterward to the miseries and troubles of this wicked world i wish therefore our divines could determine where lazaruss soul was for the four days of his burial because i cannot possibly conceive any thing else than that he was not really dead or that his soul died with him or went to a bad place otherwise after his resurrection he had never absconded for fear of the jews as if he was unwilling to die again and return to the place from whence he came  but however it was with the souls of these raised persons before their reunion to their bodies here is another difficulty and objection against these miracles and how will our divines get over it perhaps they may say that though these raised persons were before really dead yet their souls were not as yet gone to their places prepared of god for them but continued hovering about their bodies like the flame about the snuff of a candle with desires  iterumque reverti corpora  to be again rejoined to them and withal my heart let this answer pass if our divines and infidels can so agree upon it as for my own opinion it is this that these miracles of jesus are parables and that it was beside the purpose of the parable and of the evangelists to say any thing of the place and state of the soul upon its separation from the body otherwise the letter of their stories is manifestly obnoxious to the objection above or the deaths of these pretended raised persons upon christian principles are questionable but    and lastly let us consider the intrinsic absurdities and incredibilities of the several stories of these three miracles and such absurdities shall we find in them that if they had been intended as testimonies of jesuss divine power had never been inserted in their narratives  as to jairuss daughter and her resurrection from the dead st hilary princeps hic lex esse intelligitur quae dominum orat pro plebe quam ipsa christo praedicata ejus adventus expectatione nutriverat ut vi tam mortuae reddat nam nullum principem credidisse legimus ex quo persona hujus principis orantis merito in typum aptabitur in loc matt hints that there was no such person as jairus whose name was fictitious and coined with a spiritual signification for the use of the parable and he gives this reason and a good reason it is why he thought so because it is elsewhere john vii    and xii    intimated in the gospel that none of the rulers of the synagogues confessedly believed on jesus is not here then a stumbling block at the threshold of the letter of this story but why did jesus say this girl was but in a sleep if he was going to work a miracle in her resuscitation he should not have called death sleep but if others had been of a contrary opinion he should first have convinced them of the certainty of her death before he did the great work on her and why did he charge the parents of the girl not to speak of the miracle if he meant it as a testimony of his divine power he should rather have exhorted them in justice to himself to publish it and make it well known and why as st ambrose quae tamen tantae diversitatis causa supra public viduoe filius suscitatur hic removentur plures arbitri in loc luc puts the question did he turn the people out of the house before he would raise her the more witnesses are present at a miracle the better it is attested and the more readily believed by others and who should be present at the miracle rather than those who were incredulous of jesuss divine power are not all these circumstances so many absurdities which if they are not to be accounted for in the mystery are so far destructive of the letter as that it is nonsense and folly in our divines to talk of a miracle here against jesuss express word and prohibition to the contrary  as to the story of the widow of naims son excepting what is before observed of the shortness of the time in which he lay dead and of the unfitness of his person to be raised before an husband and father of a family to the comfort of his wife and children which are enough to overthrow the credility of the miracle i have here no more fault to find in the letter of it  but the long story of lazarus is so brimful of absurdities that if the letter alone is to be regarded st john who was then above a hundred when he wrote it had lived beyond his reason and senses or he could not have committed them  i have not room here to make remarks on all these absurdities which would be the work of a volume but shall single out three or four of them at present reserving the rest for another opportunity when the whole story of this miracle will appear to be such a contexture of folly and fraud in its contrivance execution and relation as is not to be equaled in all romantic history and our divines will find themselves so distressed upon the dissection and display of it as that they must of necessity allow this story to be but a parable or what is most grievous to think on give up their religion upon it  first then observe that jesus is said to have wept and groaned for the death of lazarus but why so says qua igitur ratione qui tanta haec erat facturus  quod evenit judicasset merito lacrymis esse prosequendum in homil de cratiarum action st basil was not this an absurdity to weep at all for the death of him whom he could and was about to recover to life again another man may as reasonably grieve for the absence of his friend whose company and presence he can retrieve in an instant as that jesus should shed tears for lazarus in this case if jesus could not or would not raise him from the dead he ought not as a philosopher who knows man is born to die to betray so much weakness as to weep for him patience and resignation unto god upon the death of our dearest friends and relations is what all philosophers have rightly taught and jesus one would think should have been the most heroical example of these graces and how came he to fail of it here a stoical apathy had better became him than such childish and effeminate grief which not only makes him a mean and poorspirited mortal but is a gross absurdity and incredibility upon consideration of his will and power to fetch lazarus to life again if there be not according to the fathers mystery in these tears of jesus they are a foolish and unnatural prelude to a farce he was acting in the pretended resuscitation of lazarus  some ancient catholics not being apprised of the mystery were so offended at these words jesus wept that as epiphanius lacrymatus est jesus quod aliquando erasum fuisse a catholicis quibusdam scribit epiphanius vid drusium in loc johan says they expunged them out of their bibles and i wonder they have not before now disturbed the faith of ministers of the letter to the utter rejection of the miracle  secondly observe that john says it was with a loud voice that jesus called lazarus forth out of his cave and why i pray a louder voice than ordinary was dead lazarus deafer than jairuss daughter or the widows son or was his soul at so great a distance from his body as he could not hear a still and low voice some such silly reason as this must be given for this loud voice here but how absurd it is according to the letter infidels will judge till christians can assign a better the dead can hear the whisper of the almighty if power go along with it as soon as the sound of a trumpet st john then should not have written of a loud voice unless he meant to adapt his story to the capacities and conceptions of the vulgar who have no apprehensions of gods power out of sensible and human representations of it  thirdly because that a miracle should be well guarded against all suspicion of fraud i was thinking to make it an absurdity that the napkin before jesus raised lazarus was not taken from his face that the spectators might behold his mortified looks and the miraculous change of his countenance from death unto life what infidels think of this circumstance i know not i hope it is not with them a token of fraud and imposture tho i must needs say that if the fathers did not let me into the mystery of the napkin about lazaruss face when jesus called him forth i should not my self like it  fourthly and lastly observe st john says v    that many of the jews who had seen the things that jesus did here believed on him and some of them v    who did not believe went their ways to the pharisees and told them what things jesus had done in this pretended miracle and how the business was transacted whereupon the chief priests and pharisees were so far incensed as v    from that day forth they took council together to put him to death and chapter xii  0 consulted that they might put lazarus also to death jesus therefore and his disciples and lazarus fled for it for they v    walked no more openly among the jews but went thence into a country near to the wilderness a convenient hiding place and there continued with his disciples otherwise in all probability they had been all sacrificed  i dare not argue upon these circumstances neither would i for the honor of jesus have mentioned them but that my old friend the jewish rabbi who helped me to the satirical invective against jesuss miracle of turning water into wine has hence formed an objection against lazaruss resurrection and sent me a letter upon it desiring me to publish it and exhort the clergy to answer it otherwise he would clandestinely hand it about to the prejudice of our religion whereupon i rather than christianity should so suffer do here publish it and it is as follows  sr when we last discoursed on jesuss miracles i promised to send you my thoughts on lazaruss resurrection which i look upon as a notorious imposture and for the proof of it need go no farther than to the circumstances of its story which your evangelist has related  if there had been an indisputable miracle wrought in lazaruss resurrection why were the chiefpriests and pharisees so incensed upon it as to take council to put both jesus and lazarus to death for it where was the provocation i can conceive none though the jews were ever so cankered with malice and hatred to jesus before yet such a most stupendous miracle was enough to stop their mouths and turn their hearts or if their prejudices against jesus were insuperable and they hated him but the more for the number and greatness of his miracles yet why is poor lazarus inoffensive lazarus upon whom this good and great work was wrought an object of their hatred too your divines are to give a credible and probable account of this matter such a one as will comport with reason and sense or we shall conclude that it was fraud detected in this pretended miracle which justly provoked the indignation of our ancestors  to say what is all you can say that it was downright inhumanity barbarity and brutality in the jews to hate lazarus as well as jesus will not do here though this may pass with many christians who are ready to swallow without chewing any evil reports of our nation yet it cannot go down with reasonable and unprejudiced men who must have other conceptions of human nature in all ages and nations than to think it possible that a man in lazaruss case can be hated and persecuted for having had such a good and wonderful work done on him and why then was he hated and persecuted i say for this and no other reason than because he was a confederate with jesus in the wicked imposture he was putting upon mankind  but supposing what is never to be granted that the jews of old were so inhuman brutish and barbarous as to hate and persecute lazarus as well as jesus for this miracle yet why did jesus and his disciples with lazarus run away and abscond upon it for they v    walked no more openly among the jews but went thence into a country near to the wilderness and there jesus continued with his disciples is not here a plain sign of guilt and of fraud men that have gods cause truth and power on their side never want courage and resolution to stand to it and however your christian priests may palliate the cowardly and timorous conduct of jesus and his confederates in this case yet with me it is like demonstration that there was a discovered cheat in the miracle or they would undauntedly have faced their enemies without fears and apprehensions of danger from them  our ancestors then who unquestionably detected the fraud were in the right on it to prosecute with severity the whole party concerned in it and if they had avenged the wickedness of it upon lazarus as well as they did upon jesus i should have commended them for it whether such a monstrous imposture as was this pretended miracle happily discovered does not call aloud for vengeance and most exemplary punishment and whether any nation of the world would suffer the like with impunity let any man judge  for all the reports of your gospels it is unnatural to hate a miraculous healer of diseases and there must be somewhat suppressed about the inveteracy of the jews to jesus or his healing power if it was so great as is imagined must have reconciled them to him but that they should hate not only jesus for raising the dead but the person raised by him is improbable incredible and impossible  if historians can parrallel this story of the malignity of the jews toward jesus and lazarus upon such a real miracle with any thing equally barbarous and inhuman in any other sect or nation we will acknowledge the truth of it against our ancient nation or if such inhumanity abstractedly considered be at all agreeable to the conceptions any one can form of human nature in the most uncivilisd and brutish people we will allow our ancestors in this case to have been that people  was such a real and indisputable miracle as this of lazarus is supposed to be wrought at this day in confirmation of christianity i dare say it would bring all us jews to a man into the belief of it and i dont think it possible for any people to be so begotten biased and prejudiced as not to be wrought on by it or if they would not part with their interests and prejudices upon it they would have more wit and temper than to break forth into a rage against all or any of the persons concerned in it and for my life i can entertain no worse thoughts of our old nation  supposing god should send an ambassador at this day who to convince christians of the mischiefs and inconvenience of an hireling priesthood should work such a miracle as was this of lazaruss resurrection in the presence of a multitude of spectators how would your bishops and clergy behave themselves upon it why they would be as mute as fishes or if they did fret and grieve inwardly for the loss of their interests yet they would have more prudence ask them else than to show their anger openly and persecute both agent and patient for it wherefore then are they so censorious and uncharitable as to preach and believe another notion and doctrine of our ancestors  but if a false prophet for the subversion of an hireling priesthood should in spite to the clergy counterfeit such a miracle and be detected in the operation how then would priests and people magistrates and subjects behave upon it why they would be full of indignation and from that day forth would take council to put the impostor and his confederate to death of which they would be most deserving and if they did not abscond and fly for it like jesus and his disciples to a wilderness in the country to hide themselves the rage of the populace would hardly wait the leisure of justice to dispatch and make terrible examples of them was not this exactly the case of jesuss imposture in the resurrection of lazarus and of the punishment he was threatened with and afterward most justly underwent for it  mankind may be in some cases very obdurate and so hard of belief as to stand it out against sense reason and demonstration but i will not think worse of our ancestors than of the rest of mankind or that they any more than others would have withstood a clear and indisputable miracle in lazaruss resuscitation such a manifest miracle let it be wrought for what end and purpose we can possibly imagine would strike men with awe and reverence and none could hate and persecute the author of the miracle least he who could raise the dead should exert his power against themselves and either wound or sinite them dead with it for which reason the resurrection of lazarus on the certain knowledge of our ancestors was all fraud or they would have reverenced and adored the power of him that did it  it may be true what john says that many of the jews who had seen the things that jesus did believed on him that is believed that he had wrought here a great miraale but who were these the ignorant and credulous whom a much less juggler than mr fawkes could easily imposed on but on the other hand it is certain according to christian commentators that some of them did not believe the miracle but went their ways to the pharisees and told them what things jesus had done that is told them after what manner the intrigue was managed and complained of the fraud in it how they came to suspect and discover the fraud was not john business to relate and for want  other ancient memorials we can only guess at it perhaps they discerned some motion in lazaruss body before the word of command to come forth was given perhaps they discovered some fragments of the food that for four days in the cave he had subsisted on but however this was they could not but take notice of the napkin about his face all the while which jesus to prevent all suspicion of cheat should have first ordered to be taken off that his mortified countenance might be viewed before the miraculous change of it to life was wrought this neglect in jesus which i wonder john had no more wit than to hint at will be a lasting objection to the miracle jesus was wiser than not to be aware of the objection which he would have obviated if he durst by a removal of the napkin to the satisfaction of all spectators there present because this was not done we jews now deny there was any miracle wrought and whether our unbelief upon this circumstance be not well grounded we appeal to christian priests themselves who must own that if there was a miracle here the matter was ill conducted by jesus or foolishly related by his evangelist  it is a sad misfortune that attends our modern enquiry after truth that there are no other memorials extant of the life and miracles of jesus than what are written by his own disciples not only old time has devoured but christians themselves which in the opinion of the impartial makes for us when they got power into their hands wilfully destroyed many writings of our ancestors as well as of celsus and porphiry and others which they could not answer otherwise i doubt not but they would have given us clear light into the imposture of lazaruss resurrection but if jesus according to his own evangelists was arraigned for a deceiver and blasphemer in pretending to the sonship and power of god by his miracles in all probability this piece of fraud in lazarus was one article of the indictment against him and what makes it very likely is that the chief priests and pharisees from the date of this pretended miracle took council together to put him to death not clandestinely or tumultuously to murder him but judicially to punish him with death which if they proved their indictment by credible and sufficient witnesses he was most worthy of  as it is plain from the story in john that there was a dispute among the bystanders at lazaruss resurrection whether it was a real miracle or not so it is the opinion of us jews which is of the nature of a tradition that the chiefpriests and civil magistrates of bethany for the better determination of the dispute and quieting of the minds of the people required that jesus should react the miracle upon another person there lately dead and buried but jesus declining this test of his power the whole multitude of believers as well as of unbelievers before questioned the resurrection of lazarus and were highly incensed against both him and jesus for the deceit in it and this was one reason among others of that vehement and universal outcry and demand at jesuss trial for his crucifixion i will not answer for the certainty of this tradition or opinion but as the expedient was obvious so it has the face of truth and credibility and for the proof of it i need only appeal to christain priests and magistrates whether under a dispute of a miracle of that consequence they would not require for full satisfaction it should be acted over again and if the juggler refused whether there would not be a general clamor of people of all ranks for his execution  matthev mark and luke who knew as much of this sham miracle as john had not the confidence to report it because when they wrote many eyewitnesses of the fraud were alive to disprove and contradict them therefore they confined their narratives to jesuss less juggling tricks that had passed more current but after the jewish state was dissolved their judicial records were destroyed and every body dead that could confute him john ventures abroad the story of this miracle and if the good providence of god had not infatuated him in the insertion of the circumstances here observed it might have passed through all generations to come as well as it has done for many past for a grand miracle  thus sir have you a few of my thoughts on the pretended miracle of lazaruss resurrection i have more to bestow on it but that i would not be tedious there is no need to argue against the other two resurrectionstories you know omne majus includit minus and if the greatest of the three miracles be an imposture the two less ones of consequence are artifice and fraud and rather than the miracle of lazarus shall stand its ground i will have the other bout at it from some other circumstances the consideration of which will make it as foolish and wicked an imposture as ever was contrived and transacted in the world such a wicked imposture of most pernicious consequence to the welfare of the public that it is no wonder the people by an unanimous voice called for the releasement of barabbas a robber and murderer before jesus i dont suppose these arguments against this miracle will be convincing of your christian clergy who are hired to the belief of it but however a bishop of many thousands a year to believe cannot in conscience deny that the arguments above are a sufficient justification of our jewish disbelief of it  if you sir should write a discourse against the letter of the story of jesuss resurrection i beg of you to accept of a few of my conceptions on that head which i promise you shall be out of the common road of thinking your divines think they have exhausted that subject and absolutely confuted all objections that can be made against it but are much mistaken sometimes we jews dip into their writings on this head and always smile with indignation at their foolish invectives against the blindness of the eyes and hardness of the hearts of our ancestors if they would but favor us with a liberty to write for our selves a reasonable liberty which in this philosophical age we dont despair of especially under so wise just and good a civil administration as this nation is happily blessed with we would cut them out some more work which they are not aware of in the mean time i am your assured friend  n n   so ends the letter of my friend the jewish rabbi which consists of calm and sedate reasoning or i would not have published it for i am resolved he shall no more impose upon me with his ludicrous and bantering stuff like his satirical invective against jesuss miracle of turning water into wine so offensive to our godly bishops and because it consists of calm and sedate reasoning which bishop smalbroke allows of i hope his lordship will take it into consideration and write an answer to it which i without the help of the mystery cannot do  if the foresaid letter be offensive to our clergy who dont judge it meet that the jews should take this liberty to write against the miracles of our savior and in vindication of their own disbelief of christianity i beg of them for the love of jesus not to let their displeasure be visibly seen because the jews will then laugh in their sleeves and perhaps openly insult and triumph upon it but if they will privately acquaint me with their displeasure at it i will promise them to hold no more correspondence with such jewish rabbis neither will i ever hereafter publish any other objections against christs religion and miracles than what come from the hotentots and pawawers and then it will be strange if our dignified clergy of most grave and demure looks cannot solidly confute the worst that such ignorant and illiterate people can urge against them  and thus have i done with my objections against the letter of these three miracles if our divines shall think there is little or nothing of force in them then an answer which i should be glad to see may the more easily be made to them as for my part without being conceited of the acuteness and strength of any of the objections i think it impossible satisfactorily to reply to them without having recourse to the opinions of the fathers that these three miracles whether they were ever literally transacted or not are now but emblematical representations of mysterious and more wonderful operations to be performed by jesus  to the fathers then let us go for their mystical interpretation of these miracles st augustine in his introduction to a sermon on the widow of naims son says quidam corporalia ejus miracula stupentes majora intueri non norunt quidam vero ea quae gesta audiunt in corporibus nunc amplius in animis admirantur  dominus enim noster jesus christus ea quae faciebat corporaliter etiam spiritaliter volebat intelligi neque enim miracula propter miracula faciebat sed ut illa quae faciebat mira essent videntibus vera essent intelligentibus  alii and facta mirati and intellecta assecuti tales nos esse debemus in schola christi  hoc dixi de ficu arefacta ut persuaderem dominum jesum christum ideo miracula fecisse ut aliquid illis miraculis significaret ut excepto eo quod mira and magna and divina erant aliquid inde etiam disceremus videamus ergo quid nos discere voluit in tribus mortuis quos suscitavit in sermon xcviii thus there are some so silly as to stand amazed at the corporal miracles of jesus and have no consideration of his greater and spiritual miracles signified by them but others who are wiser can hear of the things that jesus did on mens bodies without being astonished at them choosing rather to contemplate with admiration his more wonderful works on mens souls after the similitude of bodily miracles and these are the christians that conform their studies to the will of our lord who would have his corporal miracles spiritually interpreted for he wrought not micles in the flesh for the sake of such miracles abstractedly considered but that if they were surprising to some mens senses they should be more astonishing to the understanding of others who apprehend the spiritual meaning of them and they who by contemplation can attain to the mystical signification of jesuss miracles are the best scholars and most learned disciples in his church and school and  speaking of the absurdity of jesuss cursing the figtree according to the letter presently after says that this he observed that he might persuade his hearers to think that our lord jesus therefore wrought miracles that he might signify somewhat by them which he would have his disciples to learn and consider of come now says he and let us see what we are mistically and spiritually to understand by the stories of the three persons raised from the dead  there are two ways that the fathers took in the moral and mystical interpretation of these miracles one was from the number three and their difference in magnitude according to which they said with st augustine ista tria genera mortuorum sunt tria genera  rum quos hodie suscitat christus  sunt ergo instar filiae synagogae principis qui peccatum intus in cord babent in facto nondum habent condemnatur consensus ad iniquitatem respiratur ad salutem atque justitiam surgit mortuus in domo reviviscit cor in cogitationis secreto facta est ista resurrectio animae mortuae intus intra latebras conscientiae tanquam intra domesticos parietes  alii post consensum eunt in factum tanquam efferentes mortuum ut quod latebat in secreto appareat in publico nonne illi juveni dictam est tibi dico surge and redditus est matri sic qui jam fecerit si forte admonitus and commotus verbo veritatis ad christi vocem resurgit vivus redditur ecclesiae  qui autem faciendo quod malum est etiam mala consuetudine se implicant tales consuetudine maligna pressi tanquam sepulti ita sepulti ut de lazaro dictum est jam putet in sermon xcviii that these three sorts of dead persons so raised to life are figures of three sorts of sinners whom jesus raises from the death of sin to the life of righteousness they who have conceived sin in their hearts and have not brought it forth into act are figured by jairuss daughter who lay dead in the house of her father and was not taken forth to her burial others who after cogitation and consent pass into actual sin are figured by the young man carried toward his grave but those sinners who are habituated and long accustomed to sin are like lazarus buried and in a stinking condition under the corruption of it whom jesus for all that with the loud voice of the praedication of his gospel will call forth out of the death and grave of their sins to a new life so does st augustine make these three dead persons and their resurrections emblems of the said three sorts of sinners who are dead in trespasses and sins and by the power of jesus quickened to a life of righteousness and to this opinion of st augustine do st ambrose eusebius gallicanus and venerable bede agree and according to this notion of these miracles they descend to a particular explication of the several parts of their stories as to give you two or three instances  the people who were turned out of the house upon the raising of jariuss daughter which is an absurdity according to the letter are says cum ejecta esset turba intravit moraliter non esurgit anima quae intrinsecus jacet mortua nisi prius a secretioribus cordis excludatur inopportuna saecularium cogitationum multitudo in loc matt bid a multitude of wordly and wicked thoughts which except they are excluded from the secrets of the heart are a hindrance of the resurrection of a sinner to a new life  the bearers of the young man mali isti portitores qui ad sepeliendum hominem ferunt sunt vitia and maligni spiritus haeretici and seductores hos enim nisi dominus sisteret quoscunque semel acciperent sepulturae and aeternae damnationi traderent suscitatus igitur adolescens sedet loquitur and matri redditur quia ad penitentiam conversus in ecclesiae pace quiescit dei magnalia loquitur sua peccata confitetur and ecclesiae reconciliatur eusebius gallic in homil feriae quintae post domin   tam to his burial are vices evil spirits haereticks and seducers and the widow his mother to whom he was restored is the church who mourns for the death of such sinners as are typified by that young man  jesuss weeping for dead lazarus which is an absurdity according to the letter is a sign et lacrymatus est jesus lacrymemur igitur and nos pro omnibus illis quos in faetore vitiorum jacere entimus eusebius gallic in homil feriae   tae post domin   tam of the deplorable state that habitual sinners are in enough to excite the sorrows and mournings of good christians who have the spirit of christ for them and the stone that lay at the grave of lazarus is lapis autem revolutus a monumento significat infidelitatis duritiam ab hominum cord submotam theop antioch in loc johan a figure of the hardness of the heart of such a sinner which must be taken away before jesus will call him to a new life so do the fathers moralize and allegorise every minute circumstance of these three miracles as any one who will consult them may find and save me the trouble of a tedious recital of their authorities  but the other mystical way of interpreting these three miracles is by making them types of three great events at the time of christs spiritual advent accordingly the raising of jairuss daughter is a type of the conversion of the jews at that day as eusebius gallicanus quod enim tunc temporis factum est in una puella hoc in fine temporum futurum est ut fiat in tota sonagoga in homil feriae   ta post domin   tam and venerable bede synagoga circa finem saeculi erit restituta saluti in loc matt and others expound it by jairus the ruler of a synagogue is meant moses jairus illuminatus vel illuminans moses intelligitur bed in loc mat  and by his daughter is to be understood the jewish church which being at present in a state of spiritual death will be revived and converted in the perfection of time and to the mystical resurrection or restitution of the jewish synagogue called jairuss daughter will jesus come ad hanc ergo principis filiam dum properat dei verbum ut salvos faceret filios israel sancta ecclesia de gentibus congregata quae inferiorum lapsu criminum deperibat paratam aliis fide praeripuit sanitatem st ambros in loc luc quod vero post restitutam immundae mulieri valetudinem defuncta puella a mortuis restituitur ne hoc quidem ab exquisita allegoria alienum nam reliquiae salvae fiant juxta apostolum cum ingressa fuerit gentium plenitudo theop ceram in homil de jairi filia at the same time he heals the woman of the church of her issue of blood and this is the reason that the stories of these two miracles are blended together by the evangelists with their synchronical numbers of the age of the girl and of the disease of the woman because they are types of that blessed scene of affairs at the conversion of the jews when the fullness of the gentiles is come in concerning which blessed state of the church origin quarum rerum causa multa fuere jesu miracula in johan cap xi says jesus wrought many miracles by way of type and figure  among all the miracles that jesus wrought and are recorded by the evangelists i think as far as i have had occasion to observe the fathers are most scanty in their interpretations of that of the widow of naims son excepting what is before noted of his being a figure of a sinner dead in actual tho not habitual sin i find very little but if origens comments on this miracle had been extant i dare say he would have given us this following interpretation of it this widow he would have called the church and her only son or masculine offspring he would have called the spiritual sense of the scriptures which is now dead and that the ministers of the letter who are his bearers are for interring him within the earth of the letter but jesus upon his spiritual advent will put a stop to the intention of such bearers by reviving the spiritual sense of the scriptures and by restoring it like a quickened son to the comfort of his mother the church who has been in a sorrowful and lamentable condition upon the death and want of it this i am sure would be origens interpretation of this miracle which if i had room here by a little circumlocution i could prove  as to lazaruss resurrection it is in the opinion of the fathers per lazarum genus humanum ostenditur theop antioch in loc johan nostra resurrectio figuratur per lazari resurrectionem  spelunca sive sepulchrum lazari litteram legis umbratilem designat  magna voce clamavit jesus id  praedicatio evangelii per quam humana natura peccatorum vinculis and in scpulchro infidelitatis jacens vocatur ad vitam theop ceram in homil de lazaro a type of the general and mystical resurrection of mankind in the perfection of time but this is a most copious subject and unless i could here thoroughly handle it i had much better say nothing  and thus have i done with the three resurrection stories if the convocation next session would determine by an orthodox vote whether jesus raised any more than the said three persons from the dead or not i would present them with a new and more entertaining chain of thoughts against these miracles such a chain of thoughts as upon the conclusion let them hold which side of the question they please will necessarily induce us to hold the mystical meaning of these miracles or to grant that jesus raised none from the dead at all  my next and last discourse on jesuss miracles shall be against the letter of the story of his own resurrection in which if our bishops will keep their temper and patience till i publish it i will cut out such a piece of work for our boylean lectures as shall hold them tug so long as the ministry of the letter and an hireling priesthood shall last if christ be not risen then according to the inference of st paul is their preaching vain and why should the people be any longer charged with the maintenance of an ignorant and idle order of men to no use and purpose  if i had not had experience of it i could never have believed that for all the ludicrous nature of these discourses our dignified clergy could have been so foolish or malicious as to prosecute me for an infidel and blasphemer upon them how a man may be mistaken in himself i took my self for a real advocate for the truth of christianity and was so vain as to imagine these discourses tended to a demonstration of jesuss messiahship and tho the bishop of london may be of a contrary opinion yet i am still so conceited of my ability to defend our religion that i will stake my life against his bishopric which i will not be troubled with if i win it that he cannot form an objection against christianity which i cannot solidly confute and make our readers merry too with his weakness and impertinence in it but perhaps it may be unbecoming of his lordships character and against the grain to make an objection to that religion which he finds much temporal as well as some spiritual comfort in the profession of i will therefore descend to another proposal viz if he will but publish an answer to the jewish rabbis letter in this discourse and vouchsafe me the pleasure of a reply to him then to save the civil magistrates trouble i will suffer any punishment that in his clemency he shall think fit to inflict on me for what is past oh what a hazard do i here run of life or liberty  some christians in my case would think it a sad misfortune to be odiously represented as an infidel and blasphemer but i in temper and principle despise such obloquies slanders and defamations and would not give a rush to remove them so long as i had the answer of a good conscience that i was undeserving of them but considering that it is the duty of a christian to seek the peace and friendship of all about him and especially of our good bishops who in compassion to the danger they think my soul is in have taken zealous and laudable pains with the civil magistrate for my conviction and conversion i do here for the sake of a reconciliation with their lordships and other good people make a formal and solemn confession of my christian faith which though i dont express in the words of the apostical nicene or athanasian creeds yet will do it in such terms as will be a demonstration that at the bottom i am sound as a roch be it known then to all christian people that  imprimis i believe upon the authority of the fathers that the ministry of the letter of the old and new testament is downright antichristianism item i believe upon the authority of the fathers that the miracles of jesus as they are recorded by the evangelists literally understood are the lying wonders of antichrist item i believe upon the authority of the fathers that all opposition and contradiction to spiritual and allegorical interpretations of the scripture is the sin of blasphemy against the holy ghost item i believe upon the authority of the fathers that the ministry of the spirits or allegorical interpretations of the law and the prophets will be the conversion of jews and gentiles item i believe upon the authority of the fathers that the ministry of the letter and an hirelingpriesthood have been the cause of the infidelity and apostasy of these latter times item i believe upon the authority of the fathers that the spirit and power of jesus will soon enter the church and expel hirelingpriests who make merchandise of the gospel out of her after the manner he is supposed to have driven the buyers and sellers out of the temple these are a few articles of that faith once delivered to the saints of the primitive church which i firmly believe and will earnestly contend for now i appeal to the christian world whether a man of such a faith like heart of oak can be an infidel or blasphemer upon this ingenuous confession of my faith which i make by way of atonement for my past supposed errors and offenses i hope the bishops and all good christian people will be reconciled to me  st james says that faith without works is dead and how a man ought to how his faith by his works without which faith is an empty and airy nothing accordingly i am making what haste i can to show the sincerity of my faith by these my works and discourses of this kind and by the grace of god i hope our bishops will find me as unmovable as a rock in the said faith  according to the foresaid articles of this my faith i am so fully convinced not only of the error of the ministry of the letter but of the mischiefs and inconveniences of an hirelingpriesthood that having set my shoulders to the work i am resolved by the help of god to endeavor to give both a lift out of this world this is fair and generous warning to our clergy to sit fast and look to their own safety or they may find me a stronger man than they may be aware of and tho i dont expect long to survive the accomplishment of so great and glorious a work yet i am delightfully ravished and transported with the forethought and contemplation of the happiness of mankind upon the extinction of ecclesiastical vermin out of gods house when the world will return to its primogenial and paradisaical state of nature religion and liberty in which we shall be all taught of god and have no need of foolish and contentious priest hired to harangue us with his noise and nonsense which blessed state of the world god of his infinite
