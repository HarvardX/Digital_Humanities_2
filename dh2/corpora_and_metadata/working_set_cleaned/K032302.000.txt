marplot or the second part of the busiebody a comedy as it is acted at the theater royal in drury lane by her majestys servants  written by mrs susanna centlivre  london printed for jacob tonson at shakespeares head over against catherinestreet in the strand       to the right honorable henry bentinck earl of portland viscount woodstock baron of cirencester captain of her majestys first troop of guards etc my lord women and men like women naturally fly to the brave for protection this pretense marplot and i have for addressing to your lordship we know it is the peculiar distinction of noble minds that they are ready to receive under their care the distressed though they have no other merit than that they beseech their patronage  when i say this my lord i would not be understood to conceal that my play has been very kindly received but we women overlook all praise but from those persons whose approbation we most esteem we are apt to be carried away from admirers to those we admire and this comedy prefers the honor of being thrown at your feet to the applause of an audience it is the misfortune of our sex that we are deterred from the advantages of a learned education but as our expressions are artless our sentiments are less disguised had i my lord the skill of a writer i should here record your noble fathers zeal for his royal master and celebrate that care and fidelity which preserved the life of our deliverer but instead of mentioning this obligation which my late lord portland laid on every man in england i confine my self to what we owe him for being your father  that your lordship may long bless the world with the same virtues which you have shown in the entrance you have made on the busy stage of it and long enjoy the advantages of an affluent fortune graceful person and generous mind is the ardent prayer of  my lord your lordships most devoted most obedient humble servant susanna centlivre  prologue the men of wit do now their brains fatigue so much with politics and stateintrigue that there is not one malepoet of the age will condescend to labor for the stage therefore our author though no rules she knows what nature prompts with artless hand bestows you will see the subject for the genius fit a busiebody drawn by female wit still on the hunt to know of others wooing eternally employed and nothing doing into dear secrets anxiously they press destroying even where they wish success the scanty age all better fare denies and no new characters the town supplies some years ago wit had a larger field and every room could fresh stagecoxcombs yield but long has been all humorous folly crossed all fool in empty politicians lost scowrers and rakes and debauchees are over beaux are extinct and bullies are no more therefore in scarcity of homebred tools your treat to nights composed of foreign fools and though our marplot has been shown before the fool may differ on a different shore  for once then break old custom be not oernice but let the selfsame woman please you twice dramatis personae men don lopez a noble portuguese brother to dona perriera mr bowen don perriera a rich merchant mr dogget colonel ravelin an

would preserve it i say my sister your wife is a strumpet the strumpet of a damned heretic i saw the looks nay the signs she gave some of the english officers as she came from church this morning   d per english officers   d lop english i am sure they were i cannot swear they were all officers nor could i perceive which she signed to or he should not live to meet her wishes  now if you dont like the name of cuckold find another for the husband of a whore if you can  for my part i know of none but this i know if you will not punish her as a wife i will as a sister she shall not stain the honor

not drive honor would come slowly on art thou turned merchant then   cha no faith not i but it pleased heaven to take my wifes father out of the way who left me executor and his concerns here obliged me to take this voyage   rav so then old sir jealous traffic is dead at last how long do you intend to stay   cha longer than i expected when i embarked i came away in such a hurry the ship sailing sooner than i thought she would i forgot to put up some papers without which i cannot adjust my accounts with some merchants here i have writ to my wife to send them   rav that was very unlucky prithee how do thou spend thy time   cha why very insipidly how do you pass yours what company have you here   rav all sorts the women i will say that for em are kind enough and will not put you to the expense of swearing and lying to gain them but a man is as safe in an engagement as in their arms fortune is the kind friend in both the onsets but i have got acquainted in a french family which are not altogether so dangerous one way but much more so another   cha ay how is that colonel   rav why i am fearful of dwindling into an honorable amor there   cha exert your gallantry gain your point once and those fears will vanish the french ladies are easy of access   rav right the french gayety resembles the english complaisance yet they have always a reserve to dash your expectations and when you think your self in a manner master of their coverdway they spring a mine of coquetry and blow you up at once   cha say you so colonel why then give me the lisbon dames that surrender to the bold and brave he deserves not a woman that would not run some hazard provided she be kind   rav some are of opinion that the jilting fair gives the surest blow and sucklin says it is expectation makes the blessing dear this french woman has found the way to unite my jarring inclinations and tune em to the pitch of constancy and i am very apprehensive of becoming that tame monster called a husband ah i find i am caught for i can name that terrible word without starting   cha ha ha ha i shall have you in my class sure the lady that can make such an entire conquest over your heart must be a person of extraordinary parts colonel   rav yes faith her ladyship has very extraordinary parts she is airy to affectation and changeable as the wind she has tongue enough for a lawyer but as hard to be understood as an apothecary she begins as many stories as a romance and ends them as intricately or to speak more properly seldom ends them at all she is as whimsical as a projector as obstinate as a physician and as faithful as the monarch of her country   cha admirable qualities for a wife and can you forsake the whole sex for this woman   rav humph that i will not swear but i find i cannot forsake her for the whole sex to be plain with you i have tried the strength of variety and at this time am in prospect of the favor from as fine a woman as any in lisbon yet this medly of womankind triumphs over all and in the midst of my raptures i murmur joneton   cha but may i not see this wondrous engineer who can countermine her whole sex and blow up the magazine of your affections colonel   rav you shall but you must give me your honor not to rival me   cha the description you have given colonel secures you from that fear besides you know i am married neither am i destitute of a mistress though in a strange place i this morning was a assured by a sign from a ladys hankerchief that my wants should be supplied upon occasion i did not rightly understand her till the good old duena explained her meaning and this night i shall be happy in her arms   rav you are a stranger to these affairs charles take heed proceed with caution for the women here are as warm in their revenge as in their inclinations bare suspicion justifies murder if you manage your intreague so closely to escape the husband and relations it is odds but your mistress finds some pretense to employ her bravoes fellows that will dispatch a dozen men for a moydre   cha i go well armed understand the language and will not easily fall a victime but resolve to see the event of this intreague the old matron told me that the lady was young and beautiful her husband a merchant rich covetous old and ugly that she hated him worse than penance and loved me better than her prayers shall i be such a poultroon to decline a ladys summons no for the honor of britain it shall never be said an englishman fled either from the wars of mars or venus let her bring me on if i discharge not my self with honor and make my retreat secure may i forfeit the embraces of the sex   rav well said charles in my conscience you married men encroach too much upon our prerogative methinks you who purchase pleasure by way of annuity should leave us batchellours the liberty of the freehold   cha the ground we course in is never the worse for your use   rav no it is sometimes the better there is many a wife lies fallow and many a good estate would want an heir if it were not for us young fellows especially soldiers   cha i think you ought to make provision for the recruits you raise as much as for your widows they are far more numerous  a noise of clashing of swords and murder cried within rav ha what noise is that   cha it is marplots voice his damned curiosity has brought him into some mischief i will lay my life on it  draws rav the devils in that fellow what made you bring him with you  murder cried again within mar murder murder mar running pursued by two bravoes ah charles help me dear charles for heavens sake  they beat off the bravoes cha a curse on your paper skull what have you been doing now   mar nothing at all as i hope to be saved only i had a mind to see where that lady lived that shook her handkerchief at you and out of no other design than to inform you i protest charles when immediately these two scoundrels came slap upon me i know no more for what than the child that is unborn but i am sure i shall feel their blows this month pox take em   rav for what why you took the only method in the world to have your guts let out ha ha watch a woman in lisbon hark you young gentleman suppress that natural curiosity of diving into other peoples affairs or never hope to see old england again   mar i wish i were safe in it colonel ravelin the duce take me if i saw you before my senses was all in such a hurry with these unconscionable villains that    cha that you overlooked your friends i warrant   mar you have said it charles but i hope the colonel will forgive me   rav to be plain with you mr marplot i shall take these kind of oversights for particular favors if you dont shake off that temper of yours   mar pish prithee colonel dont put on those grave airs why what harm is there in it   rav there is ill manners in it i am sure and have a care you have not your bones broke for it   cha look ye marplot you must either resolve to quit this inquisitive humor or forfeit my acquaintance   rav a man may be ruined by your foolish quarrels   mar upon my soul colonel i never quarreled with any man out of design to hurt him in my life charles can witness for me that i hate fighting   cha so can every body else that knows you i wish you hated impertinence as much for the good of society   mar well you of all men living have the least reason to complain i have run the hazard of my life many a time for you and in my conscience i believe i shall fall your martyr one time or another   cha your own you mean you will certainly be canonized by all the busiebodys about town   mar is this all the thanks i get for my friendship well charles well you shall see i can prefer safety and sacrifice my curiosity too as you call it   rav that is the way to oblige your friends mr marplot never desire to know more than they are willing to tell you readily comply with a reasonable demand and never meddle with any bodys business but your own this will render you agreeable to all companies   mar ay but that will make all companies very disagreeable to me  aside but colonel is there nothing due from one friend to another one ought to be let into the bosom secrets of a friend   rav not always for there are some secrets of such a nature that will not admit of that freedom for example suppose your friend had an affair with another mans wife or daughter where is the advantage of your knowing it   mar why i would watch the husband or father in the mean time prevent his being surpised and perhaps save his life   cha but how would you save his honor a man of honor must have no confidents in those cases   mar then hang honor i say it is good for nothing but to spoil conversation shall i beg a pinch of your snuff colonel   enter colonel

wound in the reputation of an english woman they say only lets in allimony but with us it lets out life and therefore though we proceed with caution a lover ought to think us sincere when we run such

he deserves it this busy humor of his is as natural to him as his food he followed me home this morning i was forced to use him very roughly to get rid of him for you must know i have a trap door in my chimney through which i descend into a back street where i am conducted by an old negro to an angel of a woman i had her summons and the hour of assignation was come when he entered my chamber   cha a very unseasonable visit faith colonel   rav ay was it not but i quickly dispatched him though how he stumbld upon you afterward and in so odd a manner is a miracle   cha if he lives we shall

sir if you go to that i would have you to believe i can keep my friends secrets when entrusted i dont know his lodgings find them out as you can   isab you are very short sir i have nothing to say against your secrecy but it would be impudence in me to run the hazard besides forestalling your friends generosity he ought to have the disposal of his own secrets   mar ay if it comes into his hands once twill cost me more pains to find out than it is worth   isab pains to find out i hope you never endeavor to find out what other people would conceal   mar no yes to choose why the duce should any

understand me   isab too well  the rest of his mistresses has he such store then   mar as many as he can well manage i believe   isab oh my heart the danger of intreaguing in this place alarms my fears and shocks my very soul   mar what i have said makes you thoughtful i perceive will no body do but charles what think you of me   isab why really sir were i a woman i should prefer you before him but i cannot answer for my lady if you please i will mention you   mar your most humble servant sir  egad there may be new pleasure in having an intreague of ones own for ought i know for i never had one in my life aside   isab but sir there is one article in our agreement which you have not performed   mar what is that   isab where your friend lodges   mar why he lodges at yon green windows where if you have any service from your lady for your humble servant you will find me there also   isab sir i kiss your hand i will do my best to serve you  ex mar sir i kiss yours  i am glad he is

what is it to be one then for life ye powers where husbands too are ten times worse than ours the slightest trip with them demands our blood but venial frailties here are better understood your don cornuted is a monster there but thank our stars the fates no wonder here the monster ceases where the case is common and watch your eyes out you must trust the woman in vain her person with restraint you load when spite of walls her willing minds abroad a blessed life indeed where churlish fear attends the thing your appetites could spare is there on earth a wretch a greater jest than the pale lover starved for beautys feast that begs in pity of his famished sense a taste protest his appetite shall last for ages  gry fit to eat for life engages  ld our guest falls bravely to  m feeding grew  eeds  like husband feeds  trimonial mien  inly seen incurable his pain and laughed at in distress he snarling cries consume my happiness oh tiresome plenty o intolerable bliss oh the lost joys of freeborn wretchedness like dog in manger thus he snarles and bites and curses what anothers taste delights while such examples before my eyes i see guard me ye powers from loss of liberty it is strange you britains whom no force can humble should court those chains at which youre sure to grumble but since alas it is fatal to the age i will even maintain my post upon the stage which for at once i would all mens hope prevent i will never leave though tempted with a settlement finis
