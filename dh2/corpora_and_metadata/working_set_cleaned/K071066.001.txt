life of mark akenside mark akenside an eminent poet and physician was born at newcastle upon tyne the  th nov      he was second son of mark akenside a substantial butcher of that town his mothers name was mary lumsden at the freeschool of newcastle young akenside received the first part of his education he was next committed to the care of mr wilson a dissenting clergyman who kept a private academy at newcastle  about the eighteenth year of his age our author was sent to the university of edinburgh in the view of qualifying himself for the duties of a presbyterian pastor his parents and relations in general being of the presbyterian sect mr akenside received some assistance from the funds which the english dissenters employ in educating young men of no opulent fortunes but his views as to the ministry altering he bent his studies toward physic and honestly repaid to his benefactors the money they had advanced for him which being contributed for a different purpose than promoting the study of physic he thought it dishonorable to retain whether in relinquishing his design of being a dissenting clergyman he also ceased to be a dissenter is not certainly known  akensides genius and taste for poetry displayed themselves early when at newcastle school and during his continuance at mr wilsons academy his pleasures of imagination with several other poems  said were first written by him at morpeth while upon a visit to his relations and before he went to the university of edinburgh where he also distinguished himself by his poetical compositions his ode on the winter solstice which is dated    0 was certainly composed at that place  after three years study at edinburgh mr akenside went      to leyden where on   th may      he took his degree of doctor in physic same year appeared his pleasures of imagination a poem which procured him some emolument and much reputation this poem was followed by an epistle to curio an acrimonious attack on the political conduct of william pulteney earl of bath whom he stigmatizes under the name of curio as the betrayer of his country also published in the      akenside dissatisfied with this performance altered it exceedingly he converted the epistle into an ode and reduced it to less than half the number of lines of which it originally consisted in the      he published his first collection of odes ten in number in      came out his ode to the earl of huntingdon and in      he attempted to rouse the national spirit by an ode to the country gentlemen of england few of his remaining poems were published separately excepting the ode to thomas edwards esquire which though written in      was not printed till the year      the rest of dr akensides poems which appeared in his lifetime were given at least for the most part in the sixth volume of dodsleys collection  soon after his return from leyden he commenced physician at northampton where dr stonehouse then practiced with reputation and success whilst here he carried on an amicable debate with dr doddridge concerning the opinions of the ancient philosophers with regard to a future state of rewards and punishments in which dr akenside supported the firm belief of cicero in particular in this great article of natural religion not meeting with sufficient encouragement at northampton or being ambitious of a larger field in which to display his talents he removed to hampstead where he resided upwards of two years and then finally fixed himself in london  at london he was well known as a poet but had still to force his way as a physician at first he had but little practice and would probably have been reduced to difficulties had not mr dyson his intimate friend generously allowed him  00 l a year which enabled him to make a proper appearance in the world in time the doctor acquired considerable reputation and practice and arrived at most of the honors incident to his profession he became a fellow of the royal society a physician to st thomass hospital was admitted by mandamus to the degree of doctor in physic in the university of cambridge and elected a fellow of the royal college of physicians in london and upon the settlement of the queens household was appointed one of the physicians to her majesty he perhaps might have still rose to a greater elevation of character had not his studies ended with his life by a putrid fever   d june    0 in the   th year of his age he was buried in the parish of st jamess westminster  dr akenside was much devoted to the study of ancient literature and was a great admirer of plato cicero and the best philosophers of antiquity his knowledge and taste in this respect are conspicuous in his poems and in the notes and illustrations which he has annexed to them that he had a sincere reverence for the great and fundamental principles of religion is apparent from numberless passages in his writings his high veneration for the supreme being his noble sentiments of the wisdom and benevolence of the divine providence and his zeal for the cause of virtue are conspicuous in all his poems his regard to the christian revelation and his solicitude to have it preserved in its native purity are displayed in the ode to the bishop of winchester his attachment to the cause of civil and religious liberty is a distinguished feature in the character of his poetical writings he embraces every occasion of displaying his ardour concerning this subject and two of his odes those to the earl of huntingdon and the bishop of winchester are directly consecrated to it  dr akenside is to be considered as a didactick and lyrick poet his chief work the pleasures of imagination was received with great applause and raised the authors reputation high in the poetical world pope on looking into the manuscript before publication is reported to have said that the author was no everyday writer mr cooper in his letters concerning taste speaks of akenside in the following strain of commendation for my part i am of opinion that there is now living a poet of as genuine a genius as this kingdom ever produced shakespeare alone excepted by poetical genius i do not mean the mere talent of making verses but that glorious enthusiasm of soul that fine phrensy in which the poets eye rolling glances from heaven to earth from earth to heaven as shakespeare feelingly describes it this alone is poetry aught else is a mechanical art of putting syllables harmonicusly together the gentleman i mean is dr akenside the worthy author of the pleasures of imagination the most beautiful didactick poem that ever adorned the english language on the other hand the late mr gray in a letter to mr wharton of old park near durham dated peterhouse   th april      masons  to edit of gray p     says you desire to know it seems what character the poem of your young friend dr akenside bears here i wonder that you ask the opinion of a nation where those who pretend to judge do not judge at all and the rest the wiser part wait to catch the judgment of the world immediately above them that is dicks and the rainbow coffeehouses your readier way would be to ask the ladies who keep the bars in those two theaters of criticism however to show you that i am a judge as well as my countrymen i will tell you though i have rather turned it over than read it pleasures of imagination but no matter no more have they that it seems to me above the middling and now and then for a little while rises even to the best particularly in description it is often obscure and even unintelligible and too much infected with the hutchinson jargon in short its great fault is that it was published at least nine years too early and so methinks in a few words a la mode du temple i have very prettily dispatched what perhaps may for several years have employed a very ingenious man worth fifty of myself  as these observations were hastily delivered in a private letter before the poem had been maturely examined we may be allowed say the writers of the biographia to think them too severe and to steer a middle course between mr gray and mr cooper the obscurity of the pleasures of imagination when read with attention will chiefly be found in the allegory of the second book which we freely confess we could never understand it might likewise have been better if the peculiar language of hutchinson or rather of shaftesbury had sometimes been omitted nevertheless we cannot but regard it as a noble and beautiful poem exhibiting many bright displays of genius and fancy and holding out sublime views of nature providence and morality we concur with mr gray in thinking it was published too early the author himself became afterward of the same sentiment he was convinced that the poem was defective in some respects and redundant in others that it wanted revision and correction says mr dyson his editor he was sufficiently sensible but so quick was the demand for several successive republications that in any of the intervals to have completed the whole of his corrections was utterly impossible and yet to have gone on from time to time in making farther improvements in every new edition would he thought have had the appearance at least of abusing the favor of the public he chose therefore to continue for some time reprinting it without alteration and to forbear publishing any corrections or improvements until he should be able at once to give them to the public complete and with this view he went on for several years to review and correct his poem at leisure till at length he found the task grow so much upon his hands that despairing of ever being able to execute if sufficiently to his own satisfction he abandoned the purpose of correcting and resolved to write the poem over anew upon a somewhat different and an enlarged plan  dr akenside did not live to finish the whole of his plan that part of it which is carried into execution occurs next in this edition and the reader may judge of the doctors intentions by having recourse to the general argument prefixed to the poem he designed at first to compromise the whole of his subject according to a new plan in four books but he afterward changed his purpose and determined to distribute the pleasures of imagination into a greater number of books how far his scheme would have carried him if he had lived to complete it is uncertain for at his death he had only finished the first and second books a considerable part of the third and the introduction to the fourth the first book of the improved work bears a nearer resemblance to the first book of the former editions than any of the rest do to each other there are nevertheless in this book a great number of corrections and alterations and several considerable additions dr akenside has introduced a tribute of respect and affection to his friend mr dyson he has referred the pleasures of imagination to two sources only greatness and beauty and not to three as he had heretofore done his delineation of beautiful objects is much enlarged and upon the whole the first book seems to have received no small degree of improvement the second book is very different from the second book of the preceding editions the difference indeed is so great that they cannot be compared together the author enters into a display of truth and its three classes matter of fact experimental or scientifical truth and universal truth he treats likewise of virtue as existing in the divine mind of human virtue of vice and its origin of ridicule and of the passions what he has said upon the subject of ridicule is greatly and advantageously reduced from what it was in the former copies the enumeration of the different sources of ridicule is left out and consequently somelines which had given offense to dr warburton the allegorical vision which heretofore constituted a principal part of the second book is likewise omitted the poetical character of the second book as it now stands is that it is correct moral and noble the third book is an episode in which solon the athenian lawgiver is the chief character and the design of it seems to be to show the great influence of poetry in enforcing the cause of liberty this part is entirely new and if it had been finished would have proved a beautiful addition to the poem it is greatly to be regretted that dr akenside did not live to complete his design nevertheless we should have been sorry to have had the original poem entirely superseded whatever may be its faults there is in it a certain brightness and brilliancy of imagination and a certain degree of enthusiasm which the doctor did not seem to have possessed in equal vigor in the latter part of his life years and an application to scientifick studies appear in some measure to have turned his mind from sound to things from fancy to the understanding  dr johnson in his life of akenside says of this poem it has undoubtedly a just claim to very particular notice as an example of great felicity of genius and uncommon amplitude of acquisitions of a young mind stored with images and much exercised in combining and comparing them of the altered work he adds he seems to have somewhat contracted his diffusion but i know not whether he has gained in closeness what he has lost in splendor  to the pleasures of imagination continue the authors of the biographia succeed two books of odes the first containing eighteen the second fifteen odes it was dr akensides intention if he had lived to have made each book consist of twenty odes those which had been formerly published are greatly altered and improved the doctors odes are not equal to the beautiful productions of mr gray nor perhaps to those of one or two living writers but still there is in them a noble vein of poetry united with manly sense and applied to excellent purposes this encomium cannot be extended to the whole of the odes without exception dr akenside does not always preserve the dignity of the lyrick muse he is defective in the pathetick even upon a subject which peculiarly required it and where it might have been most expected the death of his mistress we mean his ode to the evening star however his hymn to cheerfulness and his odes on leaving holland on lyrick poetry to the earl of huntingdon and on recovering from a sit of sickness justly entitle him to a place among the principal lyrick writers of this country  of his odes says dr johnson nothing favorable can be said  to examine such compositions singly cannot be required they have doubtless brighter and darker parts but when they are once found to be generally dull all further labor may be spared for to what use can the work be criticized that will not be read in this diversity of opinions the reader will determine for himself  dr akensides principal medical performance was   his dissertatio de dysenteria published in      which has been commended as an elegant specimen of latinity it was twice translated into english he also wrote   observations on the origin and use of the lymphatick vessels in animals   an account of a blow on the heart and its effects   oration anniversaria ex instituto harveii in theatro collegii regalis modicorum londinensis habita anno        observations on cancers   of the use of ipecacuanha in asthmas   a method of treating white swellings of the joints besides these he read at the college some practical observations made at st thomass hospital on the putrid erysipelas which he intended forth second volume of the medical transactions this paper he carried home with a design to correct it but it was not returned at the time of his death being appointed cronian lecturer he chose for his subject the history of the revival of learning and read three lectures on it before the college but from which he soon desisted it was supposed in disgust some one of the college having objected that he had chosen a subject foreign to the institution most of the above pieces were published in the philosophical and medical transactions  advertisement to the edition      this volume contains a complete collection of the poems of the late dr akenside either reprinted from the original editions or faithfully published from copies which had been prepared by himself for publication  that the principal poem should appear in so disadvantageous a state may require some explanation the first publication of it was at a very early part of the authors life that it wanted revision and correction he was sufficiently sensible but so quick was the demand for several successive republications that in any of the intervals to have completed the whole of his corrections was utterly impossible and yet to have gone on from time to time in making farther improvements in every new edition would he thought have had the appearance at least of abusing the favor of the public he chose therefore to continue for some time reprinting it without alteration and to forbear publishing any corrections or improvements until he should be able at once to give them to the public complete and with this view he went on for several years to review and correct his poem at leisure till at length he found the task grow so much upon his hands that despairing of ever being able to execute it sufficiently to his own satisfaction he abandoned the purpose of correcting and resolved to write the poem over anew upon a somewhat different and an enlarged plan and in the execution of this design he had made a considerable progress what reason there may be to regret that he did not live to execute the whole of it will best appear from the perusal of the plan itself as stated in the general argument and of the parts which he had executed and which are here published for the person the right hon jeremiah dyson by whom this advertisement was written to whom he entrusted the disposal of his papers would have thought himself wanting as well to the service of the public as to the fame of his friend if he had not produced as much of the work as appeared to have been prepared for publication in this light he considered the entire first and second books of which a few copies had been printed for the use only of the author and certain friends also a very considerable part of the third book which had been transcribed in order to its being printed in the same manner and to these is added the introduction to a subsequent book which in the manuscript is called the fourth and which appears to have been composed at the time when the author intended to comprise the whole in four books but which as he had afterward determined to distribute the poem into more books might perhaps more properly be called the last book and this is all that is executed of the new work which although it appeared to the editor too valuable even in its imperfect state to be withholden from the public yet he conceives takes in by much too small a part of the original poem to supply its place and to supersede the republication of it for which reason both the poems are inserted in this collection  of odes the author had designed to make up two books consisting of twenty odes each including the several odes which he had before published at different times  the hymn to the naiads is reprinted from the sixth volume of dodsleys miscellanies with a few corrections and the addition of some notes to the inscriptions taken from the same volume three new inscriptions are added the last of which is the only instance wherein a liberty has been taken of inserting any thing in this collection which did not appear to have been intended by the author for publication in the present edition a few pieces are added which are known to be genuine and which certainly are no discredit to their author  among whose papers no copy of this was found but it is printed from a copy which he had many years since given to the editor  the design there are certain powers in human nature which seem to hold a middle place between the organs of bodly sense and the faculties of moral perception they have been called by a very general name the powers of imagination like the external senses they relate to matter and motion and at the same time give the mind ideas analogous to those of moral approbation and dislike as they are the inlets of some of the most exquisite pleasures with which we are acquainted it has naturally happened that men of warm and sensible tempers have sought means to recall the delightful perceptions which they afford independent of the objects which originally produced them this gave rise to the imitative or designing arts some of which as painting and sculpture directly copy the external appearances which were admired in nature others as music and poetry bring them back to remembrance by signs universally established and understood  but these arts as they grew more correct and deliberate were of course led to extend their imitation beyond the peculiar objects of the imaginative powers especially poetry which making use of language a the instrument by which it imitates is consequently become an unlimited representative of every speci and mode of being yet as their intention was only to express the objects of imagination and as they still abound chiefly in ideas of that class they of cours retain their original character and all the differen pleasures which they excite are termed in general pleasures of imagination  the design of the following poem is to give a view of these in the largest acceptance of the term so that whatever our imagination feels from the agreeable appearances of nature and all the various entertainment we meet with either in poetry painting music or any of the elegant arts might be deducible from one or other of those principles in the constitution of the human mind which are here established and explained  in executing this general plan it was necessary first of all to distinguish the imagination from our other faculties and in the next place to characterize those original forms or properties of being about which it is conversant and which are by nature adapted to it as light is to the eyes or truth to the understanding these properties mr addison had reduced to the three general classes of greatness novelty and beauty and into these we may analyze every object however complex which properly speaking is delightful to the imagination but such an object may also include many other sources of pleasure and its beauty or novelty or grandeur will make a stronger impression by reason of this concurrence besides which the imitative arts especially poetry owe much of their effect to a similar exhibition of properties quite foreign to the imagination insomuch that in every line of the most applauded poems we meet with either ideas drawn from the external senses or truths discovered to the understanding or illustrations of contrivance and final causes or above all the rest with circumstances proper to awaken and engage the passions it was therefore necessary to enumerate and exemplify thse different species of pleasure especially that from the passions which as it is supreme in the noblest work of human genius so being in some particulars not a little surprising gave an opportunity to enliven the didactick turn of the poem by introducing an allegory to account for the appearance  after these parts of the subject which hold chiefly of admiration or naturally warm and interest the mind a pleasure of a very different nature that which arises from ridicule came next to be considered as this is the foundation of the comic manner in all the arts and has been but very imperfectly treated by moral writers it was thought proper to give it a particular illustration and to distinguish the general sources from which the ridicule of characters is derived here too a change of style became necessary such a one as might yet be consistent if possible with the general taste of composition in the serious parts of the subject nor is it an easy task to give any tolerable force to images of this kind without running either into the gigantick expressions of the mock heroic  the familiar and poetical raillery of professed satire neither of which would have been proper here  the materials of all imitation being thus laid open nothing now remained but to illustrate some particular pleasures which arise either from the relations of different objects one to another or from the nature of imitation itself of the first kind is that various and complicated resemblance existing between several parts of the material and immaterial worlds which is the foundation of metaphor and wit as it seems in a great measure to depend on the early association of our ideas and as this habit of associating is the source of many pleasures and pains in life and on that account bears a great share in the influence of poetry and the other arts it is therefore mentioned here and its effects described then follows a general account of the production of these elegant arts and of the secondary pleasure as it is called arising from the resemblance of their imitations to the original appearances of nature after which the work concludes with some reflections on the general conduct of the powers of imagination and on their natural and moral usefulness in life  concerning the manner or turn of composition which prevails in this piece little can be said with propriety by the author he had two models that ancient and simple one of the first grecian poets as it is refined by virgil in the georgicks and the familiar epistolary way of horace this latter has several advantages it admits of a greater variety of style it more readily engages the generality of readers as partaking more of the air of conversation and especially with the assistance of rhyme leads to a closer and more concise expression add to this the example of the most perfect of modern poets who has so happily applied this manner to the noblest parts of philosophy that the public taste is in a great measure formed to it alone yet after all the subject before us tending almost constantly to admiration and enthusiasm seemed rather to demand a more open pathetick and figured style this too appeared more natural as the authors aim was not so much to give formal precepts or enter into the way of direct argumentation as by exhibiting the most engaging prospects of nature to enlarge and harmonize the imagination and by that means insensibly dispose the minds of men to a similar taste and habit of thinking in religion morals and civil life it is on this account that he is so careful to point out the benevolent intention of the author of nature in every principle of the human constitution here insisted on and also to unite the moral excellencies of life in the same point of view with the mere external objects of good taste thus recommending them in common to our natural propensity for admiring what is beautiful and lovely the same views have also led him to introduce some sentiment which may perhaps be looked upon as not quite direct to the subject but since they bear an obvious relation to it the authority of virgil the faultless model of didactick poetry will best support him in the particular for the sentiments themselves he make no apology  the pleasures of imagination  epict apud arrian ii    book i the argument the subjet proposed difficulty of treating it poetically the ideas of the divine mind the origin of every quality

when aught unknown strikes the quick sense and wakes each active power to brisker measures witness the neglect of all familiar prospects though beheld      the neglect  of all familiar prospects etc it is here said that in consequence of the love of novelty objects which at first were highly delightful to the mind lose that sect by repeated attention to them but the instance of  is opposed to this observation for there objects at first distasteful are in time rendered entirely agreeable by repeated attention  the difficulty in this case will be removed if we consider that when objects at first agreeable lose that influence by frequently recurring the mind is wholly passive and the perception involuntary but habit on the other hand generally supposes choice and activity accompanying it so that the pleasure arises here not from the object but from the minds conscious determination of its own activity and consequently increases in proportion to the frequency of that determination  it will still be urged perhaps that a familiarity with disagreeable objects renders them at length acceptable even when there is no room for the mind to resolve or act at all in this case the appearance must be accounted for one of these ways  the pleasure from habit may be merely negative the object at first gave uneasiness this uneasiness gradually wears off as the object grows familiar and the mind finding it at last entirely removed reckons its situation really pleasureable compared with what it had experienced before  the dislike conceived of the object at first might be owing to prejudice or want of attention consequently the mind being necessitated to review it often may at length perceive its own mistake and be reconciled to what it had looked on with aversion in which case a sort of instinctive justice naturally leads it to make amends for the injury by running toward the other extreme of fondness and attachment  or lasly though the object itself should always continue disagreeable yet circumstances of pleasure or good fortune may occur along with it thus an association may arise in the mind and the object never be remembered without those pleasing circumstances attending it by which means the disagreeable impression which it at first occasioned will in time be quite obliterated    with transport once the fond attentive gaze of young astonishment the sober zeal of age commenting on prodigious things for such the bounteous providence of heaven in every breast implanting this desire   0  this desire  of objects new and sstrange etc these two ideas are often confounded though it is evident the mere novelty of an object makes it agreeable even where the mind is not affected with the least degree of wonder whereas wonder indeed always implies novelty being never excited by common or wellknown appearances but the pleasure in both cases is explicable from the same final cause the acquisition of knowledge and enlargement of our views of nature on this account it is natural to treat of them together  of objects new and strange to urge us on with unremitted labor to pursue those sacred stores that wait the ripening soul in truths exhaustless bosom what need words to paint its power for this the daring youth breaks from his weeping mothers anxious arms in foreign climes to rove the pensive sage heedless of sleep or midnights harmful damp

in zephyrs arms the blushing may moves onward or as venus when she stood effulgent on the pearly car and smiled fresh from the deep and conscious of her form to see the tritons tune their vocal shells

wisdoms garb to damp your tender hopes i do not mean to bid the jealous thundrer fire the heavens or shapes insernal rend the groaning earth to fright you from your joys my cheerful song with better omens calls you to the field pleased with your generous ardour in the chase and warm like you then tell me for ye know does beauty ever deign to dwell where health and active use are strangers is her charm confessed in aught whose most peculiar ends are lame and fruitless or did nature mean this pleasing call the herald of a lie to hide the shame of discord and disease and catch with fair hypocrisy the heart of idle faith o no with better cares the indulgent mother conscious how infirm her offspring tread the paths of good and ill by this illustrious image in each kind still most illustrious where the object holds its native powers most perfect she by this illumes the headstrong impulse of desire and sanctifies his choice the generous glebe whose bosom smiles with verdure the clear track of streams delicious to the thirsty soul the bloom of nectard fruitage ripe to sense and every charm of animated things are only pledges of a state sincere the integrity and order of their frame when all is well within and every end accomplished thus was beauty sent from heaven the lovely ministress of truth and good in this dark world for truth and good are one      truth and good are one  and beauty dweils in them etc do you imagine says socrates to aristippus that what is good is not beautiful have you not observed that these appearances always coincide virtue for instance in the same respect as to which we call it good is ever acknowledged to be beautiful also in the characters of men we always join the two denominations together this the athenians did in a peculiar manner by the words   the beauty of human bodies corresponds in like manner with that economy of parts which constitutes them good and in every circumstance of life the same object is constantly accounted both beautiful and good inasmuch as it answers the purposes for which it was designed xenoph memorab socrat lib iii cap    this excellent observation has been illustrated and extended by the noble restorer of ancient philosophy see the characteristicks vol ii p     and     and vol iii p     and another ingenious author has particularly shown that it holds in the general laws of nature in the works of art and the conduct of the sciences inquiry into the original of our ideas of beauty and virtue treat i sect   as to the connection between beauty and truth there are two opinions concerning it some philosophers assert an independent and invariable law in nature in consequence of which all rational beings must alike perceive beauty in some certain proportions and deformity in the contrary and this necessity being supposed the ame with that which commands the assent or dissent of the understanding it follows of course that beauty is founded on the universal and unchangeable law of truth  but others there are who believe beauty to be merely a relative and arbitrary thing that indeed it was a benevolent provision in nature to annex so delightful a sensation to those objects which are best and most perfect in themselves that so we might be engaged to the choice of them at once and without having to infer their usefulness from their structure and effects but that it is not impossible in a physical sense that two beings of equal capacities for truth should perceive one of them beauty and the other deformity in the same proportions and upon this supposition by that truth which is always connected with beauty nothing more can be meant than the conformity of any object to those proportions upon which after careful examination the beauty of that species is found to depend polycietus for instance a famous ancient sculptor from an accurate mensuration of the several parts of the most perfect human bodies deduced a canon or system of proportions which was the rule of all succeeding artists suppose a statue modelled according to this a man of mere natural taste upon looking at it without entering into its proportions confesses and admires its beauty whereas a professor of the art applies his measures to the head the neck or the hand and without attending to its beauty pronounces the workmanship to be just and true    and beauty dwells in them and they in her with like participation wherefore then o sons of earth would ye dissolve the tie o wherefore with a rash impetuous aim seek ye those flowery joys with which the hand of lavish fancy paints each flattering scene where beauty seems to dwell nor once inquire where is the sanction of eternal truth or where the seal of undeceitful good to save your search from folly wanting these lo beauty withers in your void embrace and with the glittering of an idiots toy did fancy mock your vows nor let the gleam of youthful hope that shines upon your hearts be chilled or clouded at this awful task to learn the lore of undeceitful good and truth eternal though the poisonous charms of baleful superstition guide the feet of servile numbers through a dreary way to their abode through deserts thorns and mire and leave the wretched pilgrim all forlorn to muse at last amid the ghostly gloom of graves and hoary vaults and cloistered cells to walk with specter through the midnight shade and to the screaming owls accursed song attune the dreadful workings of his heart yet be not ye dismayed a gentler star your lovely search illumines from the grove where wisdom talked with her athenian sons could my ambitious hand intwine a wreath of platos olive with the mantuan bay then should my powerful verse at once dispel those monkish horrors then in light divine disclose the elysian prospect where the steps of those whom nature charms through blooming walks through fragrant mountains and poetic streams amid the train of sages heroes bards led by their winged genius and the choir of laurelld science and harmonious art proceed exulting to the eternal shrine where truth conspicous with her sister twins the undivided partners of her sway with good and beauty reigns o let not us lulled by luxurious pleasures languid strain or crouching to the frowns of bigot rage o let us not a moment pause to join that godlike band and if the gracious power who first awakened my untutored song will to my invocation breathe anew the tuneful spirit then through all our paths never shall the sound of this devoted lyre be wanting whether on the rosy mead when summer smiles to warn the melting heart of luxurys allurement whether firm against the torrent and the stubborn hill to urge bold virtues unremitted nerve and wake the strong divinity of soul that conquers chance and fate or whether struck for sounds of triumph to proclaim her toils upon the lofty summit round her brow to twine the wreath of incorruptive praise to trace her hallowed light through future worlds and bless heavens image in the heart of man thus with a faithful aim have we presumed adventurous to delineate natures form whether in vast majestic pomp arrayed or dressed for pleasing wonder or serene in beautys rosy smile it now remains through various beings fair proportioned scale to trace the rising luster of her charms from their first twilight shining forth at length to full meridian splendor of degree the least and lowliest in the effusive warmth of colors mingling with a random blaze does beauty dwell then higher in the line and variation of determined shape where truths eternal measures mark the bound of circle cube or sphere the third ascent unites this varied symmetry of parts with colours bland allurement as the pearl shines in the concave of its azure bed and painted shells indent their speckled wreath then more attractive rise the blooming forms through which the breath of nature has infused her genial power to draw with pregnant veins nutricious moisture from the bounteous earth in fruit and seed prolisick thus the flowers their purple honors with the spring resume and such the stately tree which autumn bends with blushing treasures but more lovely still is natures charm where to the full consent of complicated members to the bloom of color and the vital change of growth lifes holy flame and piercing sense are given and active motion speaks the tempered soul so moves the bird of juno so the steed with rival ardour beats the dusty plain and faithful dogs with eager airs of joy salute their fellows thus does beauty dwell there most conspicous even in outward shape where dawns the high expression of a mind by steps conducting our enraptured search to that eternal origin whose power through all the unbounded symmetry of things like rays effulging from the parent sun this endless mixture of her charms diffused mind mind alone bear witness earth and heavnl the living fountains in itself contains of beauteous and sublime here hand in hand sit

or rhapodists who went about the courts of princes and noblemen entertaining them at festivals with music and poetry they attempted both the epick ode and satire and abounded in a wild and fantastic vein of fable partly allegorical and partly founded on traditionary legends of the saracen wars these were the rudiments of italian poetry but their taste and composition must have been extremely barbarous as we may judge by those who followed the turn of their fable in much politer times such as bolardo bernardo tasso ariosto etc  and wildly warbling scattered as they flew their blooming

was once the delight of the finest gentlemen of antiquity and their recreation after the hurry of public affairs from this condition it cannot be recovered but by uniting it once more with the works of imagination and we have had the pleasure of observing a very great progress made toward their union in england within these few years it is hardly possible to conceive them at a greater distance from each other than at the revolution when lock stood at the head of one party and dryden of the other but the general spirit of liberty which has ever since been growing naturally invited our men of wit and genius to improve that influence which the arts of persuasion gave them with the people by applying them to subjects of importance to society thus poetry and eloquence became considerable and philosophy is now of course obliged to borrow of their embellishments in order even to gain audience with the public  of mimick fancy and harmonious joy to priestly domination and the lust of lawless

beauty now the same glad task impends now urging our ambitious toil we hasten to recount the various springs of adventitious pleasure which adjoin their grateful influence to the prime effect of objects grand or beauteous and enlarge the complicated joy the sweets of sense do they not often with kind accession flow to raise harmonious fancys native charm so while we taste the fragrance of the rose glows not her blush the fairer while we view amid the noontide walk a limpid rill gush through the trickling herbage to the thirst of summer yielding the delicious draught of cool refreshment over the mossy brink shines not the surface clearer and the waves with sweeter music murmur as they flow nor this alone the various lot of life often from external circumstance assumes a moments disposition to rejoice in those delights which at a different hour would pass unheeded fair the face of spring when rural songs and odours wake the morn to every eye but how much more to his round whom the bed of sickness long diffused its melancholy gloom how doubly fair when first with freshborn vigor he inhales the balmy breeze and feels the blessed sun warm at his bosom from the springs of life chasing oppressive damps and languid pain or shall i mention where celestial truth her awful light discloses to bestow a more majestic pomp on beautys frame for man loves knowledge and the beams of truth more welcome touch his understandings eye than all the blandishments of sound his ear than all of taste his tongue nor ever yet the melting rainbows vernaltincturd hues to me have shone so pleasing as when first the hand of science pointed out the path in which the sunbeams gleaming from the west fall on the watery cloud whose darksome veil involves the orient and that trickling shower piercing through every crystalline unequal of clustring dewdrops to their flight opposed recoil at length where concave all behind the internal surface of each glassy orb repels their forward passage into air that thence direct they seek the radiant goal from which their course began and as they strike in different lines the gazers obvious eye assume a different luster through the bread of colors changing from the splendid rose to the pale violets dejected hue or shall we touch that kind access of joy that springs to each fair object while we trace through all its fabric wisdoms artful aim disposing every part and gaining still by means proportioned her benignant end speak ye the pure delight whose favored steps the lamp of science through the jealous maze of nature guides when happily you reveal her secret honors whether in the sky the beauteous laws of light the central powers that wheel the pensile planets round the year whether in wonders of the rolling deep or the rich fruits of allsustaining earth or fineadjusted springs of life and sense ye scan the counsels of their authors hand what when to raise the meditated scene the flame of passion through the struggling soul deepkindled shows across that sudden blaze the object of its rapture vast of size with fiercer colors and a night of shade what like a storm from their capacious bed the sounding seas oerwhelming when the might of these eruptions working from the depth of mans strong apprehension shakes his frame even to the base from every naked sense of pain or pleasure dissipating all opinions feeble covrings and the veil spun from the cobweb fashion of the times to hide the feeling heart then nature speaks her genuine language and the words of men big with the very motion of their souls declare with what accumulated force the impetuous nerve of passion urges on the native weight and energy of things ye more her honors where nor beauty claims nor shows of good the thirsty sense allure from passions power alone our nature holds     from passions power alone etc this very mysterious kind of pleasure which is often found in the exercise of passions generally counted painful has been taken notice of by several authors lucretius resolves it into selflove suave mari magno etc lib ii   as if a man was never pleased in being moved at the distress of a tragedy without a cool reflection that though these fictitious personages were so unhappy yet he himself was perfectly at ease and in safety the ingenious author of the reflections critiques sur la poesy et sur la peinture accounts for it by the general delight which the mind takes in its own activity and the abhorrence it feels of an indolent and inattentive state and this joined with the moral approbation of its own temper which attends these emotions when natural and just is certainly the true foundation of the pleasure which as it is the origin and basis of tragedy and epick deserved a very particular consideration in this poem  essential pleasure passions fierce illapse rouses the minds whole fabric with supplies of daily impulse keeps the elastick powers intensely poised and polishes anew by that collision all the fine machine else rust would rise and foulness by degrees incumbring choke at last what heaven designed for ceaseless motion and a round of toil  but say does every passion thus to man administer delight that name indeed becomes the rosy breath of love becomes the radiant smiles of joy the applauding hand of admiration but the bitter shower that sorrow sheds upon a brothers grave but the dumb palsy of nocturnal fear or those consuming fires that gnaw the heart of panting indignation find we there to move delight  then listen while my tongue the unaltered will of heaven with faithful awe reveals what old harmodius wont to teach my early age harmodius who had weighed within his learned mind whatever the schools of wisdom or thy lonelywhispring voice o faithful nature dictate of the laws which govern and support this mighty frame of universal being often the hours from morn to eve have stolen unmarked away while mute attention hung upon his lips as thus the sage his awful tale began it was in the windings of an ancient wood when spotless youth with solitude resigns to sweet philosophy the studious day what time pale autumn shades the silent eve musing roved of good and evil much and much of mortal man my thought revolved when starting full on fancys gushing eye the mournful image of parthenias fate that hour o long beloved and long deplored when blooming youth nor gentlest wisdoms arts nor hymens honors gathered for thy brow nor all thy lovers all thy fathers tears availed to snatch thee from the cruel grave thy agonizing looks thy last farewell struck to the inmost feeling of my soul as with the hand of death at once the shade more horrid nodded over me and the winds with hoarser murmuring shook the branchess dark as midnight storms the scene of human things appeared before me deserts burning sands where the parched adder dies the frozen south and desolation blasting all the west with rapine and with murder tyrant power here sits enthroned with blood the baleful charms of superstition there infect the skies and turn the sun to horror gracious heaven what is the life of man or cannot these not these portents thy awful will suffice that propagated thus beyond their scope they rise to act their cruelty anew in my afflicted bosom thus decreed the universal sensitive of pain the wretched heir of evils not its own thus i impatient when at once effusd a flashing torrent of celestial day burst through the shadowy void with slow descent a purple cloud came floating through the sky and poised at length within the circling trees hung obvious to my view till opening wide its lucid orb a more than human form emerging leaned majestic over my head and instant thunder shook the conscious grove then melted into air the liquid cloud and all the shining vision stood revealed a wreath of palm his ample forehead bound and over his shoulder mantling to his knee flowed the transparent robe around his waist collected with a radiant zone of gold ethereal there in mystic signs engraved i read his office high and sacred name genius of humankind appalled i gazed the godlike presence for athwart his brow displeasure tempered with a mild concern looked down reluctant on me and his words like distant thunders broke the murmuring air vain are thy thoughts o child of mortal birth and impotent thy tongue is thy short span capacious of this universal frame thy wisdom allsufficient thou alas do thou aspire to judge between the lord of nature and his works to lift thy voice against the sovran order he decreed all good and lovely to blaspheme the bands of tenderness innate and social love holiest of things by which the general orb of being as by adamantine links was drawn to perfect union and sustained from everlasting have thou felt the pangs of softening sorrow of indignant zeal so grievous to the soul as thence to wish the ties of nature broken from thy frame that so thy selfish unrelenting heart might cease to mourn its lot no longer then the wretched heir of evils not its own o fair benevolence of generous minds o man by nature formed for all mankind he spoke abashed and silent i remained as conscious of my tongues offense and awed before his presence though my secret soul disdained the imputation on the ground i fixed my eyes till from his airy couch he stooped sublime and touching with his hand my dazzling forehead raise thy sight he cried and let thy sense convince thy erring tongue i looked and lo the former scene was changed for verdant alleys and surrounding trees a solitary prospect wide and wild rushed on my senses twas an horrid pile of hills with many a shaggy forest mixed with many a sable cliff and glittering stream most recumbent over the hanging ridge the brown woods waved while evertrickling springs washed from the naked roots of oak and pine the crumbling soil and still at every fail down the steep windings of the channelld rock remurmring rushed the congregated floods with hoarser inundation till at last they reached a grassy plain which from the skirts of that high desert spread her verdant lap and drank the gushing moisture where confined in one smooth current over the lilied vale clearer than glass it flowed autumnal spoils luxuriant spreading to the rays of morn blushed over the cliffs whose halfencircling mound as in a sylvan theater enclosed that flowery level on the rivers brink i spied a fair pavilion which diffused its floating umbrage mid the silver shade of osiers now the western sun revealed between two parting cliffs his golden orb and poured across the shadow of the hills on rocks and floods a yellow stream of light that cheered the solemn scene my listening powers were awed and every thought in silence hung and wondering expectation then the voice of that celestial power the mystic show declaring thus my deep attention called inhabitant of earth to whom is given  0  inhabitant of earth etc the account of the nomy of providence here introduced as the most  and satisfy the mind when under the compunction  private evils seems to have come originally from the pythagorean school but of the ancient philosophers plato  largely insisted upon it has established it with all the  capacious understanding and ennobled it with  magnificence of his divine imagination he has one passage  full and clear on this head that i am persuaded the reader  be pleased to see it here though somewhat long addressing  self to such as are not satisfied concerning divine provide the being who presides over the whole says he posed and complicated all things for the happiness and tue of the whole every part of which according to the extent of its influence does and suffers what is fit and proper one of these parts is yours o unhappy man which  itself most inconsiderable and minute yet being connected with the universe ever seeks to cooperate with that supreme order you in the meantime are ignorant of the very end for which all particular natures are brought into existence that the allcomprehending nature of the whole may be perfect and happy existing as it does not for your sake but the cause and reason of your existence which as in the symmetry of every artificial work must of necessity con with the general design of the artist and be subservient to the whole of which it is a part your complaint therefore is ignorant and groundless since according to the v  energy of creation and the common laws of nature there a constant provision of that which is best at the same time for you and for the whole  for the governing intelligen clearly beholding all the actions of animated and ving creatures and that mixture of good and evil which  versifies them considered first of all by what disposition of things and by what situation of each individual in the general system vice might be depressed and subdued and virtue made secure of victory and happiness with the greatest facility and in the highest degree possible in this manner he ordered through the entire circle of being the internal constitution of every mind where should be its station in the universal fabric and through what variety of circumstances it should proceed in the whole tenor of its existence he goes on in his sublime manner to assert a future state of retribution as well for those who by the exercise of good dispositions being harmonized and assimilated into the divine virtue are consequently removed to a place of unblemished sanctity and happiness as of those who by the most flagitious arts have risen from contemptible beginnings to the greatest affluence and power and whom you therefore look upon as unanswerable instances of negligence in the gods because you are ignorant of the purposes to which they are subservient and in what manner they contribute to that supreme intention of good to the whole plato de leg x     this theory has been delivered of late especially abroad in a manner which subverts the freedom of human actions whereas plato appears very careful to preserve it and has been in that respect imitated by the best of his followers    the gracious ways of providence to learn receive my sayings with a steadfast ear  know then the sovran spirit of the world though selfcollected from eternal time within his own deep essence he beheld the bounds of true felicity complete yet by immense benignity inclined to spread around him that primeval joy which filled himself he raised his plastic arm and sounded through the hollow depth of space the strong creative mandate straight arose these heavenly orbs the glad abodes of life effusive kindled by his breath divine through endless forms of being each inhald from him its portion of the vital flame in measure such that from the wide complex of coexistent orders one might rise      one might rise  one order etc see the meditations of antoninus and the characteristicks passim  one order allinvolving and entire he too beholding in the sacred light of his essential reason all the shapes of swift contingence all successive ties of action propagated through the sum of possible existence he at once down the long series of eventful time so fixed the dates of being so disposed to every living soul of every kind the field of motion and the hour of rest that all conspired to his supreme design to universal good with full accord answring the mighty model he had chosen the best and fairest of unnumberd worlds     the best and fairest etc this opinion is so old that timaeus locrus calls the supreme being  the artificer of that which is best and represents him as resolving in the beginning to produce the most excellent work and as copying the world most exactly from his own intelligible and essential idea so that it yet remain as it was at first perfect in beauty and will never stand  need of any correction or improvement there can be no room for a caution here to understand the expressions not of any particular circumstances of human life separately considered but of the sum or universal system of life and being see also the vision at the end of the theodicee of leibnitz  that lay from everlasting in the store of his divine conceptions nor content by one exertion of creative power his goodness to reveal through every age through every moment up the track of time his parent hand with evernew increase of happiness and virtue has adorned the vast harmonious frame his parent hand from the mute shellfish gasping on the shore to men to angels to celestial minds for ever leads the generations on to higher scenes of being while supplied from day to day with his enlivening breath inferior orders in succession rise to sill the void below as flame ascends   0 as flame ascends etc this opinion though not held by plato nor any of the ancients is yet a very natural cousequence of his principles but the disquisition is too complex and extensive to be entered upon here  as bodies to their proper center move as the poised ocean to the attracting moon obedient swells and every headlong stream devolves its winding waters to the main so all things which have life aspire to god the sun of being boundless unimpaird center of souls nor does the faithful voice of nature cease to prompt their eager steps aright nor is the care of heaven withheld from granting to the task proportioned aid that in their stations all may persevere to climb the ascent of being and approach for ever nearer to the life divine that rocky pile thou see that verdant lawn fresh watered from the mountains let the scene paint in thy fancy the primeval seat of man and where the will supreme ordained his mansion that pavilion fair diffused along the shady brink in this recess to wear the appointed season of his youth till riper hours should open to his toil the high communion of superior minds of consecrated heroes and of gods nor did the sire omnipotent forget his tender bloom to cherish nor withheld celestial footsteps from his green abode often from the radiant honors of his throne he sent whom most he loved the sovran fair the effluence of his glory whom he placed before his eyes for ever to behold the goddess from whose inspiration flows the toil of patriots the delight of friends without whose work divine in heaven or earth naught lovely naught propitious comes to pass nor hope nor praise nor honor her the sire gave it in charge to reap the blooming mind the folded powers to open to direct the growth luxuriant of his young desires and from the laws of this majestic world to teach him what was good as thus the nymph her daily care attended by her side with constant steps her gay companion stayed the fair euphrosyne the gentle queen of smiles and graceful gladness and delights that cheer alike the hearts of mortal men and powers immortal see the shining pair behold where from his dwelling now disclosed they quit their youthful charge and seek the skies i looked and on the flowery turf there stood between two radiant forms a smiling youth whose tender cheeks displayed the vernal flower of beauty sweetest innocence illumd his bashful eyes and on his polished brow sat young simplicity with fond regard he viewed the associates as their steps they moved the younger chief his ardent eyes detained with mild regret invoking her return bright as the star of evening she appeared amid the dusky scene eternal youth over all her form its glowing honors breathed and smiles eternal from her candid eyes flowed like the dewy luster of the morn effusive trembling on the placid waves the spring of heaven had shed its blushing spoils to bind her sable tresses full diffused her yellow mantle floated in the breeze and in her hand she waved a living branch rich with immortal fruits of power to calm the wrathful heart and from the brightning eyes to chase the cloud of sadness more sublime the heavenly partner moved the prime of age composed her steps the presence of a god high on the circle of her brow enthroned from each majestic motion darted awe devoted awe till cherished by her looks benevolent and meek confiding love to filial rapture softened all the soul free in her graceful hand she poised the sword of chaste dominion an heroic crown displayed the old simplicity of pomp around her honored head a matrons robe white as the sunshine streams through vernal clouds her stately form invested hand in hand the immortal pair forsook the enameled green ascending slowly rays of limpid light gleamd round their path celestial sounds were heard and through the fragrant air ethereal dews distilled around them till at once the clouds disparting wide in midway sky withdrew their airy veil and left a bright expanse of empyrean flame where spent and drowned afflicted vision plunged in vain to scan what object it involved my feeble eyes endured not bending down to earth i stood with dumb attention soon a female voice as watery murmurs sweet or warbling shades with sacred invocation thus began father of gods and mortals whose right arm with reins eternal guides the moving heavens bend thy propitious ear behold wellpleasd i seek to finish thy divine decree with frequent steps i visit yonder seat of man thy offspring from the tender seeds of justice and of wisdom to evolve the latent honors of his generous frame till thy conducting hand shall raise his lot from earths dim scene to these ethereal walks the temple of thy glory but not me not my directing voice he often requires or hears delighted this enchanting maid the associate thou have given me her alone he loves o father absent her he craves and but for her glad presence ever joined rejoices not in mine that all my hopes this thy benignant purpose to fulfill i deem uncertain and my daily cares unfruitful all and vain unless by thee still farther aided in the work divine she ceased a voice more awful thus replied o thou in whom for ever i delight fairer than all the inhabitants of heaven best image of thy author far from thee be disappointment or distaste or blame who soon or late shall every work fulfill and no resistance find if man refuse to hearken to thy dictates or allured by meaner joys to any other power transfer the honors due to thee alone that joy which he pursues he never shall taste that power in whom delights never behold go then once more and happy be thy toil go then but let not this thy smiling friend partake thy footsteps in her stead behold with thee the son of nemesis i send the fiend abhorred whose vengeance takes account of sacred orders violated laws see where he calls thee burning to be gone fierce to exhaust the tempest of his wrath on yon devoted head but thou my child control his cruel phrensy and protect thy tender charge that when despair shall grasp his agonizing bosom he may learn then he may learn to love the gracious hand alone sufficient in the hour of ill to save his feeble spirit then confess thy genuine honors o excelling fair when all the plagues that wait the deadly will of this avenging demon all the storms of night infernal serve but to display the energy of thy superior charms with mildest awe triumphant over his rage and shining clearer in the horrid gloom here ceased that awful voice and soon i felt the cloudy curtain of refreshing eve was closed once more from that immortal fire sheltering my eyelids looking up i viewed a vast gigantick spectre striding on through murmuring thunders and a waste of clouds with dreadful action black as night his brow relentless frowns involved his savage limbs with sharp impatience violent he writhed as through convulsive anguish and his hand armed with a scorpion lash full often he raised in madness to his bosom while his eyes rained bitter tears and bellowing loud he shook the void with horror silent by his side the virgin came no discomposure stirred her features from the glooms which hung around no stain of darkness mingled with the beam of her divine effulgence now they stoop upon the river bank and now to hail his wonted guests with eager steps advanced the unsuspecting inmate of the shade as when a famished wolf that all night long had ranged the alpine snows by chance at morn sees from a cliff incumbent over the smoke of some lone village a neglected kid that strays along the wild for herb or spring down from the winding ridge he sweeps amain and thinks he tears him so with tenfold rage the monster sprung remorseless on his prey amazed the stripling stood with panting breast feebly he poured the lamentable wail of helpless consternation struck at once and rooted to the ground the queen beheld his terror and with looks of tenderest care advanced to save him soon the tyrant felt her awful power his keen tempestous arm hung nerveless nor descended where his rage had aimed the deadly blow then dumb retired with sullen rancour lo the sovran maid folds with a mothers arms the fainting boy till life rekindles in his rosy cheek then grasps his hands and cheers him with her tongue o wake thee rouse thy spirit shall the spite of yon tormentor thus appal thy heart while i thy friend and guardian am at hand to rescue and to heal o let thy soul remember what the will of heaven ordains is ever good for all and if for all then good for thee nor only by the warmth and soothing sunshine of delightful things do minds grow up and flourish often misled by that bland light the young unpracticed views of reason wander through a fatal road far from their native aim as if to lie inglorious in the fragrant shade and wait the soft access of evercircling joys were all the end of being ask thyself this pleasing error did it never lull thy wishes has thy constant heart refused the silken fetters of delicious ease or when divine euphrosyne appeared within this dwelling did not thy desires hang far below the measure of thy fate which i revealed before thee and thy eyes impatient of my counsels turn away to drink the soft effusion of her smiles know then for this the everlasting sire deprives thee of her presence and instead o wise and still benevolent ordains this horrid visage hither to pursue my steps that so thy nature may discern its real good and what alone can save thy feeble spirit in this hour of ill from folly and despair o yet beloved let not this headlong terror quite overwhelm thy scattered powers nor fatal deem the rage of this tormentor nor his proud assault while i am here to vindicate thy toil above the generous question of thy arm brave by thy fears and in thy weakness strong this hour he triumphs but confront his might and dare him to the combat then with ease disarmed and quelled his fierceness he resigns to bondage and to scorn while thus inured by watchful danger by unceasing toil the immortal mind superior to his fate amid the outrage of external things firm as the solid base of this great world rests on his own foundations blow ye winds ye waves ye thunders roll your tempest on shake ye old pillars of the marble sky till all its orbs and all its worlds of fire be loosened from their seats yet still serene the unconquered mind looks down upon the wreck and ever stronger as the storms advance firm through the closing ruin holds his way where nature calls him to the destined goal so spoke the goddess while through all her frame celestial raptures lowd in every word in every motion kindling warmth divine to seize who listened vehement and swift as lightning fires the aromatic shade in ethiopian fields the stripling felt her inspiration catch his fervid soul and starting from his languor thus exclaimed then let the trial come and witness thou if terror be upon me if i shrink to meet the storm or faulter in my strength when hardest it besets me do not think that i am fearful and infirm of soul as late thy eyes beheld for thou have changed my nature thy commanding voice has waked my languid powers to bear me boldly on wherever the will divine my path ordains through toil or peril only do not thou forsake me o be thou for ever near that i may listen to thy sacred voice and guide by thy decrees my constant feet but say for ever are my eyes beret say shall the fair euphrosyne not once appear again to charm me thou in heaven o thou eternal arbiter of things be thy great bidding done for who am i to question thy appointment let the frowns of this avenger every morn overcast the cheerful dawn and every evening damp with double night my dwelling i will learn to hail them both and unrepining bear his hateful presence but permit my tongue one glad request and if my deeds may find thy awful eye propitious o restore the rosyfeaturd maid again to cheer this lonely eat and bless me with her smiles he spoke when instant through the sable glooms with which that furious presence had involved the ambient air a flood of radiance came swift as the lightning flash the melting clouds flew diverse and amid the blue serene euphrosyne appeared with sprightly step the nymph alighted on the irrigous lawn and to her wondering audience thus began lo i am here to answer to your vows and be the meeting fortunate i come with joyful tidings we shall part no more  hark how the gentle echo from her cell talks through the cliffs and murmuring over the stream repeats the accents we shall part no more o my delightful friends wellpleasd on high the father has beheld you while the might of that stern foe with bitter trial proved your equal doings then for ever spoke the high decree that thou celestial maid however that grisly phantom on thy steps may sometimes dare intrude yet never more shall thou descending to the abode of man alone endure the rancour of his arm or leave thy loved euphrosyne behind she ended and the whole romantic scene immediate vanished rocks and woods and rills the mantling tent and each mysterious form flew like the pictures of a morning dream when sunshine fills the bed a while i stood perplexed and giddy till the radiant power who bad the visionary landscape rise as up to him i turned with gentlest looks preventing my inquiry thus began there let thy soul acknowledge its complaint how blind how impious there behold the ways of heavens eternal destiny to man for ever just benevolent and wise that virtues awful steps however pursued by vexing fortune and intrusive pain should never be divided from her chaste her fair attendant pleasure need i urge thy tardy thought through all the various round of this existence that thy softening soul at length may learn what energy the hand of virtue mingles in the bitter tide of passion swelling with distress and pain to mitigate the sharp with gracious drops of cordial pleasure ask the faithful youth why the cold urn of her whom long he loved so often fills his arms so often draws his lonely footsteps at the silent hour to pay the mournful tribute of his tears o he will tell thee that the wealth of worlds should never seduce his bosom to forego that sacred hour when stealing from the noise of care and envy sweet remembrance sooths with virtues kindest looks his aching breast and turns his tears to rapture  ask the crowd which flies impatient from the village walk to climb the neighboring cliffs when far below the cruel winds have hurled upon the coast some helpless bark while sacred pity melts the general eye or terrours icy hand smites their distorted limbs and horrent hair while every mother closer to her breast catches her child and pointing where the waves foam through the shattered vessel shrieks aloud as one poor wretch that spreads his piteous arms for succor swallowed by the roaring surge as now another dashed against the rock drops lifeless down o deemst thou indeed no kind endearment here by nature given to mutual terror and compassions tears no sweetly melting softness which attracts over all that edge of pain the social powers to this their proper action and their end ask thy own heart when at the midnight hour slow through that studious gloom thy pausing eye led by the glimmering taper moves around the sacred volumes of the dead the songs of grecian bards and records writ by fame for grecian heroes where the present power of heaven and earth surveys the immortal page even as a father blessing while he reads the praises of his son if then thy soul spurning the yoke of these inglorious days mix in their deeds and kindle with their flame say when the prospect blackens on thy view when rooted from the base heroic states mourn in the dust and tremble at the frown of cursed ambition when the pious band of youths who fought for freedom and their sires  side by side in gore when ruian pride usurps the throne of justice turns the pomp of public power the majesty of rule the sword the laurel and the purple robe to slavish empty pageants to adorn a tyrants walk and glitter in the eyes of such as bow the knee when honored urns of patriots and of chiefs the awful bust and storyd arch to glut the cowardrage of regal envy strew the public way with hallowed ruins when the muses haunt the marble porch where wisdom wont to talk with socrates or tully hears no more save the hoarse jargon of contentious monks or female superstitions midnight prayer when ruthless rapine from the hand of time tears the destroying sith with surer blow to sweep the works of glory from their base till desolation over the grassgrown street expands his raven wings and up the wall where senates once the price of monarchs doomed hisses the gliding snake through hoary weeds that clasp the mouldering column thus defaced thus widely mournful when the prospect thrills thy beating bosom when the patriots tear starts from thine eye and thy extended arm in fancy hurls the thunderbolt of jove to fire the impious wreath on philips brow     philip the macedonian  or dash octavius from the trophyd car say does thy secret soul repine to taste the big distress or would thou then exchange those heartennobling sorrows for the lot of him who sits amid the gaudy herd of mute barbarians bending to his nod and bears alost his goldinvested front and says within himself i am a king and wherefore should the clamorous voice of woe intrude upon mine ear

from false representations of the fancy producing false opinions concerning good and evil inquiry into ridicule the general sources of ridicule in the minds and characters of men enumerated final cause of the sense of ridicule the resemblance of certain aspects of inanimate things to the sensations and properties of the mind the operations of the mind in the production of the works of imagination described the secondary pleasure from imitation the benevolent order of the world illustrated in the arbitrary connection of these pleasures with the objects which excite them the nature and conduct of taste concluding with an account of the natural and moral advantages resulting from a sensible and wellformed imagination  what wonder therefore since the endearing ties of passion link the universal kind of man so close what wonder if to search this common nature through the various change of sex and age and fortune and the frame of each peculiar draw the busy mind with unresisted charms the spacious west and all the teeming regions of the south hold not a quarry to the curious flight of knowledge half so tempting or so fair as man to man nor only where the smiles of love invite nor only where the applause of cordial honor turns the attentive eye on virtues graceful deeds for since the course of things external acts in different ways on human apprehensions as the hand of nature tempered to a different frame peculiar minds so happily where the powers     where the powers  of fancy etc the influence of the imagination on the conduct of life is one of the most important points in moral philosophy it were easy by an induction of facts to prove that the imagination directs almost all the passions and mixes with almost everycircumstance of action or pleasure let any man even of the coldest head and soberest industry analyze the idea of what he calls his interest he will find that it consists chiefly of certain degrees of decency beauty and order variously combined into one system the idol which he seeks to enjoy by labor hazard and selfdenial it is on this account of the last consequence to regulate these images by the standard of nature and the general good otherwise the imagination by heightening some objects beyond their real excellence and beauty or by representing others in a more odious or terrible shape than they deserve may of course engage us in pursuits utterly inconsistent with the moral order of things  if it be objected that this account of things supposes the passions to be merely accidental whereas there appears in some a natural and hereditary disposition to certain passions prior to all circumstances of education or fortune it may be answered that though no man is born ambitious or a miser yet he may inherit from his parents a peculiar temper or complexion of mind which shall render his imagination more liable to be struck with some particular objects consequently dispose him to form opinions of good and ill and entertain passions of a particular turn some men for instance by the original frame of their minds are more delighted with the vast and magnificent others on the contrary with the elegant and gentle aspects of nature and it is very remarkable that the disposition of the moral powers is always similar to this of the imagination that those who are most inclined to admire prodigious and sublime objects in the physical world are also most inclined to applaud examples of fortitude and heroic virtue in the moral while those who are charmed rather with the delicacy and sweetness of colors and forms and sounds never fail in like manner to yield the preference to the softer scenes of virtue and the sympathies of a domestic life and this is sufficient to account for the objection  among the ancient philosophers though we have several hints concerning this influence of the imagination upon morals among the remains of the socratick school yet the stoics were the first who paid it a due attention zeno their founder thought it impossible to preserve any tolerable regularity in life without frequently inspecting those pictures or appearances of things which the imagination offers to the mind diog laert l vii the meditations of m aurelius and the discourses of epictetus are full of the same sentiment insomuch that the latter makes the  or right management of the fancies the only thing for which we are accountable to providence and without which a man is no other than stupid or frantic arrian l i c    and l ii c    see also the characteristicks vol i from p     to     where this stoical doctrine is embellished with all the elegance and graces of plato    of fancy neither lessen nor enlarge the images of things but paint in all their genuine hues the features which they wore in nature there opinion will be true and action right for action treads the path in which opinion says he follows good or flies from evil and opinion gives report of good or evil as the scene was drawn by fancy lovely or deformed thus her report can never there be true where fancy cheats the intellectual eye with glaring colors and distorted lines is there a man who at the sound of death sees ghastly shapes of terror conjured up and black before him naught but deathbed groans and fearful prayers and plunging from the brink of light and being down the gloomy air an unknown depth alas in such a mind if no bright forms of excellence attend the image of his country nor the pomp of sacred senates nor the guardian voice of justice on her throne nor aught that wakes the conscious bosom with a patriots flame will not opinion tell him that to die or stand the hazard is a greater ill than to betray his country and in act will he not choose to be a wretch and live here vice begins then from the enchanting cup which fancy holds to all the unwary thirst of youth often swallows a circean draught that sheds a baleful tincture over the eye of reason till no longer he discerns and only guides to err then revel forth a furious band that spurn him from the throne and all is uproar thus ambition grasps the empire of the soul thus pale revenge unsheaths her murderous dagger and the hands of lust and rapine with unholy arts watch to oerturn the barrier of the laws that keeps them from their prey thus all the plagues the wicked bear or over the trembling scene the tragic muse discloses under shapes of honor safety pleasure ease or pomp stole first into the mind yet not by all those lying forms which fancy in the brain engenders are the kindling passions driven to guilty deeds nor reason bound in chains that vice alone may lord it often adorned with solemn pageants folly mounts the throne and plays her idiot anticks like a queen a thousand garbs she wears a thousand ways she wheels her giddy empire  lo thus far with bold adventure to the mantuan lyre i sing of natures charms and touch wellpleasd a stricter note now happily must my song unbend her serious measure and reveal in lighter strains how follys awkward arts     how follys awkward arts etc notwithstanding the general influence of ridicule on private and civil life as well as on learning and the sciences it has been almost constantly neglected or misrepresented by divines especially the manner of treating these subjects in the science of human nature should be precisely the same as in natural philosophy from particular facts to investigate the stated order in which they appear and then apply the general law thus discovered to the explication of other appearances and the improvement of useful arts  excite impetuous laughters gay rebuke the sportive province of the comic muse see in what crowds the uncouth forms advance each would outstrip the other each prevent our careful search and offer to your gaze unasked his motley features wait a while my curious friends and let us first arrange in proper order your promiscous throng behold the foremost band of slender thought    behold the foremost band etc the first and most general source of ridicule in the characters of men is vanity or selfapplause for some desirable quality or possession which evidently does not belong to those who assume it  and easy faith whom flattering fancy sooths with lying specter in themselves to view illustrious forms of excellence and good that scorn the mansion with exulting hearts they spread their spurious treasures to the sun and bid the world admire but chief the glance of wishful envy draws their joybright eyes and lifts with selfapplause each lordly brow in number boundless as the blooms of spring behold their glaring idols empty shades by fancy gilded over and then set up for adoration some in learnings garb with formal band and sablecincturd gown and rags of moldy volumes some elate with martial splendor steely pikes and swords of costly frame and gay phoenician robes inwrought with flowery gold assume the port of stately valor listening by his side there stands a female form to her with looks of earnest import pregnant with amaze he talks of deadly deeds of breaches storms and sulfurous mines and ambush then at once breaks off and smiles to see her look so pale and asks some wondering question of her fears others of graver mien behold adorned with holy ensigns how sublime they move and bending often their sanctimonious eyes take homage of the simpleminded throng ambassadors of heaven nor much unlike is he whose visage in the lazy mist that mantles every feature hides a brood of politic conceits of whispers nods and hints deep omend with unwieldy schemes and dark portents of state ten thousand more prodigious habits and tumultous tongues pour dauntless in and swell the boastful band then comes the second order all who seek     then comes the second order etc ridicule from the same vanity where though the possession be real yet no merit can arise from it because of some particular circumstances which though obvious to the spectator are yet overlooked by the ridiculous character  the debt of praise where watchful unbelief darts through the thin pretense her squinting eye on some retired appearance which belies the boasted virtue or annuls the applause that justice else would pay here side by side i see two leaders of the solemn train approaching one a female old and gray with eyes demure and wrinklefurrowd brow

her cautious heart such is her terror at the risks of love and mans seducing tongue the other seems a bearded sage ungentle in his mien and sordid all his habit peevish want grins at his heels while down the gazing throng he stalks resounding in magnisick praise the vanity of riches the contempt of pomp and power be prudent in your zeal ye grave associates let the silent grace of her who blushes at the fond regard her charms inspire more eloquent unfold the praise of spotless honor let the man whose eye regards not his illustrious pomp and ample store but as indulgent streams to cheer the barren soil and spread the fruits of joy let him by juster measures fix the price of riches and the end of power another tribe succeeds deluded long     another tribe suceeds etc ridicule from a notion of exence in particular objects disproportioned to their intrinsic value and inconsistent with the order of nature  by fancys dazzling optics these behold the images of some peculiar things with brighter hues resplendent and portrayd with features nobler far than ever adorned their genuine objects hence the feverd heart pants with delirious hope for tinsel charms hence often obtrusive on

train through every scene of ridicule in things to lead the tenor of my devious lay through every swift occasion which the hand of laughter points at when the mirthful sting distends her sallying nerves and chokes her tongue what were it but to count each crystal drop which mornings dewy fingers on the blooms of may distill suffice it to have said      suffice it to have said etc by comparing these general sources of ridicule with each other and examining the ridiculous in other objects we may obtain a general detion of it equally applicable to every species the most important circumstance of this deition is laid down in the lines referred to but others more minute we shall subjoin here aristotles account of the matter seems both imperfect and false  says he  the ridiculous is some certain fault or turpitude without pain and not destructive to its subject poet c   for allowing it to be true as it is not that the ridiculous is never accompanied with pain yet we might produce many instances of such a fault or turpitude which cannot with any tolerable propriety be called ridiculous so that the definition does not distinguish the thing designed nay farther even when we perceive the turpitude tending to the destruction of its subject we may still be sensible of a ridiculous appearance till the ruin become imminent and the keener sensations of pity or terror banish the ludicrous apprehension from our minds for the sensation of ridicule is not a bare perception of the agreement or disagreement of ideas but a passion or emotion of the mind consequential to that perception so that the mind may perceive the agreement or disagreement and yet not feel the ridiculous because it is engrossed by a more violent emotion thus it happens that some men think those objects ridiculous to which others cannot endure to apply the name because in them they excite a much intenser and more important feeling and this difference among other causes has brought a good deal of confusion into this question  that which makes objects ridiculous is some ground of admiration or esteem connected with other more general circumstances comparatively worthless or deformed or it is some circumstance of turpitude or deformity connected with what is in general excellent or beautiful the inconsistent properties existing either in the objects themselves or in the apprehension of the person to whom they relate belonging always to the same order or class of being implying sentiment or design and exciting no acute or vehement emotion of the heart  to prove the several parts of this definition the appearance of excellence or beauty connected with a general condition comparatively sordid or deformed is ridiculous for instance pompous pretensions of wisdom joined with ignorance or folly in the socrates of aristophanes and the ostentations of military glory with cowardice and stupidity in the thraso of terence  the appearance of deformity or turpitude in conjunction with what is in general excellent or venerable is also ridiculous for instance the personal weaknesses of a magistrate appearing in the solemn and public functions of his station  the incongruous properties may either exist in the objects themselves or in the apprehension of the person to whom they relate in the last mentioned instance they both exist in the objects in the instances from aristophanes and terence one of them is objective and real the other only ounded in the apprehension of the ridiculous character  the inconsistent properties must belong to the same order or class of being a coxcomb in fine clothes bedaubed by accident in foul weather is a ridiculous object because his general apprehension of excellence and esteem is referred to the splendor and expense of his dress a man of sense and merit in the same circumstances is not counted ridiculous because the general ground of excellence and esteem in him is both in fact and in his own apprehension of a very different species  every ridiculous object implies sentiment or design a column placed by an architect without a capital or base is laughed at the same column in a ruin causes a very different sensation  and lastly the occurrence must excite no acute or vehement emotion of the heart such as terror pity or indignation for in that case as was observed above the mind is not at leisure to contemplate the ridiculous  whether any appearance not ridiculous be involved in this description and whether it comprehend every species and form of the ridiculous must be determined by repeated applications of it to particular instances    wherever the power of ridicule displays her quainteyd visage some incongrous form some stubborn dissonance of things combined strikes on the quick observer whether pomp or praise or beauty mix their partial claim where sordid fashions where ignoble deeds where foul deformity are wont to dwell or whether these with violation loathed invade resplendent pomps imperious mien the charms of beauty or the boast of praise ask we for what fair end the almighty sire     ask we for what fair end etc since it is beyond all contradiction evident that we have a natural sense or feeling of the ridiculous and since so good a reason may be assigned to justify the supreme being for bestowing it one cannot without astonishment reflect on the conduct of those men who imagine it is for the service of true religion to vilify and blacken it without distinction and endeavor to persuade us that it is never applied but in a bad cause ridicule is not concerned with mere speculative truth or falsehood it is not in abstract propositions or theorems but in actions and passions good and evil beauty and deformity that we find materials for it and all these terms are relative implying approbation or blame to ask them whether ridicule be a test of truth is in other words to ask whether that which is ridiculous can be morally true can be just and becoming or whether that which is just and becoming can be ridiculous a question that does not deserve a serious answer for it is most evident that as in a metaphysical proposition offered to the understanding for its assent the faculty of reason examines the terms of the proposition and finding one idea which was supposed equal to another to be in fact unequal of consequence rejects the proposition as a falsehood so in objects offered to the mind for its esteem or applause the faculty of ridicule finding an incongruity in the claim urges the mind to reject it with laughter and contempt when therefore we observe such a claim obtruded upon mankind and the inconsistent circumstances carefully concealed from the eye of the public it is our business if the matter be of importance to society to drag out those latent circumstances and by setting them in full view to convince the world how ridiculous the claim is and thus a double advantage is gained for we both detect the moral falsehood sooner than in the way of speculative inquiry and impress the minds of men with a stronger sense of the vanity and error of its authors and this and no more is meant by the application of ridicule  but it is said the practice is dangerous and may be inconsistent with the regard we owe to objects of real dignity and excellence i answer the practice fairly managed can never be dangerous men may be dishonest in obtruding circumstances foreign to the object and we may be inadvertent in allowing those circumstances to impose upon us but the sense of ridicule always judges right the socrates of aristophanes is as truly ridiculous a character as ever was drawn  true but it is not the character of socrates the divine moralist and father of ancient wisdom what then did the ridicule of the poet hinder the philosopher from detecting and disclaiming those foreign circumstances which he had falsely introduced into his character and thus rendered the sat doubly ridiculous in his turn no but it nevertheless had an ill influence on the minds of the people and so has the reasoning of spinoza made many atheists he has founded it indeed on suppositions utterly false but allow him these and his conclusions are unavoidably true and if we must reject the use of ridicule because by the imposition of false circumstances things may be made to seem ridiculous which are not so in themselves why we ought not in the same manner to reject the use of reason because by proceeding on false principles conclusions will appear true which are impossible in nature let the vehement and obstinate declaimers against ridicule determine    in mortal bosoms wakes this gay contempt these grateful stings of laughter from disgust educing pleasure wherefore but to aid the tardy steps of reason and at once by this prompt impulse urge us to depress the giddy aims of folly though the light of truth slow dawning on the inquiring mind at length unfolds through many a subtle tie how these uncouth disorders end at last in public evil yet benignant heaven conscious how dim the dawn of truth appears to thousands conscious what a scanty pause from labors and from care the wider lot of humble life affords for studious thought to scan the maze of nature therefore ampd the glaring scenes with characters of scorn as broad as obvious to the passing clown as to the lettered sages curious eye such are the various aspects of the mind  some heavenly genius whose unclouded thoughts attain that secret harmony which blends the ethereal spirit with its mould of clay o teach me to reveal the grateful charm that searchless nature over the sense of man diffuses to behold in lifeless things the inexpressive semblance of himself     the inexpressive semblance etc this similitude is the foundation of almost all the ornaments of poetic diction  of thought and passion mark the sable woods that shade sublime yon mountains nodding brow with what religious awe the solemn scene commands your steps as if the reverend form of minos or of numa should forsake the elysian seats and down the embowring glade move to your pausing eye behold the expanse of yon gay landscape where the silver clouds flit over the heavens before the sprightly breeze now their gray cincture skirts the doubtful sun now streams of splendor through their opening veil effulgent sweep from off the gilded lawn the aerial shadows on the curling brook and on the shady margins quivering leaves with quickest luster glancing while you view the prospect say within your cheerful breast plays not the lively sense of winning mirth with clouds and sunshine checkered while the round of social converse to the inspiring tongue of some gay nymph amid her subject train moves all obsequious whence is this effect this kindred power of such discordant things or flows their semblance from that mystic tone to which the newborn minds harmonious powers at first were strung or rather from the links which artful custom twines around her frame for when the different images of things by chance combined have struck the attentive soul with deeper impulse or connected long have drawn her frequent eye however distinct the external scenes yet often the ideas gain from that conjunction an eternal tie and sympathy unbroken let the mind recall one partner of the various league immediate lo the firm confedrates rise and each his former station straight resumes one movement governs the consenting throng and all at once with rosy pleasure shine or all are saddend with the glooms of care twas thus if ancient fame the truth unfold two faithful needles from the informing touch     two faithful needles etc see the elegant poem recited by cardinal bembo in the character of lucretius  vi    c v  of the same parentstone together drew its mystic virtue and at first conspired with fatal impulse quivering to the pole then though disjoined by kingdoms though the main rolled its broad surge betwixt and different stars beheld their wakeful motions yet preserved the former friendship and remembered still the alliance of their birth whatever the line which one possessed nor pause nor quiet knew the sure associate ere with trembling speed he four d its path and fixed unerring there such is the secret union when we feel a song a flower a name at once restore those longconnected scenes where first they moved the attention backward through her mazy walks guiding the wanton fancy to her scope to temples courts or fields with all the band of painted forms of passions and designs attendant whence if pleasing in itself the prospect from that sweet accession gains redoubled influence over the listening mind by these mysterious ties the busy power     by these mysterious ties etc the act of remembering seems almost wholly to depend on the association of ideas  of memory her ideal train preserves entire or when they would elude her watch reclaims their fleeting footsteps from the waste of dark oblivion thus collecting all the various forms of being to present before the curious aim of mimick art their largest choice like springs unfolded blooms exhaling sweetness that the skilful be may taste at will from their selected spoils to work her dulcet food for not the expanse of living lakes in summers noontide calm reflects the bordring shade and sunbright heavens with fairer semblance not the sculptured gold more faithful keeps the gravers lively trace than he whose birth the sister powers of art propitious viewed and from his genial star shed influence to the seeds of fancy kind than his attemperd bosom must preserve the seal of nature there alone unchanged her form remains the balmy walks of may there breathe perennial sweets the trembling chord resounds for ever in the abstracted ear melodious and the virgins radiant eye superior to disease to grief and time shines with unbating luster thus at length endowed with all that nature can bestow the child of fancy often in silence bends over these mixed treasures of his pregnant breast with conscious pride from them he often resolves to frame he knows not what excelling things and win he knows not what sublime reward of praise and wonder by degrees the mind feels her young nerves dilate the plastic powers labor for action blind emotions heave his bosom and with loveliest frenzy caught from earth to heaven he rowls his daring eye from heaven to earth anon ten thousand shapes like specter trooping to the wizards call flit swift before him from the womb of earth from oceans bed they come the eternal heavens disclose their splendours and the dark abyss pours out her births unknown with fixed gaze he marks the rising phantoms now compares their different forms now blends them now divides enlarges and extenuates by turns opposes ranges in fantastic bands and infinitely varies hither now now thither fluctuates his inconstant aim with endless choice perplexed at length his plan begins to open lucid order dawns and as from chaos old the jarring seeds of nature at the voice divine repaired each to its place till rosy earth unveiled her fragrant bosom and the joyful sun sprung up the blue serene by swift degrees thus disentangled his entire design emerges colors mingle features join and lines converge the fainter parts retire the fairer eminent in light advance and every image on its neighbor smiles a while he stands and with a fathers joy contemplates then with promethean art into its proper vehicle he breathes     into its proper vehicle etc this relates to the different sorts of corporeal mediums by which the ideas of the artists are rendered palpable to the senses as by sounds in music by lines and shadows in painting by diction in poetry etc  the fair conception which imbodyd thus and permanent becomes to eyes or ears an object ascertained while thus informed the various organs of his mimick skill the consonance of sounds the featured rock the shadowy picture and impassioned verse beyond their proper powers attract the soul by that expressive semblance while in sight of natures great original we scan the lively child of art while line by line and feature after feature we refer to that sublime exemplar whence it stole those animating charms thus beautys palm betwixt them wavering hangs applauding love doubts where to choose and mortal man aspires to tempt creative praise as when a cloud of gathering hail with limpid crusts of ice enclosed and obvious to the beaming sun collects his large effulgence straight the heavens with equal flames present on either hand the radiant visage persia stands at gaze appalled and on the brink of ganges doubts the snowy vested seer in mithras name to which the fragrance of the south shall burn to which his warbled orisons ascend such various bliss the welltund heart enjoys favored of heaven while plunged in sordid cares the unfeeling vulgar mocks the boon divine and harsh austerity from whose rebuke young love and smiling wonder shrink away abashed and chill of heart with sager frowns condemns the fair enchantment on my strain perhaps even now some cold fastidious judge casts a disdainful eye and calls my toil and calls the love and beauty which i sing the dream of folly thou grave censor say is beauty then a dream because the glooms of dullness hang too heavy on thy sense to let her shine upon thee so the man whose eye never opened on the light of heaven might smile with scorn while raptured vision tells of the gay colored radiance flushing bright over all creation from the wise be far such gross unhallowed pride nor needs my song descend so low but rather now unfold if human thought could reach or words unfold by what mysterious fabric of the mind the deepfelt joys and harmony of sound result from airy motion and from shape the lovely phantoms of sublime and fair by what fine ties has god connected things when present in the mind which in themselves have no connection sure the rising sun over the cerulean unequal of the sea with equal brightness and with equal warmth might roll his fiery orb nor yet the soul thus feel her frame expanded and her powers exulting in the splendor she beholds like a young conqror moving through the pomp of some triumphal day when joined at eve softmurmring streams and gales of gentlest breath melodious philomelas wakeful strain attempter could not mans discerning ear through all its tones the sympathy pursue nor yet this breath divine of nameless joy steal through his veins and fan the awakened heart mild as the breeze yet rapturous as the song but were not nature still endowed at large with all which life requires though unadorned with such enchantment wherefore then her form so exquisitely fair her breath persumd with such ethereal sweetness whence her voice informed at will to raise or to depress the impassioned soul and whence the robes of light which thus invest her with more lovely pomp than fancy can describe whence but from thee o source divine of everflowing love and thy unmeasured goodness not content with every sood of life to nourish man by kind illusions of the wondering sense thou make all nature beauty to his eye or music to his ear wellpleasd he scans the goodly prospect and with inward smiles treads the gay verdure of the painted plain beholds the azure canopy of heaven and living lamps that overarch his head with more than regal splendor bends his ears to the full choir of water air and earth nor heeds the pleasing error of his thought nor doubts the painted green or azure arch nor questions more the musicks mingling sounds than space or motion or eternal time so sweet he feels their influence to attract the sixed soul to brighten the dull glooms of care and make the destined road of life delightful to his feet so fables tell the adventurous hero bound on hard exploits beholds with glad surprise by secret spells of some kind sage the patron of his toils a visionary paradise disclosed amid the dubious wild with streams and shades and airy songs the enchanted landscape smiles cheers his long labors and renews his frame what then is taste but these internal powers active and strong and feelingly alive to each fine impulse a discerning sense of decent and sublime with quick disgust from things deformed or disarrangd or gross in species this nor gems nor stores of gold nor purple state nor culture can bestow but god alone when first his active hand imprints the secret bias of the soul he mighty parent wise and just in all free as the vital breeze or light of heaven reveals the charms of nature ask the swain who journeys homeward from a summer days long labor why forgetful of his toils and due repose he loiters to behold the sunshine gleaming as through amber clouds over all the western sky full soon i ween his rude expression and untutored airs beyond the power of language will unfold the form of beauty smiling at his heart how lovely how commanding but though heaven in every breast has sown these early seeds of love and admiration yet in vain without fair cultures kind parental aid without enlivening suns and genial showers and shelter from the blast in vain we hope the tender plant should rear its blooming head or yield the harvest promised in its spring nor yet will every soil with equal stores repay the tillers labor or attend his will obsequious whether to produce the olive or the laurel different minds incline to different objects one pursues the vast alone the wonderful the wild      one pursues  the vast alone etc see the note to    of this book  another sighs for harmony and grace and gentlest beauty hence when lightning fires the arch of heaven and thunders rock the ground when furious whirlwinds rend the howling air and ocean groaning from his lowest bed heaves his tempestous billows to the sky amid the mighty uproar while below the nations tremble shakespeare looks abroad from some high cliff superior and enjoys the elemental war but waller longs     waller longs etc o

their echoes mourn such and so various are the tastes of men oh blessed of heaven whom not the languid songs of luxury the siren not the bribes of sordid wealth nor all the gaudy spoils of pageant honor can seduce to leave those everblooming sweets which from the store of nature fair imagination culls to charm the enlivened soul what though not all of mortal offspring can attain the heights of envied life though only few possess patrician treasures or imperial state yet natures care to all her children just with richer treasures and an ampler state endows at large whatever happy man will deign to use them his the citys pomp the rural honors his whatever adorns the princely dome the column and the arch the breathing marbles and the sculptured gold beyond the proud possessors narrow claim his tuneful breast enjoys for him the spring distills her dews and from the silken gem its lucid leaves unfolds for him the hand of autumn tinges every fertile branch with blooming gold and blushes like the morn each passing hour sheds tribute from her wings and still new beauties meet his lonely walk and loves unfelt attract him not a breeze      not a breeze etc that this account may not appear rather poetically extravagant than just in philosophy it may be proper to produce the sentiment of one of the greatest wisest and best of men on this head one so little to be suspected to partiality in the case that he reckons it among those avours for which he was especially thankful to the gods that they had not suffered him to make any great proficiency in the arts of eloquence and poetry lest by that means he should have been diverted from pursuits of more importance to his high station speaking of the beauty of universal nature he observes that there is a pleasing and graceful aspect in every object we perceive when once we consider its connection with that general order he instances in many things which at first sight would be thought rather deformities and then adds that a man who enjoys a sensibility of temper with a just comprehension of the universal order  will dscern many amiable things not credible to every mind but to those alone who have entered into an honorable familiarity with nature and her works m ant iii    i lies over the meadow not a cloud imbibes the setting suns effulgence not a strain from all the tenants of the warbling shade ascends but whence his bosom can partake fresh pleasure unreprovd nor thence partakes fresh pleasure only for the attentive mind by this harmonious action on her powers becomes herself harmonious wont so often in outward things to meditate the charm of sacred order soon she seeks at home to find a kindred order to exert within herself this elegance of love this fair inspired delight her tempered powers refine at length and every passion wears a chaster milder more attractive mien but if to ampler prospects if to gaze on natures form where negligent of all these lesser graces she assumes the port of that eternal majesty that weighed the worlds foundations if to these the mind exalts her daring eye then mightier far will be the change and nobler would the forms of servile custom cramp her generous powers would sordid policies the barbarous growth of ignorance and rapine bow her down to tame pursuits to indolence and fear lo she appeals to nature to the winds and rolling waves the suns unwearied course the elements and seasons all declare for what the eternal maker has ordained the powers of man we feel within ourselves his energy divine he tells the heart he meant he made us to behold and love what he beholds and loves the general orb of life and being to be great like him beneficent and active thus the men whom natures works can charm with god himself hold converse grow familiar day by day with his conceptions act upon his plan and form to his the relish of their souls end of book third the pleasures of imagination the general argument the pleasures of the imagination proceed either from natural objects as from a flourishing grove a clear and murmuring fountain a calm sea by moonlight or from works of art such as a noble edifice a musical tune a  a picture a poem in treating of thse pleasures we must begin with the former class they being original to the other and nothing more being necessary in order to explain them than a view of our natural inclination toward greatness and beauty and of those appearances in the world around us to which that inclination is adapted this is the subject of the first book of the following poem  but the pleasures which we receive from the elegant arts from music sculpture painting and poetry are much more various and complicated in them besides greatness and beauty or forms proper to the imagination we find interwoven frequent representations of truth of virtue and vice of circumstances proper to move us with laughter or to encite in us pity fear and the other passions thse moral and intellectual objects are described in the second book to which the third properly belongs as an episode though too large to have been included in it  with the abovementioned causes of pleasure which are universal in the course of human life and appertain to our higher faculties many others do generally concur more limited in their operation or of an inferior origin such are the novelty of objects the association of ideas affections of the bodily senses influences of education national habits and the like to illustrate these and from the whole to determine the character of a perfect taste is the argument of the fourth book  hitherto the pleasures of the imagination belong to the human species in general but there are certain particular men whose imagination is endowed with powers and susceptible of pleasures which the generality of mankind never participate these are the men of genius destined by nature to excel in one or other of the arts already mentioned it is proposed therefore in the last place to delineate that genius which in some degree appears common to them all yet with a more peculiar consideration of poetry inasmuch as poetry is the most extensive of those arts the most philosophical and the most useful  the pleasures of imagination book i mdcclvii the argument the subject proposed dedication the ideas of the supreme being the exemplar of all things the variety of constitution in the minds of men with its final cause the general character of a fine imagination all the immediate pleasures of the human imagination proceed either from greatness or beauty in external objects the pleasure from greatness with its final cause the natural connection of beauty with truth truth is here taken not in a logical but in a mixed and popular sense or for what has been called the truth of things denoting as well their natural and regular condition as a proper estimate or judgment concerning them and good the different orders of beauty in different objects the infinite and allcomprehending form of beauty which belongs to the divine mind the partial and artificial forms of beauty which belong to inferior intellectual beings the origin and general conduct of beauty in man the subordination of local beauties to the beauty of the universe conclusion  with what enchantment natures goodly scene attracts the sense of mortals how the mind or its own eye does objects nobler still prepare how men by various lessons learn to judge of beautys praise what raptures fill the breast with fancys native arts endowed and what true culture guides it to renown my verse unfolds ye

thousand colors which in sport by the light glances of her magic eye she blends and shifts at will through countless forms her wild creation goddess of the lyre whose awful tones control the moving

the chosen breast and beauty with poetic wonder joined and inspiration ere the rising sun shone over the deep or mid the vault of night the moon her silver lamp suspended ere the vales with springs were watered or with groves of oak or pine the ancient hills were crowned then the great spirit whom his works adore within his own deep essence viewed the forms the forms eternal of created things the radiant sun the moons nocturnal lamp the mountains and the streams the ample stores of earth of heaven of nature from the first on that full scene his love divine he fixed his admiration till in time complete what he admired and loved his vital power unfolded into being hence the breath of life informing each organick frame hence the green earth and wild resounding waves hence light and shade alternate warmth and cold and bright autumnal skies and vernal showers and all the fair variety of things but not alike to every mortal eye is this great scene unveiled for while the claims of social life to different labors urge the active powers of man with wisest care has nature on the multitude of minds impressed a various bias and to each decreed its province in the common toil to some she taught the fabric of the sphere the changeful moon the circuit of the stars the golden zones of heaven to some she gave to search the story of eternal thought of space and time of fates unbroken chain and wills quick movement others by the hand she led over vales and mountains to explore what healing virtue dwells in every vein of herbs or trees but some to nobler hopes were destined some within a finer mould she wrought and tempered with a purer flame to these the sire omnipotent unfolds in fuller aspects and with fairer lights this picture of the world through every part they trace the lofty sketches of his hand in earth or air the meadows flowery store the moons mild radiance or the virgins mien dressed in attractive smiles they see portrayd as far as mortal eyes the portrait scan those lineaments of beauty which delight the mind supreme they also feel their force enamored they partake the eternal joy for as old memnons image long renowned through fabling egypt at the genial touch of morning from its inmost frame sent forth spontaneous music so does natures hand to certain attributes which matter claims adapt the finer organs of the mind so the glad impulse of those kindred powers of form of colours cheerful pomp of sound melodious or of motion aptly sped detains the enlivened sense till soon the soul feels the deep concord and assents through all her functions then the charm by fate prepared diffuseth its enchantment fancy dreams rapt into high discourse with prophets old and wandering through elysium fancy dreams of sacred fountains of oershadowing groves whose walks with godlike harmony resound fountains which homer visits happy groves where milton dwells the intellectual power on the minds throne suspends his graver cares and smiles the passions to divine repose persuaded yield and love and joy alone are waking love and joy such as await an angels meditation o attend whoever thou art whom these delights can touch whom natures aspect natures simple garb can thus command o listen to my song and i will guide thee to her blissful walks and teach thy solitude her voice to hear and point her gracious features to thy view know then whatever of the worlds ancient store whatever of mimick arts reflected scenes with love and admiration thus inspire attentive fancy her delighted sons in two illustrious orders comprehend selftaught from him whose rustic toil the lark cheers warbling to the bard whose daring thoughts range the full orb of being still the form which fancy worships or sublime or fair her votaries proclaim i see them dawn i see the radiant visions where they rise more lovely than when lucifer displays his glittering forehead through the gates of morn to lead the train of phoebus and the spring say why was man so eminently raised amid the vast creation why empowered through life and death to dart his watchful eye with thoughts beyond the limit of his frame but that the omnipotent might send him forth in sight of angels and immortal minds as on an ample theater to join in contest with his equals who shall best the task achieve the course of noble toils by wisdom and by mercy preordaind might send him forth the sovran good to learn to chase each meaner purpose from his breast and through the mists of passion and of sense and through the pelting storms of chance and pain to hold straight on with constant heart and eye still fixed upon his everlasting palm the approving smile of heaven else wherefore burns in mortal bosoms this unquenched hope that seeks from day to day sublimer ends happy though restless why departs the soul wide from the track and journey of her times to grasp the good she knows not in the field of things which may be in the spacious field of science potent arts or dreadful arms to raise up scenes in which her own desires contented may repose when things which are pull on her temper like a twice told tale her temper still demanding to be free spurning the rude control of wilful might proud of her dangers braved her griefs endured her strength severely proved to these high aims which reason and affection prompt in man not adverse nor unapt has nature framed his bold imagination for amid the various forms which this full world presents like rivala to his choice what human breast ever doubts before the transient and minute to prize the vast the stable the sublime who that from heights aerial sends his eye around a wild horizon and surveys indus or ganges rolling his broad wave through mountains plains through spacious cities old and regions dark with woods will turn away to mark the path of some penurious rill which murmreth at his feet where does the soul consent her soaring fancy to restrain which bears her up as on an eagles wings destined for highest heaven or which of fates tremendous barriers shall confine her flight to any humbler quarry the rich earth cannot detain her nor the ambient air with all its changes for a while with joy she hovers over the sun and views the small attendant orbs beneath his sacred beam emerging from the deep like clustered isles whose rocky shores to the glad sailors eye reflect the gleams of morning for a while with pride she sees his firm paternal sway bend the reluctant planets to move each round its perpetual year but soon she quits that prospect meditating lostier views she darts adventurous up the long career of comets through the constellations holds her course and now looks back on all the stars whose blended flames as with a milky stream part the blue region empyrean tracks where happy souls beyond this concave heaven abide she then explores whence purer light for countless ages travels through the abyss nor has in sight of mortals yet arrived upon the wide creations utmost shore at length she stands and the dread space beyond contemplates half recoiling nathless down the gloomy void astonished yet unquelld she plungeth down the unfathomable gulf where god alone has being there her hopes rest at the fated goal for from the birth of humankind the sovran maker said that not in humble nor in brief delight not in the fleeting echoes of renown powers purple robes nor pleasures flowery lap the soul should find contentment but from these turning disdainful to an equal good through natures opening walks enlarge her aim till every bound at length should disappear and infinite perfection fill the scene but lo where beauty dressed in gentler pomp with comely steps advancing claims the verse her charms inspire o beauty source of praise of honor even to mute and lifeless things o thou that kindlest in each human heart love and the wish of poets when their tongue would teach to other bosoms what so charms their own o child of nature and the soul in happiest hour brought forth the doubtful garb of words of earthly language all too mean too lowly i account in which to clothe thy form divine for thee the mind alone beholds nor half thy brightness can reveal through those dim organs whose corporeal touch oershadoweth thy pure essence yet my muse if fortune call thee to the task wait thou thy favorable seasons then while fear and doubt are absent through wide natures bounds expatiate with glad step and choose at will whatever bright spoils the florid earth contains whatever the waters or the liquid air to manifest unblemished beautys praise and over the breasts of mortals to extend her gracious empire will thou to the isles atlantic to the rich hesperian clime fly in the train of autumn and look on and learn from him while as he roves around wherever his fingers touch the fruitful grove the branches bloom with gold wherever his foot imprints the soil the ripening clusters swell turning aside their foliage and come forth in purple lights till every hillock glows as with the blushes of an evening sky or will thou that thessalian landscape trace where slow peneus his clear glassy tide draws smooth along between the winding cliffs of ossa and the pathless woods unshorn that wave over huge olympus down the stream look how the mountains with their double range embrace the vale of tempe from each side ascending steep to heaven a rocky mound covered with ivy and the laurel boughs that crowned young phoebus for the python slain fair tempe on whose primrose banks the morn awoke most fragrant and the noon reposed in pomp of lights and shadows most sublime whose lawns whose glades ere human footsteps yet had traced an entrance were the hallowed haunt of sylvan powers immortal where they sat often in the golden age the nymphs and fauns beneath some arbor branching over the flood and leaning round hung on the instructive lips of hoary pan or over some open dale danced in light measures to his sevnfold pipe while zephyrs wanton hand along their path flung showers of painted blossoms fertile dews and one perpetual spring but if our task more lofty rites demand with all good vows then let us hasten to the rural haunt where young melissa dwells nor thou refuse the voice which calls thee from thy loved retreat but hither gentle maid thy sootsteps turn here to thy own unquestionable theme o fair o graceful bend thy polished brow assenting and the gladness of thy eyes impart to me like mornings wished light seen through the vernal air by yonder stream where beech and elm along the bordring mead send forth wild melody from every bough together let us wander where the hills covered with fleeces to the lowing vale reply where tidings of content and peace each echo brings lo how the western fun over fields and floods over every living soul diffuseth glad repose there while i speak of beautys honors thou melissa thou shall hearken not unconscious while i tell how first from heaven she came how after all the works of life the elemental scenes the hours the seasons she had often explored at length her favorite mansion and her throne she fixed in womans form what pleasing ties to virtue bind her what effectual aid they lend each others power and how divine their union should some unambitious maid to all the enchantment of the idalian queen add sanctity and wisdom while my tongue prolongs the tale melissa thou may feign to wonder whence my rapture is inspired but soon the smile which dawns upon thy lip shall tell it and the tendrer bloom over all that soft cheek springing to the marble neck which bends aside in vain revealing more what it would thus keep silent and in vain the sense of praise dissembling then my song great natures winning arts which thus inform with joy and love the ragged bread of man should sound in numbers worthy of such a theme while all whose souls have ever felt the force of those enchanting pons to my lyre should throng attentive and receive once more their influence unobscurd by any cloud of vulgar care and purer than the hand of fortune can bestow nor to confirm their sway should awful contemplation scorn to join his dictate to the genuine strain of pleasures tongue nor yet ould pleasures ear be much averse ye chiefly gentle band of youths and virgins who through many a wish and many a fond pursuit as in some scene of magic bright and fleeting are allured by various beauty if the pleasing toil can yield a moments respite hither turn your favorable ear and trust my words i do not mean on blessed religions seat presenting superstitions gloomy form to dash your soothing hopes i do not mean to bid the jealous thundrer fire the heavens or shapes infernal rend the groaning earth and scare you from your joys my cheerful song with happier omens calls you to the field pleased with your generous ardour in the chase and warm like you then tell me for ye know does beauty ever deign to dwell where use and aptitude are strangers is her praise confesd in aught whose most peculiar ends are lame and fruitless or did nature mean this pleasing call the herald of a lie to hide the shame of discord and disease and win each fond admirer into sares foiled bassled no with better providence the general mother conscious how infirm her offspring tread the paths of good and ill thus to the choice of credulous desire does objects the completest of their tribe distinguish and commend yon flowery bank clothed in the soft magnificence of spring will not the flocks approve it will they ask the reedy fen for pasture that clear rill which trickleth murmuring from the mossy rock yields it less wholesome bevrage to the worn and thirsty travller than the standing pool with muddy weeds oergrown yon ragged vine whose lean and sullen clusters mourn the rage of eurus will the winepress or the bowl report of her as of the swelling grape which glitters through the tendrils like a gem when first it meets the sun or what are all the various charms to life and sense adjoind are they not pledges of a state entire where native order reigns with every part in health and every function well performed thus then at first was beauty sent from heaven the lovely ministress of truth and good in this dark world for truth and good are one and beauty dwells in them and they in her with like participation wherefore then o sons of earth would ye dissolve the tie o wherefore with a rash and greedy aim seek ye to rove through every flattering scene which beauty seems to deck nor once inquire where is the suffrage of eternal truth or where the seal of undeceitful good to save your search from folly wanting these lo beauty withers in your void embrace and with the glittering of an idiots toy did fancy mock your vows nor yet let hope that kindliest inmate of the youthful breast be hence appalled be turned to coward sloth sitting in silence with dejected eyes incurious and with folded hands far less let scorn of wild fantastic follys dreams or hatred of the bigots savage pride persuade you ever that beauty or the love which waits on beauty may not brook to hear the sacred lore of undeceitful good and truth eternal from the vulgar crowd though superstition tyranness abhorred the reverence due to this majestic pair with threats and execration still demands though the tame wretch who asks of her the way to their celestial dwelling she constrains to quench or set at naught the lamp of god within his frame through many a cheerless wild though forth she leads him credulous and dark and awed with dubious notion though at length happily she plunge him into cloistered cells and mansions unrelenting as the grave but void of quiet there to watch the hours of midnight there amid the screaming owls dire song with specter or with guilty shades to talk of pangs and everlasting woe yet be not ye dismayed a gentler star presides over your adventure from the bower where wisdom sat with her athenian sons could but my happy hand intwine a wreath of platos olive with the mantuan bay then for what need of cruel fear to you to you whom godlike love can well command then should my powerful voice at once dispel those monkish horrors should in words divine relate how favored minds like you inspired and taught their inspiration to conduct by ruling heavens decree through various walks and prospects various but delightful all move onward while now myrtle groves appear now arms and radiant trophies now the rods of empire with the curule throne or now the domes of contemplation and the muse led by that hope sublime whose cloudless eye through the fair toils and ornaments of earth discerns the nobler life reserved for heaven eatd alike they worship round the shrine where truth conspicous with her sistertwins the undivided partners of her sway with good and beauty reigns o let not us by pleasures lying blandishments detained or crouching to the frowns of bigot rage o let not us one moment pause to join that chosen band and if the gracious power who first awakened my untutored song will to my invocation grant anew the tuneful spirit then through all our paths never shall the sound of this devoted lyre be wanting whether on the rosy mead when summer smiles to warn the melting heart of luxurys allurement whether firm against the torrent and the stubborn hill to urge free virtues steps and to her side summon that strong divinity of soul which conquers chance and fate or on the height the goal assigned her happily to proclaim her triumph on her brow to place the crown of uncorrupted praise through future worlds to follow her interminated way and bless heavens image in the heart of man such is the worth of beauty such her power so blameless so revered it now remains in just gradation through the various ranks of being to contemplate how her gifts rise in due measure watchful to attend the steps of rising nature last and least in colors mingling with a random blaze does beauty dwell then higher in the forms of simplest easiest measure in the bounds of circle cube or sphere the third ascent to symmetry adds color thus the pearl shines in the concave of its purple bed and painted shells along some winding shore catch with indented folds the glancing sun next as we rise appear the blooming tribes which clothe the fragrant earth which draw from her their own nutrition which are born and die yet in their seed immortal such the flowers with which young maia pays the village maids that hail her natal morn and such the groves which blithe pomona rears on vagas bank to seed the bowl of ariconian swains who quaff beneath her branches nobler still is beautys name where to the full consent of members and of features to the pride of color and the vital change of growth lifes holy flame with piercing sense is given while active motion speaks the tempered soul so moves the bird of juno so the steed with rival swiftness heats the dusty plain and faithful dogs with eager airs of joy salute their fellows what sublimer pomp adorns the seat where virtue dwells on earth and truths eternal daylight shines around what palm belongs to mans imperial front and woman powerful with becoming smiles chief of terrestrial natures need we now strive to inculcate thus has beauty there her most conspicous praise to matter lent where most conspicous through that shadowy  breaks forth the bright expression of a mind by steps directing our enraptured search to him the first of minds the chief the sole from whom through this wide complicated world did all her various lineaments begin to whom alone consenting and entire at once their mutual influence all display he god most high bear witness earth and heaven the living fountains in himself contains of beauteous and sublime with him enthroned ere days or years trod their ethereal way in his supreme intelligence enthroned the queen of love holds her unclouded state urania thee o father this extent of matter thee the sluggish earth and track of seas the heavens and heavenly splendours feel pervading quickening moving from the depth of thy great essence forth did thou conduct eternal form and there where chaos reigned gavst her dominion to erect her seat and sanctify the mansion all her works wellpleasd thou did behold the gloomy fires of storm or earthquake and the purest light of summer soft campanias newborn rose and the slow weed which pines on russian hills comely alike to thy full vision stand to thy surrounding vision which unites all essences and powers of the great world in one sole order fair alike they stand as features well consenting and alike required by nature ere she could attain her just resemblance to the perfect shape of universal beauty which with thee dwelt from the first thou also ancient mind whom love and free beneficence await in all thy doings to inferior minds thy offspring and to man thy youngest son refusing no convenient gift nor good their eyes did open in this earth yon heaven those starry worlds the countenance divine of beauty to behold but not to them did thou her awful magnitude reveal such as before thine own unbounded sight she stands for never shall created soul conceive that object nor to all their kinds the same in shape or features did thou frame her image measuring well their different spheres of sense and action thy paternal hand has for each race prepared a different test of beauty owned and reverenced as their guide most apt most faithful thence informed they scan the objects that surround them and select since the great whole disclaims their scanty view each for himself selects peculiar parts of nature what the standard fixed by heaven within his breast approves acquiring thus a partial beauty which becomes his lot a beauty which his eye may comprehend his hand may copy leaving o supreme o thou whom none has uttered leaving all to thee that infinite consummate form which the great powers the gods around thy throne and nearest to thy counsels know with thee for ever to have been but who she is or what her likeness know not man surveys a narrower scene where by the mixed effect of things corporeal on his passive mind he judges what is fair corporeal things the mind of man impel with various powers and various features to his eye disclose the powers which move his sense with instant joy the features which attract his heart to love he marks combines reposits other powers and features of the selfsame thing unless the beauteous form the creature of his mind request their close alliance he oerlooks forgotten or with selfbeguiling zeal whenever his passions mingle in the work half alters half disowns the tribes of men thus from their different functions and the shapes familiar to their eye with art obtain unconscious of their purpose yet with art obtain the beauty fitting man to love whose proud desires from natures homely toil often turn away fastidious asking still his minds high aid to purify the form from matters gross communion to secure for ever from the meddling hand of change or rude decay her features and to add whatever ornaments may suit her mien whatever he finds them scattered through the paths of nature or of fortune then he seats the accomplished image deep within his breast reviews it and accounts it good and fair thus the one beauty of the world entire the universal venus far beyond the keenest effort of created eyes and their most wide horizon dwells enthroned in ancient silence at her footstool stands an altar burning with eternal fire unsullied unconsumd here every hour here every moment in their turns arrive her offspring an innumerable band of sisters comely all but differing far in age in stature and expressive mien more than bright helen from her newborn babe to this maternal shrine in turns they come each with her sacred lamp that from the source of living flame which here immortal slows their portions of its luster they may draw for days or months or years for ages some as their great parents discipline requires then to their several mansions they depart in stars in planets through the unknown shores of yon ethereal ocean who can tell even on the surface of this rolling earth how many make abode the fields the groves the winding rivers and the azure main are rendered solemn by their frequent feet their rites sublime there each her destined home informs with that pure radiance from the skies brought down and shines throughout her little sphere exulting straight as travelers by night turn toward a distant flame so some fit eye among the various tenants of the scene discerns the heavenborn phantom seated there and owns her charms hence the wide universe through all the seasons of revolving worlds bears witness with its people gods and men to beautys blissful power and with the voice of grateful admiration still resounds that voice to which is beautys frame divine as is the cunning of the masters hand to the sweet accent of the welltund lyre genius of ancient greece whose faithful steps have led us to these awful solitudes of nature and of science nurse revered of generous counsels and heroic deeds o let some portion of thy matchless praise dwell in my breast and teach me to adorn this unattempted theme nor be my thoughts presumptous counted if amid the calm which hesper sheds along the vernal heaven if i from vulgar superstitions

themes the british lyre end of book first the pleasures of imagination book ii the argument introduction to this more difficult part of the subject of truth and its three classes matter of fact experimental or scientifical truth cont distinguished from opinion and universal truth which last is either metaphysical or geometrical either purely intellectual or perfectly aacted on the power of discerning truth depends that of acting with the view of an end a circumstance essential to virtue of virtue considered in the divine mind as a perpetual and universal beneficence of human virtue considered as a sysem of particular sentiments and actions suitable to the design of providence and the condition of man to whom it constitutes the chief good and the first beauty of vice and its origin of ridicule its general nature and final cause of the passions particularly of those which relate to evil natural or moral and which are generally accounted painful though not always unattended with pleasure  thus far of beauty and the pleasing forms which mans untutored fancy from the scenes imperfect of this everchanging world creates and views enamored now my song severer themes demand mysterious truth and virtue sovran good the spells the trains the progeny of error the dread sway of passion and whatever hidden stores from her own lofty deeds and from herself the mind acquires severer argument not less attractive nor deserving less a constant ear for what are all the forms educd by fancy from corporeal things greatness or pomp or symmetry of parts not tending to the heart soon seeble grows as the blunt arrow against the knotty trunk their impulse on the sense while the palled eye expects in vain its tribute asks in vain where are the ornaments it once admired not so the moral species nor the powers of passion and of thought the ambitious mind with objects boundless as her own desires can there converse by these unfading forms touched and awakened still with eager act she bends each nerve and meditates wellpleasd her gifts her godlike fortune such the seenes now opening round us may the destined verse maintain its equal tenor though in tracks obscure and ardous may the source of light allpresent allsufficient guide our steps through every maze and whom in childish years from the loud throng the beaten paths of wealth and power thou did apart send forth to speak in tuneful words concerning highest things him still do thou o father at those hours of pensive freedom when the human soul shuts out the rumor of the world him still touch thou with secret lessons call thou back each erring thought and let the yielding strains from his full bosom like a welcome rill spontaneous from its healthy fountain flow but from what name what favorable sign what heavenly auspice rather shall i date my perilous excursion than from truth that nearest inmate of the human soul estranged from whom the countenance divine of man dissigurd and dishonored sinks among inferior things for to the brutes perception and the transient boons of sense has fate imparted but to man alone of sublunary beings was it given each fleeting impulse on the sensual powers at leisure to review with equal eye to sean the passion of the stricken nerve or the vague object striking to conduct from sense the portal turbulent and loud into the minds wide palace one by one the frequent pressing fluctuating forms and question and compare them thus he learns their birth and fortunes how allied they haunt the avenues of sense what laws direct their union and what various discords rise or fixed or casual which when his clear thought retains and when his faithful words express that living image of the external scene as in a polished mirror held to view is truth wherever it varies from the shape and hue of its exemplar in that part dim error lurks moreover from without when often the same society of forms in the same order have approached his mind he deigns no more their steps with curious heed to trace no more their features or their garb he now examines but of them and their condition as with some diviners tongue affirms what heaven in every distant place through every future season will decree this too is truth wherever his prudent lips wait till experience diligent and flow has authorized their sentence this is truth a second higher kind the parent this of science or the losty power herself science herself on whom the wants and cares of social life depend the substitute of gods own wisdom in this toilsome world the providence of man yet ost in vain to earn her aid with fixed and anxious eye he looks on natures and on fortunes course too much in vain his duller visual ray the stillness and the persevering acts of nature often elude and fortune often with step fantastic from her wonted walk turns into mazes dim his sight is foiled and the crude sentence of his faltring tongue is but opinions verdict half believed and prone to change here thou who feelst thine ear congenial to my lyres profounder tone pause and be watchful hitherto the stores which feed thy mind and exercise her powers partake the relish of their native soil their parent earth but know a nobler dower her sire at birth decreed her purer gifts from his own treasure forms which never deigned in eyes or ears to dwell within the sense of earthly organs but sublime were placed in his essential reason leading there that vast ideal host which all his works through endless ages never will reveal thus then endowed the feeble creature man the slave of hunger and the prey of death even now even here in earths dim prison bound the language of intelligence divine attains repeating often concerning one and many past and present parts and whole those sovran dictates which in farthest heaven where no orb rowls eternitys fixed ear hears from coeval truth when chance nor change natures loud progeny nor natures self dares intermeddle or approach her throne ere long over this corporeal world he learns to extend her sway while calling from the deep from earth and air their multitudes untold of figures and of motions round his walk for each wide family some single birth he sets in view the impartial type of all its brethren suffering it to claim beyond their common heritage no private gift no proper fortune then whatever his eye in this discerns his bold unerring tongue pronounces of the kindred without bound without condition such the rise of forms sequestered far from sense and every spot peculiar in the realms of space or time such is the throne which man for truth amid the paths of mutability has built secure unshaken still and whence he views in matters mouldering structures the pure forms of triangle or circle cube or cone impassive all whose attributes nor force nor fate can alter there he first conceives true being and an intellectual world the same this hour and ever thence he deems of his own lot above the painted shapes that fleeting move over this terrestrial scene looks up beyond the adamantine gates of death expatiates as his birthright claims inheritance in all the works of god prepares for endless time his plan of life and counts the universe itself his home whence also but from truth the light of minds is human fortune gladdend with the rays of virtue with the moral colors thrown on every walk of this our social scene adorning for the eye of gods and men the passions actions habitudes of life and rendring earth like heaven a sacred place where love and praise may take delight to dwell let none with heedless tongue from truth disjoin the reign of virtue ere the dayspring flowed like sisters linked in concords golden chain they stood before the great eternal mind their common parent and by him were both sent forth among his creatures hand in hand inseparably joined nor ever did truth find an apt ear to listen to her lore which knew not virtues voice nor save where truths majestic words are heard and understood does virtue deign to inhabit go inquire of nature not among tartarean rocks whither the hungry vulture with its prey returns not where the lions sullen roar at noon resounds along the lonely banks of ancient tigris but her gentler scenes the dovecote and the shepherds fold at morn consult or by the meadows fragrant hedge in springtime when the woodlands first are green attend the linnet singing to his mate couched over their tender young to this fond care thou do not virtues honorable name attribute wherefore save that not one gleam of truth did ever discover to themselves their little hearts or teach them by the effects of that parental love the love itself to judge and measure its officious deeds but man whose eyelids truth has filled with day discerns how skilfully to bounteous ends his wise affections move with free accord adopts their guidance yields himself secure to natures prudent impulse and converts instinct to duty and to sacred law hence right and fit on earth while thus to man the almighty legislator has explained the springs of action fixed within his breast has given him power to slacken or restrain their effort and has shown him how they join their partial movements with the masterwheel of the great world and serve that sacred end which he the unerring reason keeps in view for if a mortal tongue may speak of him and his dread ways even as his boundless eye connecting every form and every change beholds the perfect beauty so his will through every hour producing good to all the family of creatures is itself the perfect virtue let the grateful swain remember this as often with joy and praise he looks upon the falling dews which clothe his lawns with verdure and the tender seed nourish within his surrows when between dead seas and burning skies where long unmoved the bark had languishd now a rustling gale lifts over the fickle waves the dancing prow let the glad pilot bursting out in thanks remember this lest blind oerweening pride pollute their offerings lest their selfish heart say to the heavenly ruler at our call relents thy power by us thy arm is moved fools who of god as of each other deem who his invariable acts deduce from sudden counsels transient as their own no farther of his bounty than the event which happily meets their loud and eager prayer acknowledge nor beyond the drop minute which happily they have tasted heed the source that flows for all the fountain of his love which from the summit where he sits enthroned pours health and joy unailing streams throughout the spacious region flourishing in view the goodly work of his eternal day his own fair universe on which alone his counsels ix and whence alone his will assumes her strong direction such is now his sovran purpose such it was before all multitude of years for his right arm was never idle his bestowing love knew no beginning was not as a change of mood that woke at last and started up after a deep and solitary sloth of boundless ages no he now is good he ever was the feet of hoary time through their eternal course have traveled over no speechless lifeless desert but through scenes cheerful with bounty still among a pomp of worlds for gladness round the makers throne loud shouting or in many dialects of hope and filial trust imploring thence the fortunes of their people where so fixed were all the dates of being so disposed to every living soul of every kind the field of motion and the hour of rest that each the general happiness might serve and by the discipline of laws divine convinced of folly or chastised from guilt each might at length be happy what remains shall be like what is passed but fairer still and still increasing in the godlike gifts of life and truth the same paternal hand from the mute shellfish gasping on the shore to men to angels to celestial minds will ever lead the generations on through higher scenes of being while supplied from day to day by his enlivening breath inferior orders in succession rise to fill the void below as flame ascends as vapors to the earth in showers return as the poised ocean towered the attracting moon swells and the ever listening planets charmed by the suns call their onward pace incline so all things which have life aspire to god exhaustless fount of intellectual day center of souls nor does the mastring voice of nature cease within to prompt aright their steps nor is the care of heaven withheld from sending to the toil external aid that in their stations all may persevere to climb the ascent of being and approach for ever nearer to the life divine but this eternal fabric was not raised for mans inspection though to some be given to catch a transient visionary glimpse of that majestic scene which boundless power prepares for perfect goodness yet in vain would human life her faculties expand to imbosom such an object nor could ever virtue or praise have touched the hearts of men had not the sovran guide through every stage of this their various journey pointed out new hopes new toils which to their humble sphere of sight and strength might such importance hold as does the wide creation to his own hence all the little charities of life with all their duties hence that favorite palm of human will when duty is sufficed and still the liberal soul in ampler deeds would manifest herself that sacred sign of her revered affinity to him whose bounties are his own to whom none said create the wisest fullest fairest world and make its offspring happy who intent some likeness of himself among his works to view has poured into the human breast a ray of knowledge and of love which guides earths feeble race to act their makers part selfjudging selfobligd while from before that godlike function the gigantick powr necessity though wont to curb the force of chaos and the savage elements retires abashed as from a scene too high for her brute tyranny and with her bears her scorned followers terror and base awe who blinds herself and that illsuited pair obedience linked with hatred then the soul arises in her strength and looking round her busy sphere whatever work she views whatever counsel bearing any trace of her creators likeness whether apt to aid her fellows or preserve herself in her superior functions unimpaird thither she turns exulting that she claims as her peculiar good on that through all the fickle seasons of the day she looks with reverence still to that as to a sense against affliction and the darts of pain her drooping hopes repair and once opposed to that all other pleasure other wealth vile as the dross upon the molten gold appears and loathsome as the briny sea to him who languishes with thirst and sighs for some known fountain pure for what can strive with virtue which of natures regions vast can in so many forms produce to sight such powerful beauty beauty which the eye of hatred cannot look upon secure which envys self contemplates and is turned ere long to tenderness to infant smiles or tears of humblest love is aught so fair in all the dewy landscapes of the spring the summers noontide groves the purple eve at harvesthome or in the frosty moon glittering on some smooth sea is aught so fair as virtuous friendship as the honored roof whither from highest heaven immortal love his torch ethereal and his golden bow propitious brings and there a temple holds to whose unspotted service gladly vowed the social band of parent brother child with smiles and sweet discourse and gentle deeds adore his power what gift of richest clime ever drew such eager eyes or prompted such deep wishes as the zeal that snatcheth back from slanders poisonous tooth a foes renown or crosses danger in his lion walk a rivals life to rescue as the young athenian warrior sitting down in bonds that his great fathers body might not want a peaceful humble tomb the roman wife teaching her lord how harmless was the wound of death how impotent the tyrants rage who nothing more could threaten to afflict their faithful love or is there in the abyss is there among the adamantine spheres wheeling unshaken through the boundless void aught that with half such majesty can fill the human bosom as when brutus rose refulgent from the stroke of caesars sat amid the crowd of patriots and his arm aloft extending like eternal jove when guilt brings down the thunder called aloud on tullys name and shook the crimson sword of justice in his rapt astonished eye and bad the father of his country hail for lo the tyrant prostrate on the dust and rome again is free thus through the paths of human life in various pomp arrayed walks the wise daughter of the judge of heaven fair virtue from her fathers throne supreme sent down to utter laws such as on earth most apt he knew most powerful to promote the weal of all his works the gracious end of his dread empire and though happily mans obscurer sight so far beyond himself and the brief labors of his little home extends not yet by the bright presence won of this divine instructress to her sway pleased he assents nor heeds the distant goal to which her voice conducts him thus has god still looking towered his own high purpose fixed the virtues of his creatures thus he rules the parents fondness and the patriots zeal thus the warm sense of honor and of shame the vows of gratitude the faith of love and all the comely intercourse of praise the joy of human life the earthly heaven how far unlike them must the lot of guilt be found or what terrestrial woe can match the selfconvicted bosom which has wrought the bane of others or enslaved itself with shackles vile not poison nor sharp fire nor the worst pangs that ever monkish hate suggested or despotick rage imposed were at that season an unwishd exchange when the soul loathes herself when flying thence to crowds on every brow she sees portrayd fell demons hate or scorn which drive her back to solitude her judges voice divine to hear in secret happily sounding through the troubled dreams of midnight and still still demanding for his violated laws fit recompense or charging her own tongue to speak the award of justice on herself for well she knows what faithful hints within were whispered to beware the lying forms which turned her footsteps from the safer way what cautions to suspect their painted dress and look with steady eyelid on their smiles their frowns their tears in vain the dazzling hues of fancy and opinions eager voice too much prevailed for mortals tread the path in which opinion says they follow good or fly from evil and opinion gives report of good or evil as the scene was drawn by fancy pleasing or deformed thus her report can never there be true where fancy cheats the intellectual eye with glaring colors and distorted lines is there a man to whom the name of death brings terrours ghastly pageants conjured up before him deathbed groans and dismal vows and the frail soul plunged headlong from the brink of life and daylight down the gloomy air an unknown depth to gulfs of torturing sire unvisited by mercy then what hand can snatch this dreamer from the fatal toils which fancy and opinion thus conspire to twine around his heart or who shall hush their clamor when they tell him that to die to risk those horrors is a direr curse than basest life can bring though love with prayers most tender with afflictions sacred tears beseech his aid though gratitude and faith condemn each step which loiters yet let none make answer for him that if any frown of danger thwart his path he will not stay content and be a wretch to be secure here vice begins then at the gate of life ere the young multitude to diverse roads part like fond pilgrims on a journey unknown sits fancy deep enchantress and to each with kind maternal looks presents her bowl a potent bevrage heedless they comply till the whole soul from that mysterious draught is tinged and every transient thought imbibes of gladness or disgust desire or fear one homebred color which not all the lights of science ever shall change not all the storms of adverse fortune wash away nor yet the robe of purest virtue quite conceal thence on they pass where meeting frequent shapes of good and evil cunning phantoms apt to fire or freeze the breast with them they join in dangerous parley listening often and often gazing with reckless passion while its garb the spectre heightens and its pompous tale repeats with some new circumstance to suit that early tincture of the hearers soul and should the guardian reason but for one short moment yield to this illusive scene his ear and eye the intoxicating charm involves him till no longer he discerns or only guides to err then revel forth a furious band that spurn him from the throne and all is uproar hence ambition climbs with sliding feet and hands impure to grasp those solemn toys which glitter in his view on fortunes rugged steep hence pale revenge unsheaths her murderous dagger rapine hence and envious lust by venal fraud upborne surmount the reverend barrier of the laws which kept them from their prey hence all the crimes that ever defiled the earth and all the plagues that follow them for vengeance in the guise of honor safety pleasure ease or pomp stole first into the fond believing mind yet not by fancys witchcraft on the brain are always the tumultous passions driven to guilty deeds nor reason bound in chains that vice alone may lord it often adorned with motley pageants folly mounts his throne and plays her idiot anticks like a queen a thousand garbs she wears a thousand ways she whirls her giddy empire  lo thus far with hold adventure to the mantuan lyre i sing for contemplation linked with love a pensive theme now happily should my song unbend that serious countenance and learn thalias tripping gait her shrilltond voice her wiles familiar whether scorn she darts in wanton ambush from her lip or eye or whether with a sad disguise of care oermantling her gay brow she acts in sport the deeds of folly and from all sides round calls forth impetuous laughters gay rebuke her province but through every comic scene to lead my muse with her light pencil armed through every swift occasion which the hand of laughter points at when the mirthful sting distends her laboring sides and chokes her tongue were endless as to sound each grating note with which the rooks and chattring daws and grave unwieldy inmates of the village pond the changing seasons of the sky proclaim sun cloud or shower suffice it to have said wherer the power of ridicule displays her quainteyd visage some incongrous form some stubborn dissonance of things combined strikes on her quick perception whether pomp or praise or beauty be dragged in and shown where sordid fashions where ignoble deeds where foul deformity is wont to dwell or whether these with shrewd and wayward spite invade resplendent pomps imperious mien the charms of beauty or the boast of praise ask we for what fair end the almighty sire in mortal bosoms stirs this gay contempt these grateful pangs of laughter from disgust educing pleasure wherefore but to aid the tardy steps of reason and at once by this prompt impulse urge us to depress wild follys aims for though the sober light of truth slow dawning on the watchful mind at length unfolds through many a subtle tie how these uncouth disorders end at last in public evil yet benignant heaven conscious how dim the dawn of truth appears to thousands conscious what a scanty pause from labor and from care the wider lot of humble life affords for studious thought to scan the maze of nature therefore stamped these glaring scenes with characters of scorn as broad as obvious to the passing clown as to the lettered sages curious eye but other evils over the steps of man through all his walks impend against whose might the slender darts of laughter naught avail a trivial warfare some like cruel guards on natures evermoving throne attend with mischief armed for him whoever shall thwart the path of her inexorable wheels while she pursues the work that must be done through ocean earth and air hence frequent forms of woe the merchant with his wealthy bark buried by dashing waves the traveller pierced by the pointed lightning in his haste and the poor husbandman with folded arms surveying his lost labors and a heap of blasted chaff the product of the field whence he expected bread but worse than these i deem far worse that other race of ills which humankind rear up among themselves that horrid offpring which misgovernd will bs to fantastic error vices crimes furies that curse the earth and make the blows the heaviest blows of natures innocent hand seem sport which are indeed but as the care of a wise parent who solicits good to all her house though happily at the price of tears and froward wailing and reproach from some unthinking child whom not the less its mother destines to be happy still these sources then of pain this double lot of evil in the inheritance of man required for his protection no slight force no careless watch and therefore was his breast fenced round with passions quick to be alarmed or stubborn to oppose with fear more swift than beacons catching flame from hill to hill where armies land with anger uncontrolled as the young lion bounding on his prey with sorrow that locks up the struggling heart and shame that overcasts the drooping eye as with a cloud of lightning these the part perform of eager monitors and goad the soul more sharply than with points of steel her enemies to shun or to resist and as those passions that converse with good are good themselves as hope and love and joy among the fairest and the sweetest boons of life we rightly count so these which guard against invading evil still excite some pain some tumult these within the mind too often admitted or too long retained shock their frail eat and by their uncurbd rage to savages more fell than libya breeds transform themselves till human thought becomes a gloomy ruin haunt of shapes unblessed of selftormenting fiends horror despair hatred and wicked envy foes to all the works of nature and the gifts of heaven but when through blameless paths to righteous ends those keener passions urge the awakened soul i would not as ungracious violence their sway describe nor from their free career the fellowship of pleasure quite exclude for what can render to the selfapprovd their temper void of comfort though in pain who knows not with what majesty divine the forms of truth and justice to the mind appear ennobling often the sharpest woe with triumph and rejoicing who that bears a human bosom has not often felt how dear are all those ties which bind our race in gentleness together and how sweet their force let fortunes wayward hand the while be kind or cruel ask the faithful youth why the cold urn of her whom long he loved so often fills his arms so often draws his lonely footsteps silent and unseen to pay the mournful tribute of his tears oh he will tell thee that the wealth of worlds should never seduce his bosom to forego those sacred hours when stealing from the noise of care and envy sweet remembrance sooths with virtues kindest looks his aching breast and turns his tears to rapture ask the crowd which flies impatient from the village walk to climb the neighboring cliffs when far below the savage winds have hurled upon the coast some helpless bark while holy pity melts the general eye or terrours icy hand smites their distorted limbs and horrent hair while every mother closer to her breast catches her child and pointing where the waves foam through the shattered vessel shrieks aloud as one poor wretch who spreads his piteous arms for succor swallowed by the roaring surge as now another dashed against the rock drops lifeless down o deemest thou indeed no pleasing influence here by nature given to mutual terror and compassions tears no tender charm mysterious which attracts over all that edge of pain the social powers to this their proper action and their end ask thy own heart when at the midnight hour slow through that pensive gloom thy pausing eye led by the glimmering taper moves around the reverend volumes of the dead the songs of grecian hards and records writ by fame for grecian heroes where the sovran power of heaven and earth surveys the immortal page even as a father meditating all the praises of his son and bids the rest of mankind there the fairest model learn of their own nature and the noblest deeds which yet the world has seen if then thy soul join in the lot of those diviner men say when the prospect darkens on thy view when sunk by many a wound heroic states mourn in the dust and tremble at the frown of hard ambition when the generous band of youths who fought for freedom and their fires lie side by side in death when brutal force usurps the throne of justice turns the pomp of guardian power the majesty of rule the sword the laurel and the purple robe to poor dishonest pageants to adorn a robbers walk and glitter in the eyes of such as bow the knee when beauteous works rewards of virtue sculptured forms which decked with more than human grace the warriours arch or patriots tomb now victims to appease tyrannick envy strew the common path with awful ruins when the muses haunt the marble porch where wisdom wont to talk with socrates or tully hears no more save the hoarse jargon of contentious monks or fale supetions midnight prayer when ruthless havoc from the hand of time tears the destroying sith with surer stroke to mow the monuments of glory down till desolation over the grassgrown street expands her raven wings and from the gate where senates once the weal of nations planned hisseth the gliding snake through hoary weeds that clasp the mouldering column thus when all the widely mournful scene is fixed within thy throbbing bosom when the patriots tear starts from thine eye and thy extended arm in fancy hurls the thunderbolt of jove to fire the impious wreath on philips brow or dash octavius from the trophyd car say does thy secret soul repine to taste the big distress or would thou then exchange those heartennobling sorrows for the lot of him who sits amid the gaudy herd of silent flattrers bending to his nod and over them like a giant casts his eye and says within himself i am a king and wherefore should the clamorous voice of woe intrude upon mine ear the dregs corrupt of barbarous ages that circean draught of servitude and folly have not yet blessed be the eternal ruler of the world yet have not so dishonored so deformed the native judgment of the human soul nor so effaced the image of her sire the pleasures of imagination book iii mdcclxx what tongue then may explain the various fate which reigns over earth or who to mortal eyes illustrate this perplexing labyrinth of joy and woe through which the feet of man are doomed to wander that eternal mind from passions wants and envy far estranged who built the spacious universe and decked each part so richly with whatever pertains to life to health to pleasure why bad he the viper evil creeping in pollute the goodly scene and with insidious rage while the poor inmate looks around and smiles dart her fell sting with poision to his soul hard is the question and from ancient days has still oppressed with care the sages thought has drawn forth accents from the poets lyre too sad too deeply plaintive nor did ever those chiefs of humankind from whom the light of heavenly truth first gleamd on barbarous lands forget this dreadful secret when they told what wondrous things had to their favored eyes and ears on cloudy mountain been revealed or in deep cave by nymph or power divine portentous often and wild yet one i know could i the speech of lawgivers assume one old and splendid tale i would record with which the muse of solon in sweet strains adorned this theme profound and rendered all its darkness all its terrors bright as noon or gentle as the golden star of eve who knows not solon last and wisest far of those whom greece triumphant in the height of glory styled her fathers him whose voice through athens hushed the storm of civil wrath taught envious want and cruel wealth to join in friendship and with sweet compalsion tamed minervas eager people to his laws which their own goddess in his breast inspired twas now the time when his heroic task seemed but performed in vain when soothed by years of sattring service the fond multitude hung with their sudden counsels on the breath of great pisistratus that chief renowned whom hermes and the idalian queen had trained even from his birth to every powerful art of pleasing and persuading from whose lips flowed eloquence which like the vows of love could steal away suspicion from the hearts of all who listened thus from day to day he won the general suffrage and beheld each rival overshadowd and depressed beneath his ampler state yet often complained as one less kindly treated who had hoped to merit favor but submits perforce to find anothers services preferred nor yet relaxeth aught of faith or zeal then tales were scattered of his envious foes of snares that watched his fame of daggers aimed against his life at last with trembling limbs his hair diffused and wild his garments loose and stained with blood from selfinflicted wounds he burst into the public place as there there only were his refuge and declared in broken words with sighs of deep regret the mortal danger he had scarce repelled fired with his tragic tale the indignant crowd to guard his steps forthwith a menial band arrayed beneath his eye for deeds of war decree o still too liberal of their trust and often betrayed by overgrateful love the generous people now behold him fenced by mercenary weapons like a king forth issuing from the city gate at eve to seek his rural mansion and with pomp crowding the public road the swain stops short and sighs the officious townsmen stand at gaze and shrinking give the sullen pageant room yet not the less obsequious was his brow nor less profuse of courteous words his tongue of gracious gifts his hand the while by stealth like a small torrent fed with evening showers his train increased till at that satal time just as the public eye with doubt and shame startled began to question what it saw swift as the sound of earthquakes rushed a voice through athens that pisistratus had filled the rocky citadel with hostile arms had barred the steep ascent and sat within amid his hirelings meditating death to all whose stubborn necks his yoke resusd where then was solon after ten long years of absence full of haste from foreign shores the sage the lawgiver had now arrived arrived alas to see that athens that fair temple raised by him and sacred called to liberty and concord now profaned by savage hate or sunk into a den of slaves who crouch beneath the masters scourge and deprecate his wrath and court his chains yet did not the wise patriots grief impede his virtous will nor was his heart inclined one moment with such womanlike distress to view the transient storms of civil war as thence to yield his country and her hopes to alldevouring bondage his bright helm even while the traitors impious act is told he buckles on his hoary head he girds with mail his stooping breast the shield the spear he snatcheth and with swift indignant strides wh assembled people seeks proclaims aloud it was no time for counsel in their spears lay all their prudence now the tyrant yet was not so firmly seated on his throne but that one shock of their united force would dash him from the summit of his pride headlong and grovlling in the dust what else can reassert the lost athenian name so cheaply to the laughter of the world betrayed by guile beneath an infants faith so mocked and scorned away then freedom now and safety dwell not but with fame in arms myself will show you where their mansion lies and through the walks of danger or of death conduct you to them while he spoke through all their crowded ranks his quick sagacious eye he darted where no cheerful voice was heard of social daring no stretched arm was seen hastening their common task but pale mistrust wrinkled each brow theyshook their heads and down their slack hands hung cold sighs and whispered doubts from breath to breath stole round the sage meantime looked speechless on while his big bosom heaved struggling with shame and sorrow till at last a tear broke forth and o immortal shades o theseus he exclaimed o codrus where where are ye now behold for what ye toiled through life behold for whom ye chose to die no more he added but with lonely steps weary and slow his silver beard depressed and his stern eyes bent heedless on the ground back to his silent dwelling he repaired there over the gate his armor as a man whom from the service of the war his chief dismisseth after no inglorious toil he fixed in general view one wishful look he sent unconscious towered the public place at parting then beneath his quiet roof without a word without a sigh retired scarce had the morrows sun his golden rays from sweet hymettus darted over the fanes of cecrops to the salaminian shores when lo on solons threshold met the feet of four athenians by the same sad care conducted all than whom the state beheld none nobler first came megacles the son of great alemeon whom the lydian king the mild unhappy croesus in his days of glory had with costly gifts adorned fair vessels splendid garments tinctured webs and heaps of treasured gold beyond the lot of many sovrans thus requiting well that hospitable favor which erewhile alemeon to his messengers had shown whom he with offerings worthy of the god sent from his throne in sardis to revere apollos delphick shrine with megacles approached his son whom agarista bore the virtuous child of clisthenes whose hand of grecian sceptres the most ancient far in sicyon swayed but greater fame he drew from arms controlled by justice from the love of the wise muses and the unenvied wreath which gla olympia gave for thither once his warlike steeds the hero led and there contended through the tumult of the course with skilful wheels then victor at the goal amid the applauses of assembled greece high on his car he stood and waved his arm silence ensued when straight the heralds voice was heard inviting every grecian youth whom clisthenes content might call his son to visit ere twice thirty days were passed the towers of sicyon there the chief decreed within the circuit of the following year to join at hymens altar hand in hand with his fair daughter him among the guests whom worthiest he should deem forthwith from all the bounds of greece the ambitious wooers came from rich hesperia from the illyrian shore where epidamnus over adrias surge looks on the setting sun from those brave tribes chaonian or molossian whom the race of great achilles governs glorying still in troy overthrown from rough aetolia nurse of men who first among the greeks threw off the yoke of kings to commerce and to arms devoted from thessalias fertile meads where flows peneus near the lofty walls of cranon old from strong eretria queen of all euboean cities who sublime on the steep margin of euripus views across the tide the marathonian plain not yet the haunt of glory athens too minervas care among her graceful sons found equal lovers for the princely maid nor was proud argos wanting nor the domes of sacred elis nor the arcadian groves that overshade alpheus echoing often some shepherds song but through the illustrious band was none who might with megacles compare in all the honors of unblemished youth his was the beauteous bride and now their son young clisthenes betimes at solons gate stood anxious leaning forward on the arm of his great sire with earnest eyes that asked when the slow hinge would turn with restless feet and cheeks now pale now glowing for his heart throbbd full of bursting passions anger grief with scorn embittered by the generous boy scarce understood but which like noble seeds are destined for his country and himself in riper years to bring forth fruits divine of liberty and glory next appeared two brave companions whom one mother bore to different lords but whom the better ties of firm esteem and friendship rendered more than brothers first miltiades who drew from godlike aeacus his ancient line that aeacus whose unimpeachd renown for sanctity and justice won the lyre of elder bards to celebrate him throned in hades over the dead where his decrees the guilty soul within the burning gates of tartarus compel or send the good to inhabit with eternal health and peace the valleys of elysium from a stem so sacred never could worthier scion spring than this miltiades whose aid ere long the chiefs of thrace already on their ways sent by the inspired foreknowing maid who sits upon the delphick tripod shall implore to wield their scepter and the rural wealth of fruitful chersonesus to protect with arms and laws but nothing careful now save for his injured country here he stands in deep solicitude with cimon joined unconscious both what widely different lots await them taught by nature as they are to know one common good one common ill for cimon not his valor not his birth derived from codrus not a thousand gifts dealt round him with a wise benignant hand no not the olympic olive by himself from his own brow transferred to sooth the mind of this pisistratus can long preserve from the sell envy of the tyrants sons and their assassin dagger but if death obscure upon his gentle steps attend yet fate an ample recompense prepares in his victorious son that other great miltiades who over the very throne of glory shall with times assiduous hand in adamantine characters engrave the name of athens and by freedom armed against the gigantick pride of asias king shall all the achievements of the heroes old surmount of hercules of all who sailed from thessaly with jason all who fought for empire or for fame at thebes or troy such were the patriots who within the porch of solon had assembled but the gate now opens and across the ample floor straight they proceed into an open space bright with the beams of morn a verdant spot where stands a rural altar pild with sods cut from the grassy turf and girt with wreaths of branching palm here solons self they found clad in a robe of purple pure and decked with leaves of olive on his reverend brow he bowed before the altar and over cakes of barley from two earthen vessels poured of honey and of milk a plenteous stream calling meantime the muses to accept his simple offering by no victim tinged with blood nor sullied by destroying fire but such as for himself apollo claims in his own delos where his favorite haunt is thence the altar of the pious named unseen the guests drew near and silent viewed that worship till the hero priest his eye turned towered a seat on which prepared there lay a branch of laurel then his friends confessed before him stood backward his step he drew as loath that care or tumult should approach those early rites divine but soon their looks so anxious and their hands held forth with such desponding gesture bring him on perforce to speak to their affliction are ye come he cried to mourn with me this common shame or ask ye some new effort which may break our fetters know then of the public cause not for yon traitors cunning or his might do i despair nor could i wish from jove aught dearer than at this late hour of life as once by laws so now by strenuous arms from impious violation to assert the rights our fathers left us but alas what arms or who shall wield them ye beheld the athenian people many bitter days must pass and many wounds from cruel pride be felt ere yet their partial hearts find room for just resentment or their hands endure to smite this tyrant brood so near to all their hopes so often admired so long beloved that time will come however be it yours to watch its fair approach and urge it on with honest prudence me it ill beseems again to supplicate th unwilling crowd to rescue from a vile deceivers hold that envied power which once with eager zel they offered to myself nor can i plunge in counsels deep and various nor prepare for distant wars thus faltring as i tread on lifes last verge ere long to join the shades of minos and lycurgus but behold what care employs me now my vows i pay to the sweet muses teachers of my youth and solace of my age if right i deem of the still voice that whispers at my heart the immortal sisters have not quite withdrawn their old harmonious influence let your tongues with sacred silence favor what i speak and happily shall my faithful lips be taught to unfold celestial counsels which may arm as with impenetrable steel your breasts for the long strife before you and repel the darts of adverse fate he said and snatched the laurel bough and sat in silence down fixed wrapped in solemn musing full before the sun who now from all his radiant orb drove the gray clouds and poured his genial light upon the breast of solon solon raised aloft the leasy rod and thus began ye beauteous offspring of olympian jove and memory divine pierian maids hear me propitious in the morn of life when hope shone bright and all the prospect smiled to your sequestered mansion often my steps were turned o muses and within your gate my offerings paid ye taught me then with strains of flowing harmony to soften wars dire voice or in fair colors that might charm the public eye to clothe the form austere of civil counsel now my feeble age neglected and supplanted of the hope on which it leaned yet sinks not but to you to your mild wisdom flies refuge beloved of solitude and silence ye can teach the visions of my bed whatever the gods in the rude ages of the world inspired or the first herdes acted ye can make the morning light more gladsome to my sense than ever it appeared to active youth pursuing careless pleasure ye can give to this long leisure these unheeded hours a labor as sublime as when the sons of athens thronged and speechless round me stood to hear pronounced for all their future deeds the bounds of right and wrong celestial powers i feel that ye are near me and behold to meet your energy divine i bring a high and sacred theme not less than those which to the eternal custody of fame your lips entrusted when of old ye deigned with orpheus or with homer to frequent the groves of hemus or the chian shore ye know harmonious maids for what of all my various life was ever from you estranged often has my solitary song to you revealed that duteous pride which turned my steps to willing exile earnest to withdraw from envy and the disappointed thirst of lucre lest the bold familiar strife which in the eye of athens they upheld against her legislator should impair with trivial doubt the reverence of his laws to egypt therefore through the aegean isles my course i steered and by the banks of nile dwelt in canopus thence the hallowed domes of sais and the rites to isis paid i sought and in her temples silent courts through many changing moons attentive heard the venerable sonchis while his tongue at morn or midnight the deep story told of her who represents whatever has been or is or shall be whose mysterious veil no mortal hand has ever yet removed by him exhorted southward to the walls of on i passed the city of the sun the ever youthful god t was there amid his priests and sages who the livelong night watch the dread movements of the starry sphere or who in wondrous fables half disclose the secrets of the elements it was there that great psenophis taught my raptured ears the same of old atlantis of her chiefs and her pure laws the first which earth obeyed deep in my bosom sunk the noble tale and often while i listened did my mind foretell with what delight her own free lyre should some time for an attick audience raise anew that losty scene and from their tombs call forth those ancient demigods to speak of justice and the hidden providence that walks among mankind but yet meantime the mystic pomp of ammons gloomy sons became less pleasing with contempt i gazed on that tame garb and those unvarying paths to which the double yoke of king and priest had cramped the sullen race at last with hymns invoking our own pallas and the gods of cheerful greece a glad farewell i gave to egypt and before the southern wind spread my full fails what climes i then surveyed what fortunes i encountered in the realm of croesus or upon the cyprian shore the muse who prompts my bosom does not now consent that i reveal but when at length ten times the sun returning from the south hadstrowdwith flowers the verdant earth and filled the groves with music pleased i then beheld the term of those long errors drawing nigh nor yet i said will i sit down within the walls of athens till my seet have trod the cretan soil have pierced those reverend haunts whence law and civil concord issued forth as from their ancient home and still to greece their wisest loftiest discipline proclaim straight where amnisus mart of wealthy ships appears beneath samd gnossus and her towers like the fair handmaid of a stately queen i checked my prow and thence with eager steps the city of minos entered o ye gods who taught the leaders of the simpler time by written words to curb the untowrd will of mortals how within that generous isle have ye the triumphs of your power displayed munificent those splendid merchants lords of traffic and the sea with what delight i saw them at their public meal like sons of the same household join the plainer sort whose wealth was only freedom whence to those vile envy and to those fantastic pride alike was strange but noble concord still cherished the strength untamed the rustic faith of their first fathers then the growing race how pleasing to behold them in their schools their sports their labors ever placed within o shade of minos thy controlling eye here was a docile band in tuneful tones thy laws pronouncing or with lofty hymns praising the bounteous gods or to preserve their countrys heroes from oblivious night resounding what the muse inspired of old there on the verge of manhood others met in heavy armor through the heats of noon to march the rugged mountains height to climb with measured swiftness from the hardbent bow to send resistless arrows to their mark or for the fame of prowess to contend now wrestling now with fists and staves opposed now with the biting falchion and the fence of brazen shields while still the warbling flute presided over the combat breathing strains grave solemn soft and changing headlong spite to thoughtful resolution cool and clear such i beheld those islanders renowned so tutored from their birth to meet in war each bold invader and in peace to guard that living flame of reverence for their laws which nor the storms of fortune nor the flood of foreign wealth diffused over all the land could quench or slacken first of human names in every cretans heart was minos still and holiest far of what the sun surveys through his whole course were those primeval seats which with religious footsteps he had taught their sires to approach the wild dictean cave where jove was born the ever verdant meads of ida and the spacious grotto where his active youth he passed and where his throne yet stands mysterious whither minos came each ninth returning year the king of gods and mortals there in secret to consult on justice and the tables of his law to inscribe anew often also with like zeal great rheas mansion from the gnossian gates men visit nor less often the antic fane built on that sacred spot along the banks of shady thereon where benignant jove and his majestic consort joined their hands and spoke their nuptial vows alas it was there that the dire same of athens sunk in bonds i first received what time an annual feast had summoned all the genial country round by sacrifice and pomp to bring to mind that first great spousal while the enamored youths and virgins with the priest before the shrine observe the same pure ritual and invoke the same glad omens there among the crowd of strangers from those naval cities drawn which deck like gems the islands northern shore a merchant of aegina i descried my ancient host but forward as i sprung to meet him he with dark dejected brow stopped half averse and o athenian guest he said art thou in crete these joyful rites partaking know thy laws are blotted out thy country kneels before a tyrants throne he added names of men with hostile deeds disastrous which obscure and indistinct i heard for while he spoke my heart grew cold and my eyes dim the altars and their train no more were present to me how i fared or whither turned i know not nor recall aught of those moments other than the sense of one who struggles in oppressive sleep and from the toils of some distressful dream to break away with palpitating heart weak limbs and temples bathed in deathlike dew makes many a painful effort when at last the sun and natures face again appeared not far i found me where the public path winding through cypress groves and swelling meads from gnossus to the cave of jove ascends heedless i followed on till soon the skirts of ida rose before me and the vault wideopning pierced the mountains rocky side entering within the threshold on the ground i slung me sad faint overworn with toil                the beginning of the fourth book of the pleasures of imagination mdcclxx one effort more one cheerful sally more our destined course will finish and in peace then for an offering sacred to the powers who lent us gracious guidance we will then inscribe a monument of deathless praise o my adventurous song with steady speed long have thou on an untried voyage bound sailed between earth and heaven have now surveyed stretched out beneath thee all the mazy tracks of passion and opinion like a waste of sands and flowery lawns and tangling woods where mortals roam bewildered and have now exulting soared among the worlds above or hovered near the eternal gates of heaven if happily the discourses of the gods a curious but an unpresuming guest thou might partake and carry back some strain of divine wisdom lawful to repeat and apt to be conceived of man below a different task remains the secret paths of early genius to explore to trace those haunts where fancy her predestined sons like to the demigods of old does nurse remote from eyes profane ye happy souls who now her tender discipline obey where dwell ye what wild rivers brink at eve imprint your steps what solemn groves at noon use

the giant flood obliquely strides and his banks open and his lawns extend stops short the pleased traveller to view presiding over the scene some rustic tower founded by norman or by saxon hands o ye northumbrian shades which overlook the rocky pavement and the mossy falls of solitary wensbecks limpid stream how gladly i recall your wellknown seats beloved of old and that delightful time when all alone for many a summers day i wandered through your calm recesses led in silence by some powerful hand unseen nor will i ever forget you nor shall ever the graver tasks of manhood or the advice of vulgar wisdom move me to disclaim those studies which possessed me in the dawn of life and fixed the color of my mind for every future year whence even now from sleep i rescue the clear hours of morn

unnoticd lie these pleasing stores unless the casual force of things external prompt the heedless mind to recognize her wealth but some there are conscious of nature and the rule which man over nature
