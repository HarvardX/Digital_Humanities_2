doubtful worth the pageant of the passing hour teach me to paint in deathless song some darling from thy filial throng whose deeds no partyrage inspire but fill the agreeing world with one desire to echo his renown responsive to my lyre ah whither leadst thou  whence that sigh what sound of woe my bosom jars why pass where miserys hollow eye glares wildly through those gloomy bars is virtue sunk in these abodes where keen remorse the heart corrodes where guilts base blood with frenzy boils and blasphemy the mournful scene embroils  from this infernal gloom my shuddring soul recoils but whence those sudden sacred beams oppression drops his iron rod and all the brightning dungeon seems to speak the presence of a god philanthropys descending ray diffuses unexpected day loveliest of angels  at her side her favorite votary stands  her english pride through horrors mansions led by this celestial guide hail generous howard though thou bear a name which glorys hand sublime has blazoned often with guardian care in characters that fear not time for thee she fondly spreads her wings for thee from paradise she brings more verdant than her laurel bough such wreaths of sacred palm as never till now the smiling seraph twined around a mortal brow that heros charles howard earl of nottingham praise shall ever bloom who shielded our insulted coast and launched his lightning to consume the proud invaders routed host brave perils raised his noble name but thou derivst thy matchless fame from scenes where deadlier danger dwells where fierce contagion with affright repels valors adventurous step from her malignant cells where in the dungeons loathsome shade the speechless captive clanks his chain with heartless hope to raise that aid his feeble cries have called in vain thine eye his dumb complaint explores thy voice his parting breath restores thy cares his ghastly visage clear from deaths chill dew with many a clotted tear and to his thankful soul returning life endear what precious drug or stronger charm thy constant fortitude inspires in scenes whence muttering her alarm medicine mussabat tacito medecina timore lugretius  with selfish dread retires nor charm nor drug dispel thy fears temperance thy better guard appears for thee i see her fondly fill her crystal cup from natures purest rill chief nourisher of life best antidote of ill i see the hallowed shade of hales stephen hales minister of teddington he died at the age of         and has been justly called an ornament to his profession as a clergyman and to his country as a philosopher i had the happiness of knowing this excellent man when i was very young and well remember the warm glow of benevolence which used to animate his countenance in relating the success of his various projects for the benefit of mankind i have frequently heard him dwell with great pleasure on the fortunate incident which led him to the discovery of his ventilator to which i have alluded  he had ordered a new floor for one of his rooms his carpenter not having prepared the work so soon as he expected he thought the season improper for laying down new boards when they were brought to his house and gave orders for their being deposited in his barn  from their accidental position in that place he cauglit his first idea of this useful invention    who felt like thee for human woe and taught the healthdiffusing gales through horrors murky cells to blow as thy protecting angel wait to save thee from the snares of fate commissioned from the eternal throne i hear him praise in wonders warmest tone the virtues of thy heart more active than his own thy soul supplies new funds of health that fail not in the trying hour above arabias spicy wealth and pharmacys reviving power the transports of the generous mind feeling its bounty to mankind inspirit every mortal part and far more potent than precarious art give radiance to the eye and vigor to the heart blessed howard who like thee can feel this vital spring in all its force new star of philanthropic zeal enlightning nations in thy course and shedding comforts heavenly dew on meagre wants deserted crew friend to the wretch whom friends disclaim who feels stern justice in his famished frame a persecuting fiend beneath an angels name authority unfeeling power whose iron heart can coldly doom the debtor dragged from pleasures bower to sicken in the dungeons gloom o might thy terrorstriking call profusions sons alone enthrall but thou can want with guilt confound thy bonds the man of virtuous toil surround driven by malicious fate within thy dreary bound how savage are thy stern decrees thy cruel minister i see a weak laborious victim seize by worth entitled to be free behold in the afflicting strife the faithful partner of his life in vain thy ruthless servant court to spare her little childrens sole support whom this terrific form has frightened from their sport nor weeps she only from the thought those infants must no longer share his aid whose daily labor bought the pittance of their scanty fare the horrors of the loathsome jail her inlybleeding heart assail even now her fears from fondness bred see the lost partner of her faithful bed drop in that murderous scene his pale expiring head take comfort yet in these keen pains fond mourner check thy gushing tears the dungeon now no more contains those perils which thy fancy fears no more contagions baleful breath speaks it the hideous cave of death howard has planted safety there pure minister of light his heavenly care has purged the damp of death from that polluted air his care exulting britain found here first displayed not here confined no single tract of earth could bound the active virtues of his mind to all the lands wherever the tear that mourned the prisoners wrongs severe sad pitys glistning cheek impearld eager he steered with every sail unfurled a friend to every clime a patriot of the world ye nations through whose fair domain our flying sons of joy have past by pleasure driven with loosened rein astonished that they flew so fast how did the heartimproving sight awake your wonder and delight when in her unexampled chase philanthropy outstript keen pleasures pace when with a warmer soul she ran a nobler race wherever her generous briton went princes his supplicants became he seemed the enquiring angel sent to scrutinize their secret shame i am credibly informed that several princes or at least persons in authothority requested mr howard not to publish a minute account of some prisons which reflected disgrace on their government  captivity where he appeared her languid head with transport reared and gazing on her godlike guest like those of old whom heavens pure servant blessed even by his shadow seemed of demons dispossessed amazed her foreign children cry seeing their patron pass along o who is he whose daring eye can search into our hidden wrong what monarchs heavendirected mind with royal bounty unconfined has tempted freedoms son to share these perils searching with an angels care each cell of dire disease each cavern of despair no monarchs word nor lucres lust nor vain ambitions restless fire nor ample power that sacred trust his lifediffusing toils inspire roused by no voice save that whose cries internal bid the soul arise from joys that only seem to bless from low pursuits which little minds possess to natures noblest aim the succor of distress taught by that god in mercys robe who his celestial throne resigned to free the prison of the globe from vice the oppressor of the mind for thee of miserys rights bereft for thee captivity he left fair fortunes lap who far from coy bade him with smiles his golden hours employ in her delicious bower the festive scene of joy while to thy virtues utmost scope i boldly strive my aim to raise as high as mortal hand may hope to shoot the glittering shaft of praise  pindar  say howard say what may the muse whose melting eye thy merit views what guerdon may her love design what may she ask for thee from power divine above the rich rewards which are already thine sweet is the joy when science flings her light on philosophic thought when genius with keen ardor springs to clasp the lovely truth he sought sweet is the joy when raptures fire flows from the spirit of the lyre when liberty and virtue roll springtides of fancy over the poets soul that wast his flying bark through seas above the pole sweet the delight when the galled heart feels consolations lenient hand bind up the wound from fortunes dart with friendships lifesupporting band and sweeter still and far above these fainter joys when purest love the soul his willing captive keeps when he in bliss the melting spirit steeps who drops delicious tears and wonders that he weeps but not the brightest joy which arts in floods of mental light bestow nor what firm friendships zeal imparts blessed antidote of bitterest woe nor those that loves sweet hours dispense can equal the ecstatic sense when swelling to a fond excess the grateful praises of relieved distress reechoed through the heart the soul of bounty bless these transports in no common state supremely pure sublimely strong above the reach of envious fate blessed howard these to thee belong while years increasing over thee roll long may this sunshine of the soul new vigor to thy frame convey its radiance through thy noon of life display and with serenest light adorn thy closing day and when the power who joys to save proclaims the guilt of earth forgiven and calls the prisoners of the grave to all the liberty of heaven in that bright day whose wonders blind the eye of the astonished mind when lifes glad angel shall resume his ancient sway announce to death his doom and from existence drive that tyrant of the tomb in that blessed hour when seraphs sing the triumphs gained in human strife and to their new associates bring the wreaths of everlasting life may thou in glorys hallowed blaze approach the eternal fount of praise with those who lead the angelic van those pure adherents to their saviors plan who lived but to relieve the miseries of man finis
