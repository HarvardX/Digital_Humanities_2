captain toms remembrance to his old friends the mobb of london westminster southwark and wapping gentlemen for so i love still to call you on the score of old acquaintance and friendship i take this occasion to wish you joy on the happy deliverance of our good queen from the bloody design of the popish assassin count guiscard and on your own escape at the same time from being dragoond into popery and slavery and becoming hewers of wood and drawers of water to the french king and his journyman the pretender for could his unchristian majesty have once got the collar on your necks and saddled you with the st germains yonker pray think what a whipping bill of charges he would have brought in for nursing boarding and tutoring that babe of grace he has no conscience you know in his demands and a child so dutifully bred up as that is would not have had the boldness to higgle with his fosterfather and make him abate no he would have paid him to the full and you must have found wherewithal to quit the reckoning and so your selves and your sons must have been chained to the oar and turned swabbers under french boatswains or been transported into foreign countries to have had your brains knocked out in the french kings quarrel to make him monarch of all europe and your wives and daughters must some of em have been common strumpets to an outlandish jacobite army and others the handsomest of em have been mewed up in nunnerys for the use of priests and friars  instead of substantial beef and pudding your stomachs would have been taken down with brown husky bread and herbs and rotgutsoop and for sunday apparel you must have been content with coarse tattered jackets canvass shirts and wooden shoes thus my boys you had for ever lost all the pleasures of easter whitsontide and christmas no more holy day clothes no more cakes and ale no more beans and bacon in the summer no more plumporridge mincepyes and roasted sirloins in the winter  instead of being eased of taxes the nation must have been drained to satisfy the french king for the expenses of the war and this would have been skrewd up to one hundred and fifty millions at least besides the charge of keeping a standing army at home and troops abroad to help him to ruin the allies all this money you may be sure could never be raised without selling the land and the stock and shipping of great britain and then what would you have done for employment to get your living  the popish gimcracks and idolatry must have been set up in your churches your benefices have been given to romish priests and the chief of our protestant lords gentlemen and clergy must have been murdered in their houses butchered in the streets or pild up in smithfield bonfires and you must have carried faggots to the flames or have been fried your selves for it is impossible the french and their st germains nursling and popery and slavery should be established in this island without making a wilderness of our country a sacrifice of our persons and a seizure of our estates  dont think gentlemen i carry things too far here consider how the french king has laid waste his own country in order to establish arbitrary power and romish bigotry in it call to mind how many massacres the papists have made in france since the reformation how many hundred thousands of his own protestant subjects that king has destroyed by sword jails galleys and banishment and can you imagine that he and the pretender would use british protestants better consider how many protestant countries he has ruined in germany and forced the inhabitants to beg their bread in other lands and do you believe he would be more favorable to great britain which has been the chief hindrance of his becoming universal monarch call to mind how the late king james cut off your noble patriots under the notion of plotters how he sent your bishops to the tower filled your armies universitys and councils with papists and set up a high commission court to turn out the best of your clergy remember how he designed to govern you with a standing army and impose a shamsuccessor on you to make popery and slavery perpetual how did you bless the day when our late glorious deliverer the prince of orange arrived to rescue you from all these miserys did not your hearts overflow with joy and did not you shout him to town with loud acclamations as the savior under god of our church and state did not you then take heart of grace and under my conduct rout the monks and priests frighten the standing army of the popish king and force him and his irish teagues to scamper did we not on all occasions stand by the revolution heart and hand in which we and our brethren all over the kingdom had so great a share and yet to see the impudence of a late gallimaufry of mercenary tatterdemalions they would fain top it on the world that forsooth this same freeborn mob of great britain had forsworn their principles turned tail and become arrant enemies to the revolution and to the memory of the glorious prince who was the instrument of it and had run in with a herd of jacobites and papists to raise tumults and rebellions  but to prevent your being gulled with any flamstorys they may buz in your ears pray consider gentlemen if guiscard and his fellow bravos had carried their point to murder the queen and your best patriots and to fire the city what havoc the pretender and the d of berwick would have made among you with their french irish and popish cutthroats while we had no army to oppose them nor any protestant prince to make head against them  gentlemen i hope these things have opened your eyes and brought you to your senses and that you are convinced of the errors some of your number have been drawn into and of the knavery of those who misled them and began to act the tragedy last winter that was to have been concluded in this attend therefore to the advice of your old captain who exhorts you to continue faithful in the duty you owe to your queen and country to the protestant succession to your religion and liberty and to your selves and families as becomes true britains and to be ever ready to defend all these against papists and jacobites who are still brewing their plots and endeavoring to disgrace and ruin the authentic mob of great britain by false spurious antimobs of their own cast but i am confident you understand your selves better than to be thus deceived and that you will take care not to forfeit your former honor and the favor of your old trusty leader  tom
